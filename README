INTRO:
    Thanks to Dr. Grigori Sidorov et al. [1] for sharing their evaluation
    corpus of 7 authors.

    This repository provides a parsed version of that corpus. As the process is
    computationally expensive, I found sharing it useful.

    For inquiries email m [ta] khonji [tod] org.

    stanford-parser-full-2014-10-31

    'java' was executd with -xm14000m as some books contained very long
    sentences. To be specific, below is a modified version Stanford's
    lexparser.sh script.

    #

    if [ ! $# -ge 1 ]; then
      echo Usage: `basename $0` 'file(s)'
      echo
      exit
    fi
    
    scriptdir=`dirname $0`
    
    java -mx14000m -cp "$scriptdir/*:" edu.stanford.nlp.parser.lexparser.LexicalizedParser \
