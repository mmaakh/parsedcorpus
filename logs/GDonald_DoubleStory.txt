Parsing [sent. 1 len. 7]: A DOUBLE STORY BY GEORGE MACDONALD .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 8]: NEW YORK : A DOUBLE STORY I .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 13]: There was a certain country where things used to go rather oddly .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 28]: For instance , you could never tell whether it was going to rain or hail , or whether or not the milk was going to turn sour .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 36]: It was impossible to say whether the next baby would be a boy , or a girl , or even , after he was a week old , whether he would wake sweet-tempered or cross .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 236]: In strict accordance with the peculiar nature of this country of uncertainties , it came to pass one day , that in the midst of a shower of rain that might well be called golden , seeing the sun , shining as it fell , turned all its drops into molten topazes , and every drop was good for a grain of golden corn , or a yellow cowslip , or a buttercup , or a dandelion at least ; -- while this splendid rain was falling , I say , with a musical patter upon the great leaves of the horse-chestnuts , which hung like Vandyke collars about the necks of the creamy , red-spotted blossoms , and on the leaves of the sycamores , looking as if they had blood in their veins , and on a multitude of flowers , of which some stood up and boldly held out their cups to catch their share , while others cowered down , laughing , under the soft patting blows of the heavy warm drops ; -- while this lovely rain was washing all the air clean from the motes , and the bad odors , and the poison-seeds that had escaped from their prisons during the long drought ; -- while it fell , splashing and sparkling , with a hum , and a rush , and a soft clashing -- but stop !
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 26]: I am stealing , I find , and not that only , but with clumsy hands spoiling what I steal : -- `` O Rain !
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 21]: with your dull twofold sound , The clash hard by , and the murmur all round : '' -- there !
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 194]: take it , Mr. Coleridge ; -- while , as I was saying , the lovely little rivers whose fountains are the clouds , and which cut their own channels through the air , and make sweet noises rubbing against their banks as they hurry down and down , until at length they are pulled up on a sudden , with a musical plash , in the very heart of an odorous flower , that first gasps and then sighs up a blissful scent , or on the bald head of a stone that never says , Thank you ; -- while the very sheep felt it blessing them , though it could never reach their skins through the depth of their long wool , and the veriest hedgehog -- I mean the one with the longest spikes -- came and spiked himself out to impale as many of the drops as he could ; -- while the rain was thus falling , and the leaves , and the flowers , and the sheep , and the cattle , and the hedgehog , were all busily receiving the golden rain , something happened .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 25]: It was not a great battle , nor an earthquake , nor a coronation , but something more important than all those put together .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 73]: A BABY-GIRL WAS BORN ; and her father was a king ; and her mother was a queen ; and her uncles and aunts were princes and princesses ; and her first-cousins were dukes and duchesses ; and not one of her second-cousins was less than a marquis or marchioness , or of their third-cousins less than an earl or countess : and below a countess they did not care to count .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 26]: So the little girl was Somebody ; and yet for all that , strange to say , the first thing she did was to cry .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 9]: I told you it was a strange country .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 68]: As she grew up , everybody about her did his best to convince her that she was Somebody ; and the girl herself was so easily persuaded of it that she quite forgot that anybody had ever told her so , and took it for a fundamental , innate , primary , first-born , self-evident , necessary , and incontrovertible idea and principle that SHE WAS SOMEBODY .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 10]: And far be it from me to deny it .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 22]: I will even go so far as to assert that in this odd country there was a huge number of Somebodies .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 52]: Indeed , it was one of its oddities that every boy and girl in it , was rather too ready to think he or she was Somebody ; and the worst of it was that the princess never thought of there being more than one Somebody -- and that was herself .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 152]: Far away to the north in the same country , on the side of a bleak hill , where a horse-chestnut or a sycamore was never seen , where were no meadows rich with buttercups , only steep , rough , breezy slopes , covered with dry prickly furze and its flowers of red gold , or moister , softer broom with its flowers of yellow gold , and great sweeps of purple heather , mixed with bilberries , and crowberries , and cranberries -- no , I am all wrong : there was nothing out yet but a few furze-blossoms ; the rest were all waiting behind their doors till they were called ; and no full , slow-gliding river with meadow-sweet along its oozy banks , only a little brook here and there , that dashed past without a moment to say , `` How do you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 9]: -- there -LRB- would you believe it ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 141]: while the same cloud that was dropping down golden rain all about the queen 's new baby was dashing huge fierce handfuls of hail upon the hills , with such force that they flew spinning off the rocks and stones , went burrowing in the sheep 's wool , stung the cheeks and chin of the shepherd with their sharp spiteful little blows , and made his dog wink and whine as they bounded off his hard wise head , and long sagacious nose ; only , when they dropped plump down the chimney , and fell hissing in the little fire , they caught it then , for the clever little fire soon sent them up the chimney again , a good deal swollen , and harmless enough for a while , there -LRB- what do you think ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 44]: among the hailstones , and the heather , and the cold mountain air , another little girl was born , whom the shepherd her father , and the shepherdess her mother , and a good many of her kindred too , thought Somebody .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 45]: She had not an uncle or an aunt that was less than a shepherd or dairymaid , not a cousin , that was less than a farm-laborer , not a second-cousin that was less than a grocer , and they did not count farther .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 9]: And yet -LRB- would you believe it ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 8]: she too cried the very first thing .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 6]: It WAS an odd country !
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 76]: And , what is still more surprising , the shepherd and shepherdess and the dairymaids and the laborers were not a bit wiser than the king and the queen and the dukes and the marquises and the earls ; for they too , one and all , so constantly taught the little woman that she was Somebody , that she also forgot that there were a great many more Somebodies besides herself in the world .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 69]: It was , indeed , a peculiar country , very different from ours -- so different , that my reader must not be too much surprised when I add the amazing fact , that most of its inhabitants , instead of enjoying the things they had , were always wanting the things they had not , often even the things it was least likely they ever could have .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 55]: The grown men and women being like this , there is no reason to be further astonished that the Princess Rosamond -- the name her parents gave her because it means Rose of the World -- should grow up like them , wanting every thing she could and every thing she could n't have .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 46]: The things she could have were a great many too many , for her foolish parents always gave her what they could ; but still there remained a few things they could n't give her , for they were only a common king and queen .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 49]: They could and did give her a lighted candle when she cried for it , and managed by much care that she should not burn her fingers or set her frock on fire ; but when she cried for the moon , that they could not give her .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 21]: They did the worst thing possible , instead , however ; for they pretended to do what they could not .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 33]: They got her a thin disc of brilliantly polished silver , as near the size of the moon as they could agree upon ; and , for a time she was delighted .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 28]: But , unfortunately , one evening she made the discovery that her moon was a little peculiar , inasmuch as she could not shine in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 29]: Her nurse happened to snuff out the candles as she was playing with it ; and instantly came a shriek of rage , for her moon had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 68]: Presently , through the opening of the curtains , she caught sight of the real moon , far away in the sky , and shining quite calmly , as if she had been there all the time ; and her rage increased to such a degree that if it had not passed off in a fit , I do not know what might have come of it .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 38]: As she grew up it was still the same , with this difference , that not only must she have every thing , but she got tired of every thing almost as soon as she had it .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 18]: There was an accumulation of things in her nursery and schoolroom and bedroom that was perfectly appalling .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 24]: Her mother 's wardrobes were almost useless to her , so packed were they with things of which she never took any notice .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 33]: When she was five years old , they gave her a splendid gold repeater , so close set with diamonds and rubies , that the back was just one crust of gems .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 44]: In one of her little tempers , as they called her hideously ugly rages , she dashed it against the back of the chimney , after which it never gave a single tick ; and some of the diamonds went to the ash-pit .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 27]: As she grew older still , she became fond of animals , not in a way that brought them much pleasure , or herself much satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 33]: When angry , she would beat them , and try to pull them to pieces , and as soon as she became a little used to them , would neglect them altogether .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 16]: Then , if they could , they would run away , and she was furious .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 24]: Some white mice , which she had ceased feeding altogether , did so ; and soon the palace was swarming with white mice .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 47]: Their red eyes might be seen glowing , and their white skins gleaming , in every dark corner ; but when it came to the king 's finding a nest of them in his second-best crown , he was angry and ordered them to be drowned .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 42]: The princess heard of it , however , and raised such a clamor , that there they were left until they should run away of themselves ; and the poor king had to wear his best crown every day till then .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 22]: Nothing that was the princess 's property , whether she cared for it or not , was to be meddled with .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 19]: Of course , as she grew , she grew worse ; for she never tried to grow better .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 37]: She became more and more peevish and fretful every day -- dissatisfied not only with what she had , but with all that was around her , and constantly wishing things in general to be different .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 30]: She found fault with every thing and everybody , and all that happened , and grew more and more disagreeable to every one who had to do with her .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 37]: At last , when she had nearly killed her nurse , and had all but succeeded in hanging herself , and was miserable from morning to night , her parents thought it time to do something .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 22]: A long way from the palace , in the heart of a deep wood of pine-trees , lived a wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 37]: In some countries she would have been called a witch ; but that would have been a mistake , for she never did any thing wicked , and had more power than any witch could have .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 32]: As her fame was spread through all the country , the king heard of her ; and , thinking she might perhaps be able to suggest something , sent for her .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 38]: In the dead of the night , lest the princess should know it , the king 's messenger brought into the palace a tall woman , muffled from head to foot in a cloak of black cloth .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 36]: In the presence of both their Majesties , the king , to do her honor , requested her to sit ; but she declined , and stood waiting to hear what they had to say .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 77]: Nor had she to wait long , for almost instantly they began to tell her the dreadful trouble they were in with their only child ; first the king talking , then the queen interposing with some yet more dreadful fact , and at times both letting out a torrent of words together , so anxious were they to show the wise woman that their perplexity was real , and their daughter a very terrible one .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 12]: For a long while there appeared no sign of approaching pause .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 19]: But the wise woman stood patiently folded in her black cloak , and listened without word or motion .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 31]: At length silence fell ; for they had talked themselves tired , and could not think of any thing more to add to the list of their child 's enormities .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 70]: After a minute , the wise woman unfolded her arms ; and her cloak dropping open in front , disclosed a garment made of a strange stuff , which an old poet who knew her well has thus described : -- `` All lilly white , withoutten spot or pride , That seemd like silke and silver woven neare ; But neither silke nor silver therein did appeare . ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 10]: `` How very badly you have treated her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 5]: said the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 5]: `` Poor child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 6]: `` Treated her badly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 4]: gasped the king .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 19]: `` She is a very wicked child , '' said the queen ; and both glared with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 6]: `` Yes , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 5]: returned the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 25]: `` She is very naughty indeed , and that she must be made to feel ; but it is half your fault too . ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 4]: stammered the king .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 13]: `` Have n't we given her every mortal thing she wanted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 19]: `` Surely , '' said the wise woman : `` what else could have all but killed her ?
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 13]: You should have given her a few things of the other sort .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 11]: But you are far too dull to understand me . ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 21]: `` You are very polite , '' remarked the king , with royal sarcasm on his thin , straight lips .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 29]: The wise woman made no answer beyond a deep sigh ; and the king and queen sat silent also in their anger , glaring at the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 35]: The silence lasted again for a minute , and then the wise woman folded her cloak around her , and her shining garment vanished like the moon when a great cloud comes over her .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 25]: Yet another minute passed and the silence endured , for the smouldering wrath of the king and queen choked the channels of their speech .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 14]: Then the wise woman turned her back on them , and so stood .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 38]: At this , the rage of the king broke forth ; and he cried to the queen , stammering in his fierceness , -- `` How should such an old hag as that teach Rosamond good manners ?
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 7]: She knows nothing of them herself !
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 5]: Look how she stands !
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 9]: -- actually with her back to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 11]: At the word the wise woman walked from the room .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 33]: The great folding doors fell to behind her ; and the same moment the king and queen were quarrelling like apes as to which of them was to blame for her departure .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 73]: Before their altercation was over , for it lasted till the early morning , in rushed Rosamond , clutching in her hand a poor little white rabbit , of which she was very fond , and from which , only because it would not come to her when she called it , she was pulling handfuls of fur in the attempt to tear the squealing , pink-eared , red-eyed thing to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 6]: `` Rosa , RosaMOND ! ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 15]: cried the queen ; whereupon Rosamond threw the rabbit in her mother 's face .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 14]: The king started up in a fury , and ran to seize her .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 7]: She darted shrieking from the room .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 25]: The king rushed after her ; but , to his amazement , she was nowhere to be seen : the huge hall was empty .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 41]: -- No : just outside the door , close to the threshold , with her back to it , sat the figure of the wise woman , muffled in her dark cloak , with her head bowed over her knees .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 24]: As the king stood looking at her , she rose slowly , crossed the hall , and walked away down the marble staircase .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 23]: The king called to her ; but she never turned her head , or gave the least sign that she heard him .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 30]: So quietly did she pass down the wide marble stair , that the king was all but persuaded he had seen only a shadow gliding across the white steps .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 11]: For the princess , she was nowhere to be found .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 12]: The queen went into hysterics ; and the rabbit ran away .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 13]: The king sent out messengers in every direction , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 22]: In a short time the palace was quiet -- as quiet as it used to be before the princess was born .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 59]: The king and queen cried a little now and then , for the hearts of parents were in that country strangely fashioned ; and yet I am afraid the first movement of those very hearts would have been a jump of terror if the ears above them had heard the voice of Rosamond in one of the corridors .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 20]: As for the rest of the household , they could not have made up a single tear amongst them .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 51]: They thought , whatever it might be for the princess , it was , for every one else , the best thing that could have happened ; and as to what had become of her , if their heads were puzzled , their hearts took no interest in the question .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 19]: The lord-chancellor alone had an idea about it , but he was far too wise to utter it .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 2]: II .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 24]: The fact , as is plain , was , that the princess had disappeared in the folds of the wise woman 's cloak .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 23]: When she rushed from the room , the wise woman caught her to her bosom and flung the black garment around her .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 57]: The princess struggled wildly , for she was in fierce terror , and screamed as loud as choking fright would permit her ; but her father , standing in the door , and looking down upon the wise woman , saw never a movement of the cloak , so tight was she held by her captor .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 44]: He was indeed aware of a most angry crying , which reminded him of his daughter ; but it sounded to him so far away , that he took it for the passion of some child in the street , outside the palace-gates .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 83]: Hence , unchallenged , the wise woman carried the princess down the marble stairs , out at the palace-door , down a great flight of steps outside , across a paved court , through the brazen gates , along half-roused streets where people were opening their shops , through the huge gates of the city , and out into the wide road , vanishing northwards ; the princess struggling and screaming all the time , and the wise woman holding her tight .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 38]: When at length she was too tired to struggle or scream any more , the wise woman unfolded her cloak , and set her down ; and the princess saw the light and opened her swollen eyelids .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 12]: There was nothing in sight that she had ever seen before .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 6]: City and palace had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 31]: They were upon a wide road going straight on , with a ditch on each side of it , that behind them widened into the great moat surrounding the city .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 22]: She cast up a terrified look into the wise woman 's face , that gazed down upon her gravely and kindly .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 11]: Now the princess did not in the least understand kindness .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 13]: She always took it for a sign either of partiality or fear .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 71]: So when the wise woman looked kindly upon her , she rushed at her , butting with her head like a ram : but the folds of the cloak had closed around the wise woman ; and , when the princess ran against it , she found it hard as the cloak of a bronze statue , and fell back upon the road with a great bruise on her head .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 39]: The wise woman lifted her again , and put her once more under the cloak , where she fell asleep , and where she awoke again only to find that she was still being carried on and on .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 31]: When at length the wise woman again stopped and set her down , she saw around her a bright moonlit night , on a wide heath , solitary and houseless .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 33]: Here she felt more frightened than before ; nor was her terror assuaged when , looking up , she saw a stern , immovable countenance , with cold eyes fixedly regarding her .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 28]: All she knew of the world being derived from nursery-tales , she concluded that the wise woman was an ogress , carrying her home to eat her .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 31]: I have already said that the princess was , at this time of her life , such a low-minded creature , that severity had greater influence over her than kindness .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 8]: She understood terror better far than tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 34]: When the wise woman looked at her thus , she fell on her knees , and held up her hands to her , crying , -- `` Oh , do n't eat me !
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 6]: do n't eat me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 19]: Now this being the best SHE could do , it was a sign she was a low creature .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 14]: Think of it -- to kick at kindness , and kneel from terror .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 29]: But the sternness on the face of the wise woman came from the same heart and the same feeling as the kindness that had shone from it before .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 28]: The only thing that could save the princess from her hatefulness , was that she should be made to mind somebody else than her own miserable Somebody .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 34]: Without saying a word , the wise woman reached down her hand , took one of Rosamond 's , and , lifting her to her feet , led her along through the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 71]: Every now and then a gush of obstinacy would well up in the heart of the princess , and she would give a great ill-tempered tug , and pull her hand away ; but then the wise woman would gaze down upon her with such a look , that she instantly sought again the hand she had rejected , in pure terror lest she should be eaten upon the spot .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 33]: And so they would walk on again ; and when the wind blew the folds of the cloak against the princess , she found them soft as her mother 's camel-hair shawl .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 57]: After a little while the wise woman began to sing to her , and the princess could not help listening ; for the soft wind amongst the low dry bushes of the heath , the rustle of their own steps , and the trailing of the wise woman 's cloak , were the only sounds beside .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 33]: And this is the song she sang : -- Out in the cold , With a thin-worn fold Of withered gold Around her rolled , Hangs in the air the weary moon .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 34]: She is old , old , old ; And her bones all cold , And her tales all told , And her things all sold , And she has no breath to croon .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 11]: Like a castaway clout , She is quite shut out !
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 21]: She might call and shout , But no one about Would ever call back , `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 28]: There is never a hut , Not a door to shut , Not a footpath or rut , Long road or short cut , Leading to anywhere !
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 14]: She is all alone Like a dog-picked bone , The poor old crone !
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 13]: She fain would groan , But she can not find the breath .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 31]: She once had a fire ; But she built it no higher , And only sat nigher Till she saw it expire ; And now she is cold as death .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 9]: She never will smile All the lonesome while .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 11]: Oh the mile after mile , And never a stile !
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 8]: And never a tree or a stone !
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 30]: She has not a tear : Afar and anear It is all so drear , But she does not care , Her heart is as dry as a bone .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 6]: None to come near her !
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 6]: No one to cheer her !
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 6]: No one to jeer her !
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 6]: No one to hear her !
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 8]: Not a thing to lift and hold !
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 29]: She is always awake , But her heart will not break : She can only quake , Shiver , and shake : The old woman is very cold .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 17]: As strange as the song , was the crooning wailing tune that the wise woman sung .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 23]: At the first note almost , you would have thought she wanted to frighten the princess ; and so indeed she did .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 22]: For when people WILL be naughty , they have to be frightened , and they are not expected to like it .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 22]: The princess grew angry , pulled her hand away , and cried , -- `` YOU are the ugly old woman .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 5]: I hate you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 33]: Therewith she stood still , expecting the wise woman to stop also , perhaps coax her to go on : if she did , she was determined not to move a step .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 21]: But the wise woman never even looked about : she kept walking on steadily , the same space as before .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 22]: Little Obstinate thought for certain she would turn ; for she regarded herself as much too precious to be left behind .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 19]: But on and on the wise woman went , until she had vanished away in the dim moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 27]: Then all at once the princess perceived that she was left alone with the moon , looking down on her from the height of her loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 17]: She was horribly frightened , and began to run after the wise woman , calling aloud .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 28]: But the song she had just heard came back to the sound of her own running feet , -- All all alone , Like a dog-picked bone !
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 25]: and again , -- She might call and shout , And no one about Would ever call back , `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 7]: and she screamed as she ran .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 22]: How she wished she knew the old woman 's name , that she might call it after her through the moonlight !
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 25]: But the wise woman had , in truth , heard the first sound of her running feet , and stopped and turned , waiting .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 56]: What with running and crying , however , and a fall or two as she ran , the princess never saw her until she fell right into her arms -- and the same moment into a fresh rage ; for as soon as any trouble was over the princess was always ready to begin another .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 22]: The wise woman therefore pushed her away , and walked on ; while the princess ran scolding and storming after her .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 14]: She had to run till , from very fatigue , her rudeness ceased .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 16]: Her heart gave way ; she burst into tears , and ran on silently weeping .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 22]: A minute more and the wise woman stooped , and lifting her in her arms , folded her cloak around her .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 22]: Instantly she fell asleep , and slept as soft and as soundly as if she had been in her own bed .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 61]: She slept till the moon went down ; she slept till the sun rose up ; she slept till he climbed the topmost sky ; she slept till he went down again , and the poor old moon came peaking and peering out once more : and all that time the wise woman went walking on and on very fast .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 19]: And now they had reached a spot where a few fir-trees came to meet them through the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 39]: At the same time the princess awaked , and popping her head out between the folds of the wise woman 's cloak -- a very ugly little owlet she looked -- saw that they were entering the wood .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 25]: Now there is something awful about every wood , especially in the moonlight ; and perhaps a fir-wood is more awful than other woods .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 68]: For one thing , it lets a little more light through , rendering the darkness a little more visible , as it were ; and then the trees go stretching away up towards the moon , and look as if they cared nothing about the creatures below them -- not like the broad trees with soft wide leaves that , in the darkness even , look sheltering .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 15]: So the princess is not to be blamed that she was very much frightened .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 58]: She is hardly to be blamed either that , assured the wise woman was an ogress carrying her to her castle to eat her up , she began again to kick and scream violently , as those of my readers who are of the same sort as herself will consider the right and natural thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 45]: The wrong in her was this -- that she had led such a bad life , that she did not know a good woman when she saw her ; took her for one like herself , even after she had slept in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 22]: Immediately the wise woman set her down , and , walking on , within a few paces vanished among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 35]: Then the cries of the princess rent the air , but the fir-trees never heeded her ; not one of their hard little needles gave a single shiver for all the noise she made .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 25]: But there were creatures in the forest who were soon quite as much interested in her cries as the fir-trees were indifferent to them .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 33]: They began to hearken and howl and snuff about , and run hither and thither , and grin with their white teeth , and light up the green lamps in their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 39]: In a minute or two a whole army of wolves and hyenas were rushing from all quarters through the pillar like stems of the fir-trees , to the place where she stood calling them , without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 35]: The noise she made herself , however , prevented her from hearing either their howls or the soft pattering of their many trampling feet as they bounded over the fallen fir needles and cones .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 53]: One huge old wolf had outsped the rest -- not that he could run faster , but that from experience he could more exactly judge whence the cries came , and as he shot through the wood , she caught sight at last of his lamping eyes coming swiftly nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 4]: Terror silenced her .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 41]: She stood with her mouth open , as if she were going to eat the wolf , but she had no breath to scream with , and her tongue curled up in her mouth like a withered and frozen leaf .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 11]: She could do nothing but stare at the coming monster .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 68]: And now he was taking a few shorter bounds , measuring the distance for the one final leap that should bring him upon her , when out stepped the wise woman from behind the very tree by which she had set the princess down , caught the wolf by the throat half-way in his last spring , shook him once , and threw him from her dead .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 25]: Then she turned towards the princess , who flung herself into her arms , and was instantly lapped in the folds of her cloak .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 32]: But now the huge army of wolves and hyenas had rushed like a sea around them , whose waves leaped with hoarse roar and hollow yell up against the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 17]: But she , like a strong stately vessel , moved unhurt through the midst of them .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 18]: Ever as they leaped against her cloak , they dropped and slunk away back through the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 16]: Others ever succeeded , and ever in their turn fell , and drew back confounded .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 17]: For some time she walked on attended and assailed on all sides by the howling pack .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 15]: Suddenly they turned and swept away , vanishing in the depths of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 15]: She neither slackened nor hastened her step , but went walking on as before .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 16]: In a little while she unfolded her cloak , and let the princess look out .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 34]: The firs had ceased ; and they were on a lofty height of moorland , stony and bare and dry , with tufts of heather and a few small plants here and there .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 43]: About the heath , on every side , lay the forest , looking in the moonlight like a cloud ; and above the forest , like the shaven crown of a monk , rose the bare moor over which they were walking .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 22]: Presently , a little way in front of them , the princess espied a whitewashed cottage , gleaming in the moon .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 23]: As they came nearer , she saw that the roof was covered with thatch , over which the moss had grown green .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 54]: It was a very simple , humble place , not in the least terrible to look at , and yet , as soon as she saw it , her fear again awoke , and always , as soon as her fear awoke , the trust of the princess fell into a dead sleep .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 100]: Foolish and useless as she might by this time have known it , she once more began kicking and screaming , whereupon , yet once more , the wise woman set her down on the heath , a few yards from the back of the cottage , and saying only , `` No one ever gets into my house who does not knock at the door , and ask to come in , '' disappeared round the corner of the cottage , leaving the princess alone with the moon -- two white faces in the cone of the night .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 2]: III .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 31]: The moon stared at the princess , and the princess stared at the moon ; but the moon had the best of it , and the princess began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 12]: And now the question was between the moon and the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 29]: The princess thought she knew the worst of the moon , and she knew nothing at all about the cottage , therefore she would stay with the moon .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 26]: Strange , was it not , that she should have been so long with the wise woman , and yet know NOTHING about that cottage ?
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 47]: As for the moon , she did not by any means know the worst of her , or even , that , if she were to fall asleep where she could find her , the old witch would certainly do her best to twist her face .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 19]: But she had scarcely sat a moment longer before she was assailed by all sorts of fresh fears .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 63]: First of all , the soft wind blowing gently through the dry stalks of the heather and its thousands of little bells raised a sweet rustling , which the princess took for the hissing of serpents , for you know she had been naughty for so long that she could not in a great many things tell the good from the bad .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 51]: Then nobody could deny that there , all round about the heath , like a ring of darkness , lay the gloomy fir-wood , and the princess knew what it was full of , and every now and then she thought she heard the howling of its wolves and hyenas .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 22]: And who could tell but some of them might break from their covert and sweep like a shadow across the heath ?
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 35]: Indeed , it was not once nor twice that for a moment she was fully persuaded she saw a great beast coming leaping and bounding through the moonlight to have her all to himself .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 35]: She did not know that not a single evil creature dared set foot on that heath , or that , if one should do so , it would that instant wither up and cease .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 29]: If an army of them had rushed to invade it , it would have melted away on the edge of it , and ceased like a dying wave .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 28]: -- She even imagined that the moon was slowly coming nearer and nearer down the sky to take her and freeze her to death in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 24]: The wise woman , too , she felt sure , although her cottage looked asleep , was watching her at some little window .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 34]: In this , however , she would have been quite right , if she had only imagined enough -- namely , that the wise woman was watching OVER her from the little window .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 61]: But after all , somehow , the thought of the wise woman was less frightful than that of any of her other terrors , and at length she began to wonder whether it might not turn out that she was no ogress , but only a rude , ill-bred , tyrannical , yet on the whole not altogether ill-meaning person .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 63]: Hardly had the possibility arisen in her mind , before she was on her feet : if the woman was any thing short of an ogress , her cottage must be better than that horrible loneliness , with nothing in all the world but a stare ; and even an ogress had at least the shape and look of a human being .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 13]: She darted round the end of the cottage to find the front .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 21]: But , to her surprise , she came only to another back , for no door was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 11]: She tried the farther end , but still no door .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 24]: She must have passed it as she ran -- but no -- neither in gable nor in side was any to be found .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 6]: A cottage without a door !
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 17]: -- she rushed at it in a rage and kicked at the wall with her feet .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 18]: But the wall was hard as iron , and hurt her sadly through her gay silken slippers .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 27]: She threw herself on the heath , which came up to the walls of the cottage on every side , and roared and screamed with rage .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 39]: Suddenly , however , she remembered how her screaming had brought the horde of wolves and hyenas about her in the forest , and , ceasing at once , lay still , gazing yet again at the moon .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 14]: And then came the thought of her parents in the palace at home .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 39]: In her mind 's eye she saw her mother sitting at her embroidery with the tears dropping upon it , and her father staring into the fire as if he were looking for her in its glowing caverns .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 104]: It is true that if they had both been in tears by her side because of her naughtiness , she would not have cared a straw ; but now her own forlorn condition somehow helped her to understand their grief at having lost her , and not only a great longing to be back in her comfortable home , but a feeble flutter of genuine love for her parents awoke in her heart as well , and she burst into real tears -- soft , mournful tears -- very different from those of rage and disappointment to which she was so much used .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 29]: And another very remarkable thing was that the moment she began to love her father and mother , she began to wish to see the wise woman again .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 57]: The idea of her being an ogress vanished utterly , and she thought of her only as one to take her in from the moon , and the loneliness , and the terrors of the forest-haunted heath , and hide her in a cottage with not even a door for the horrid wolves to howl against .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 45]: But the old woman -- as the princess called her , not knowing that her real name was the Wise Woman -- had told her that she must knock at the door : how was she to do that when there was no door ?
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 76]: But again she bethought herself -- that , if she could not do all she was told , she could , at least , do a part of it : if she could not knock at the door , she could at least knock -- say on the wall , for there was nothing else to knock upon -- and perhaps the old woman would hear her , and lift her in by some window .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 25]: Thereupon , she rose at once to her feet , and picking up a stone , began to knock on the wall with it .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 19]: A loud noise was the result , and she found she was knocking on the very door itself .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 29]: For a moment she feared the old woman would be offended , but the next , there came a voice , saying , `` Who is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 20]: The princess answered , `` Please , old woman , I did not mean to knock so loud . ''
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 7]: To this there came no reply .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 26]: Then the princess knocked again , this time with her knuckles , and the voice came again , saying , `` Who is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 9]: And the princess answered , `` Rosamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 8]: Then a second time there was silence .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 11]: But the princess soon ventured to knock a third time .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 7]: `` What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 4]: said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 10]: `` Oh , please , let me in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 4]: said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 19]: `` The moon will keep staring at me ; and I hear the wolves in the wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 10]: Then the door opened , and the princess entered .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 13]: She looked all around , but saw nothing of the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 46]: It was a single bare little room , with a white deal table , and a few old wooden chairs , a fire of fir-wood on the hearth , the smoke of which smelt sweet , and a patch of thick-growing heath in one corner .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 30]: Poor as it was , compared to the grand place Rosamond had left , she felt no little satisfaction as she shut the door , and looked around her .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 75]: And what with the sufferings and terrors she had left outside , the new kind of tears she had shed , the love she had begun to feel for her parents , and the trust she had begun to place in the wise woman , it seemed to her as if her soul had grown larger of a sudden , and she had left the days of her childishness and naughtiness far behind her .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 18]: People are so ready to think themselves changed when it is only their mood that is changed !
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 47]: Those who are good-tempered because it is a fine day , will be ill-tempered when it rains : their selves are just the same both days ; only in the one case , the fine weather has got into them , in the other the rainy .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 116]: Rosamond , as she sat warming herself by the glow of the peat-fire , turning over in her mind all that had passed , and feeling how pleasant the change in her feelings was , began by degrees to think how very good she had grown , and how very good she was to have grown good , and how extremely good she must always have been that she was able to grow so very good as she now felt she had grown ; and she became so absorbed in her self-admiration as never to notice either that the fire was dying , or that a heap of fir-cones lay in a corner near it .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 45]: Suddenly , a great wind came roaring down the chimney , and scattered the ashes about the floor ; a tremendous rain followed , and fell hissing on the embers ; the moon was swallowed up , and there was darkness all about her .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 36]: Then a flash of lightning , followed by a peal of thunder , so terrified the princess , that she cried aloud for the old woman , but there came no answer to her cry .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 35]: Then in her terror the princess grew angry , and saying to herself , `` She must be somewhere in the place , else who was there to open the door to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 27]: began to shout and yell , and call the wise woman all the bad names she had been in the habit of throwing at her nurses .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 10]: But there came not a single sound in reply .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 25]: Strange to say , the princess never thought of telling herself now how naughty she was , though that would surely have been reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 29]: On the contrary , she thought she had a perfect right to be angry , for was she not most desperately ill used -- and a princess too ?
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 49]: But the wind howled on , and the rain kept pouring down the chimney , and every now and then the lightning burst out , and the thunder rushed after it , as if the great lumbering sound could ever think to catch up with the swift light !
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 38]: At length the princess had again grown so angry , frightened , and miserable , all together , that she jumped up and hurried about the cottage with outstretched arms , trying to find the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 67]: But being in a bad temper always makes people stupid , and presently she struck her forehead such a blow against something -- she thought herself it felt like the old woman 's cloak -- that she fell back -- not on the floor , though , but on the patch of heather , which felt as soft and pleasant as any bed in the palace .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 15]: There , worn out with weeping and rage , she soon fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 58]: She dreamed that she was the old cold woman up in the sky , with no home and no friends , and no nothing at all , not even a pocket ; wandering , wandering forever , over a desert of blue sand , never to get to anywhere , and never to lie down or die .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 43]: It was no use stopping to look about her , for what had she to do but forever look about her as she went on and on and on -- never seeing any thing , and never expecting to see any thing !
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 35]: The only shadow of a hope she had was , that she might by slow degrees grow thinner and thinner , until at last she wore away to nothing at all ; only alas !
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 16]: she could not detect the least sign that she had yet begun to grow thinner .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 14]: The hopelessness grew at length so unendurable that she woke with a start .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 27]: Seeing the face of the wise woman bending over her , she threw her arms around her neck and held up her mouth to be kissed .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 14]: And the kiss of the wise woman was like the rose-gardens of Damascus .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 2]: IV .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 20]: The wise woman lifted her tenderly , and washed and dressed her far more carefully than even her nurse .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 14]: Then she set her down by the fire , and prepared her breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 33]: The princess was very hungry , and the bread and milk as good as it could be , so that she thought she had never in her life eaten any thing nicer .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 20]: Nevertheless , as soon as she began to have enough , she said to herself , -- `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 6]: I see how it is !
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 8]: The old woman wants to fatten me !
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 11]: That is why she gives me such nice creamy milk .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 15]: She does n't kill me now because she 's going to kill me then !
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 9]: She IS an ogress , after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 30]: Thereupon she laid down her spoon , and would not eat another mouthful -- only followed the basin with longing looks , as the wise woman carried it away .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 39]: When she stopped eating , her hostess knew exactly what she was thinking ; but it was one thing to understand the princess , and quite another to make the princess understand her : that would require time .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 110]: For the present she took no notice , but went about the affairs of the house , sweeping the floor , brushing down the cobwebs , cleaning the hearth , dusting the table and chairs , and watering the bed to keep it fresh and alive -- for she never had more than one guest at a time , and never would allow that guest to go to sleep upon any thing that had no life in it All the time she was thus busied , she spoke not a word to the princess , which , with the princess , went to confirm her notion of her purposes .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 40]: But whatever she might have said would have been only perverted by the princess into yet stronger proof of her evil designs , for a fancy in her own head would outweigh any multitude of facts in another 's .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 21]: She kept staring at the fire , and never looked round to see what the wise woman might be doing .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 21]: By and by she came close up to the back of her chair , and said , `` Rosamond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 34]: But the princess had fallen into one of her sulky moods , and shut herself up with her own ugly Somebody ; so she never looked round or even answered the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 13]: `` Rosamond , '' she repeated , `` I am going out .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 34]: If you are a good girl , that is , if you do as I tell you , I will carry you back to your father and mother the moment I return . ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 9]: The princess did not take the least notice .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 13]: `` Look at me , Rosamond , '' said the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 27]: But Rosamond never moved -- never even shrugged her shoulders -- perhaps because they were already up to her ears , and could go no farther .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 19]: `` I want to help you to do what I tell you , '' said the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 6]: `` Look at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 20]: Still Rosamond was motionless and silent , saying only to herself , `` I know what she 's after !
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 9]: She wants to show me her horrid teeth .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 6]: But I wo n't look .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 16]: I 'm not going to be frightened out of my senses to please her . ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 8]: `` You had better look , Rosamond .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 11]: Have you forgotten how you kissed me this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 29]: But Rosamond now regarded that little throb of affection as a momentary weakness into which the deceitful ogress had betrayed her , and almost despised herself for it .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 16]: She was one of those who the more they are coaxed are the more disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 35]: For such , the wise woman had an awful punishment , but she remembered that the princess had been very ill brought up , and therefore wished to try her with all gentleness first .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 16]: She stood silent for a moment , to see what effect her words might have .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 18]: But Rosamond only said to herself , -- `` She wants to fatten and eat me . ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 30]: And it was such a little while since she had looked into the wise woman 's loving eyes , thrown her arms round her neck , and kissed her !
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 51]: `` Well , '' said the wise woman gently , after pausing as long as it seemed possible she might bethink herself , `` I must tell you then without ; only whoever listens with her back turned , listens but half , and gets but half the help . ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 12]: `` She wants to fatten me , '' said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 12]: `` You must keep the cottage tidy while I am out .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 56]: When I come back , I must see the fire bright , the hearth swept , and the kettle boiling ; no dust on the table or chairs , the windows clear , the floor clean , and the heather in blossom -- which last comes of sprinkling it with water three times a day .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 23]: When you are hungry , put your hand into that hole in the wall , and you will find a meal . ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 12]: `` She wants to fatten me , '' said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 27]: `` But on no account leave the house till I come back , '' continued the wise woman , `` or you will grievously repent it .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 11]: Remember what you have already gone through to reach it .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 31]: Dangers lie all around this cottage of mine ; but inside , it is the safest place -- in fact the only quite safe place in all the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 24]: `` She means to eat me , '' said the princess , `` and therefore wants to frighten me from running away . ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 7]: She heard the voice no more .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 18]: Then , suddenly startled at the thought of being alone , she looked hastily over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 10]: The cottage was indeed empty of all visible life .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 18]: It was soundless , too : there was not even a ticking clock or a flapping flame .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 25]: The fire burned still and smouldering-wise ; but it was all the company she had , and she turned again to stare into it .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 12]: Soon she began to grow weary of having nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 22]: Then she remembered that the old woman , as she called her , had told her to keep the house tidy .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 7]: `` The miserable little pig-sty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 13]: `` Where 's the use of keeping such a hovel clean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 56]: But in truth she would have been glad of the employment , only just because she had been told to do it , she was unwilling ; for there ARE people -- however unlikely it may seem -- who object to doing a thing for no other reason than that it is required of them .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 26]: `` I am a princess , '' she said , `` and it is very improper to ask me to do such a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 27]: She might have judged it quite as suitable for a princess to sweep away the dust as to sit the centre of a world of dirt .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 10]: But just because she ought , she would n't .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 41]: Perhaps she feared that if she gave in to doing her duty once , she might have to do it always -- which was true enough -- for that was the very thing for which she had been specially born .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 37]: Unable , however , to feel quite comfortable in the resolve to neglect it , she said to herself , `` I 'm sure there 's time enough for such a nasty job as that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 29]: and sat on , watching the fire as it burned away , the glowing red casting off white flakes , and sinking lower and lower on the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 30]: By and by , merely for want of something to do , she would see what the old woman had left for her in the hole of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 26]: But when she put in her hand she found nothing there , except the dust which she ought by this time to have wiped away .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 61]: Never reflecting that the wise woman had told her she would find food there WHEN SHE WAS HUNGRY , she flew into one of her furies , calling her a cheat , and a thief , and a liar , and an ugly old witch , and an ogress , and I do not know how many wicked names besides .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 17]: She raged until she was quite exhausted , and then fell fast asleep on her chair .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 8]: When she awoke the fire was out .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 60]: By this time she was hungry ; but without looking in the hole , she began again to storm at the wise woman , in which labor she would no doubt have once more exhausted herself , had not something white caught her eye : it was the corner of a napkin hanging from the hole in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 33]: She bounded to it , and there was a dinner for her of something strangely good -- one of her favorite dishes , only better than she had ever tasted it before .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 55]: This might surely have at least changed her mood towards the wise woman ; but she only grumbled to herself that it was as it ought to be , ate up the food , and lay down on the bed , never thinking of fire , or dust , or water for the heather .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 35]: The wind began to moan about the cottage , and grew louder and louder , till a great gust came down the chimney , and again scattered the white ashes all over the place .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 21]: But the princess was by this time fast asleep , and never woke till the wind had sunk to silence .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 41]: One of the consequences , however , of sleeping when one ought to be awake is waking when one ought to be asleep ; and the princess awoke in the black midnight , and found enough to keep her awake .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 25]: For although the wind had fallen , there was a far more terrible howling than that of the wildest wind all about the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 46]: Nor was the howling all ; the air was full of strange cries ; and everywhere she heard the noise of claws scratching against the house , which seemed all doors and windows , so crowded were the sounds , and from so many directions .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 16]: All the night long she lay half swooning , yet listening to the hideous noises .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 10]: But with the first glimmer of morning they ceased .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 15]: Then she said to herself , `` How fortunate it was that I woke !
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 13]: They would have eaten me up if I had been asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 14]: The miserable little wretch actually talked as if she had kept them out !
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 51]: If she had done her work in the day , she would have slept through the terrors of the darkness , and awaked fearless ; whereas now , she had in the storehouse of her heart a whole harvest of agonies , reaped from the dun fields of the night !
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 77]: They were neither wolves nor hyenas which had caused her such dismay , but creatures of the air , more frightful still , which , as soon as the smoke of the burning fir-wood ceased to spread itself abroad , and the sun was a sufficient distance down the sky , and the lone cold woman was out , came flying and howling about the cottage , trying to get in at every door and window .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 102]: Down the chimney they would have got , but that at the heart of the fire there always lay a certain fir-cone , which looked like solid gold red-hot , and which , although it might easily get covered up with ashes , so as to be quite invisible , was continually in a glow fit to kindle all the fir-cones in the world ; this it was which had kept the horrible birds -- some say they have a claw at the tip of every wing-feather -- from tearing the poor naughty princess to pieces , and gobbling her up .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 21]: When she rose and looked about her , she was dismayed to see what a state the cottage was in .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 43]: The fire was out , and the windows were all dim with the wings and claws of the dirty birds , while the bed from which she had just risen was brown and withered , and half its purple bells had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 22]: But she consoled herself that she could set all to rights in a few minutes -- only she must breakfast first .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 25]: And , sure enough , there was a basin of the delicious bread and milk ready for her in the hole of the wall !
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 37]: After she had eaten it , she felt comfortable , and sat for a long time building castles in the air -- till she was actually hungry again , without having done an atom of work .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 13]: She ate again , and was idle again , and ate again .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 23]: Then it grew dark , and she went trembling to bed , for now she remembered the horrors of the last night .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 25]: This time she never slept at all , but spent the long hours in grievous terror , for the noises were worse than before .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 30]: She vowed she would not pass another night in such a hateful haunted old shed for all the ugly women , witches , and ogresses in the wide world .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 14]: In the morning , however , she fell asleep , and slept late .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 18]: Breakfast was of course her first thought , after which she could not avoid that of work .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 18]: It made her very miserable , but she feared the consequences of being found with it undone .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 25]: A few minutes before noon , she actually got up , took her pinafore for a duster , and proceeded to dust the table .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 31]: But the wood-ashes flew about so , that it seemed useless to attempt getting rid of them , and she sat down again to think what was to be done .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 21]: But there is very little indeed to be done when we will not do that which we have to do .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 26]: Her first thought now was to run away at once while the sun was high , and get through the forest before night came on .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 22]: She fancied she could easily go back the way she had come , and get home to her father 's palace .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 22]: But not the most experienced traveller in the world can ever go back the way the wise woman has brought him .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 9]: She got up and went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 4]: It was locked !
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 16]: What could the old woman have meant by telling her not to leave the cottage ?
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 4]: She was indignant .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 14]: The wise woman had meant to make it difficult , but not impossible .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 27]: Before the princess , however , could find the way out , she heard a hand at the door , and darted in terror behind it .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 18]: The wise woman opened it , and , leaving it open , walked straight to the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 20]: Rosamond immediately slid out , ran a little way , and then laid herself down in the long heather .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 2]: V .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 32]: The wise woman walked straight up to the hearth , looked at the fire , looked at the bed , glanced round the room , and went up to the table .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 45]: When she saw the one streak in the thick dust which the princess had left there , a smile , half sad , half pleased , like the sun peeping through a cloud on a rainy day in spring , gleamed over her face .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 23]: She went at once to the door , and called in a loud voice , `` Rosamond , come to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 22]: All the wolves and hyenas , fast asleep in the wood , heard her voice , and shivered in their dreams .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 24]: No wonder then that the princess trembled , and found herself compelled , she could not understand how , to obey the summons .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 37]: She rose , like the guilty thing she felt , forsook of herself the hiding-place she had chosen , and walked slowly back to the cottage she had left full of the signs of her shame .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 20]: When she entered , she saw the wise woman on her knees , building up the fire with fir-cones .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 26]: Already the flame was climbing through the heap in all directions , crackling gently , and sending a sweet aromatic odor through the dusty cottage .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 15]: `` That is my part of the work , '' she said , rising .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 6]: `` Now you do yours .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 78]: But first let me remind you that if you had not put it off , you would have found it not only far easier , but by and by quite pleasant work , much more pleasant than you can imagine now ; nor would you have found the time go wearily : you would neither have slept in the day and let the fire out , nor waked at night and heard the howling of the beast-birds .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 36]: More than all , you would have been glad to see me when I came back ; and would have leaped into my arms instead of standing there , looking so ugly and foolish . ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 44]: As she spoke , suddenly she held up before the princess a tiny mirror , so clear that nobody looking into it could tell what it was made of , or even see it at all -- only the thing reflected in it .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 47]: Rosamond saw a child with dirty fat cheeks , greedy mouth , cowardly eyes -- which , not daring to look forward , seemed trying to hide behind an impertinent nose -- stooping shoulders , tangled hair , tattered clothes , and smears and stains everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 8]: That was what she had made herself .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 92]: And to tell the truth , she was shocked at the sight , and immediately began , in her dirty heart , to lay the blame on the wise woman , because she had taken her away from her nurses and her fine clothes ; while all the time she knew well enough that , close by the heather-bed , was the loveliest little well , just big enough to wash in , the water of which was always springing fresh from the ground , and running away through the wall .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 35]: Beside it lay the whitest of linen towels , with a comb made of mother-of-pearl , and a brush of fir-needles , any one of which she had been far too lazy to use .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 23]: She dashed the glass out of the wise woman 's hand , and there it lay , broken into a thousand pieces !
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 48]: Without a word , the wise woman stooped , and gathered the fragments -- did not leave searching until she had gathered the last atom , and she laid them all carefully , one by one , in the fire , now blazing high on the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 17]: Then she stood up and looked at the princess , who had been watching her sulkily .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 32]: `` Rosamond , '' she said , with a countenance awful in its sternness , `` until you have cleansed this room -- '' `` She calls it a room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 6]: sneered the princess to herself .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 9]: `` You shall have no morsel to eat .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 14]: You may drink of the well , but nothing else you shall have .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 20]: When the work I set you is done , you will find food in the same place as before .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 19]: I am going from home again ; and again I warn you not to leave the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 7]: `` She calls it a house !
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 15]: -- It 's a good thing she 's going out of it anyhow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 42]: said the princess , turning her back for mere rudeness , for she was one who , even if she liked a thing before , would dislike it the moment any person in authority over her desired her to do it .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 11]: When she looked again , the wise woman had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 22]: Thereupon the princess ran at once to the door , and tried to open it ; but open it would not .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 15]: She searched on all sides , but could discover no way of getting out .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 51]: The windows would not open -- at least she could not open them ; and the only outlet seemed the chimney , which she was afraid to try because of the fire , which looked angry , she thought , and shot out green flames when she went near it .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 7]: So she sat down to consider .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 20]: One may well wonder what room for consideration there was -- with all her work lying undone behind her .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 42]: She sat thus , however , considering , as she called it , until hunger began to sting her , when she jumped up and put her hand as usual in the hole of the wall : there was nothing there .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 24]: She fell straight into one of her stupid rages ; but neither her hunger nor the hole in the wall heeded her rage .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 24]: Then , in a burst of self-pity , she fell a-weeping , but neither the hunger nor the hole cared for her tears .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 28]: The darkness began to come on , and her hunger grew and grew , and the terror of the wild noises of the last night invaded her .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 15]: Then she began to feel cold , and saw that the fire was dying .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 12]: She darted to the heap of cones , and fed it .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 12]: It blazed up cheerily , and she was comforted a little .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 27]: Then she thought with herself it would surely be better to give in so far , and do a little work , than die of hunger .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 12]: So catching up a duster , she began upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 9]: The dust flew about and nearly choked her .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 14]: She ran to the well to drink , and was refreshed and encouraged .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 54]: Perceiving now that it was a tedious plan to wipe the dust from the table on to the floor , whence it would have all to be swept up again , she got a wooden platter , wiped the dust into that , carried it to the fire , and threw it in .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 40]: But all the time she was getting more and more hungry and , although she tried the hole again and again , it was only to become more and more certain that work she must if she would eat .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 43]: At length all the furniture was dusted , and she began to sweep the floor , which happily , she thought of sprinkling with water , as from the window she had seen them do to the marble court of the palace .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 15]: That swept , she rushed again to the hole -- but still no food !
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 20]: She was on the verge of another rage , when the thought came that she might have forgotten something .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 26]: To her dismay she found that table and chairs and every thing was again covered with dust -- not so badly as before , however .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 32]: Again she set to work , driven by hunger , and drawn by the hope of eating , and yet again , after a second careful wiping , sought the hole .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 3]: But no !
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 6]: nothing was there for her !
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 5]: What could it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 23]: Her asking this question was a sign of progress : it showed that she expected the wise woman to keep her word .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 30]: Then she bethought her that she had forgotten the household utensils , and the dishes and plates , some of which wanted to be washed as well as dusted .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 11]: Faint with hunger , she set to work yet again .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 21]: One thing made her think of another , until at length she had cleaned every thing she could think of .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 11]: Now surely she must find some food in the hole !
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 26]: When this time also there was nothing , she began once more to abuse the wise woman as false and treacherous ; -- but ah !
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 6]: there was the bed unwatered !
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 5]: That was soon amended .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 5]: -- Still no supper !
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 13]: there was the hearth unswept , and the fire wanted making up !
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 5]: -- Still no supper !
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 6]: What else could there be ?
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 26]: She was at her wits ' end , and in very weariness , not laziness this time , sat down and gazed into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 51]: There , as she gazed , she spied something brilliant , -- shining even , in the midst of the fire : it was the little mirror all whole again ; but little she knew that the dust which she had thrown into the fire had helped to heal it .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 54]: She drew it out carefully , and , looking into it , saw , not indeed the ugly creature she had seen there before , but still a very dirty little animal ; whereupon she hurried to the well , took off her clothes , plunged into it , and washed herself clean .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 36]: Then she brushed and combed her hair , made her clothes as tidy as might be , and ran to the hole in the wall : there was a huge basin of bread and milk !
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 11]: Never had she eaten any thing with half the relish !
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 34]: however , when she had finished , she did not wash the basin , but left it as it was , revealing how entirely all the rest had been done only from hunger .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 16]: Then she threw herself on the heather , and was fast asleep in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 21]: Never an evil bird came near her all that night , nor had she so much as one troubled dream .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 29]: In the morning as she lay awake before getting up , she spied what seemed a door behind the tall eight-day clock that stood silent in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 12]: she thought , `` that must be the way out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 5]: and got up instantly .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 18]: The first thing she did , however , was to go to the hole in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 4]: Nothing was there .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 9]: `` Well , I am hardly used ! ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 4]: she cried aloud .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 22]: `` All that cleaning for the cross old woman yesterday , and this for my trouble , -- nothing for breakfast !
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 7]: Not even a crust of bread !
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 11]: Does Mistress Ogress fancy a princess will bear that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 22]: The poor foolish creature seemed to think that the work of one day ought to serve for the next day too !
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 11]: But that is nowhere the way in the whole universe .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 10]: How could there be a universe in that case ?
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 14]: And even she never dreamed of applying the same rule to her breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 9]: `` How good I was all yesterday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 15]: she said , `` and how hungry and ill used I am to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 21]: But she would NOT be a slave , and do over again to-day what she had done only last night !
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 8]: SHE did n't care about her breakfast !
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 36]: She might have it no doubt if she dusted all the wretched place again , but she was not going to do that -- at least , without seeing first what lay behind the clock !
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 18]: Off she darted , and putting her hand behind the clock found the latch of a door .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 11]: It lifted , and the door opened a little way .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 18]: By squeezing hard , she managed to get behind the clock , and so through the door .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 31]: But how she stared , when instead of the open heath , she found herself on the marble floor of a large and stately room , lighted only from above .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 22]: Its walls were strengthened by pilasters , and in every space between was a large picture , from cornice to floor .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 10]: She did not know what to make of it .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 20]: Surely she had run all round the cottage , and certainly had seen nothing of this size near it !
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 31]: She forgot that she had also run round what she took for a hay-mow , a peat-stack , and several other things which looked of no consequence in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 17]: `` So , then , '' she cried , `` the old woman IS a cheat !
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 40]: I believe she 's an ogress , after all , and lives in a palace -- though she pretends it 's only a cottage , to keep people from suspecting that she eats good little children like me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 39]: Had the princess been tolerably tractable , she would , by this time , have known a good deal about the wise woman 's beautiful house , whereas she had never till now got farther than the porch .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 11]: Neither was she at all in its innermost places now .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 36]: But , king 's daughter as she was , she was not a little daunted when , stepping forward from the recess of the door , she saw what a great lordly hall it was .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 42]: She dared hardly look to the other end , it seemed so far off : so she began to gaze at the things near her , and the pictures first of all , for she had a great liking for pictures .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 7]: One in particular attracted her attention .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 16]: She came back to it several times , and at length stood absorbed in it .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 36]: A blue summer sky , with white fleecy clouds floating beneath it , hung over a hill green to the very top , and alive with streams darting down its sides toward the valley below .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 21]: On the face of the hill strayed a flock of sheep feeding , attended by a shepherd and two dogs .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 24]: A little way apart , a girl stood with bare feet in a brook , building across it a bridge of rough stones .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 12]: The wind was blowing her hair back from her rosy face .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 21]: A lamb was feeding close beside her ; and a sheepdog was trying to reach her hand to lick it .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 13]: `` Oh , how I wish I were that little girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 5]: said the princess aloud .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 19]: `` I wonder how it is that some people are made to be so much happier than others !
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 16]: If I were that little girl , no one would ever call me naughty . ''
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 8]: She gazed and gazed at the picture .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 17]: At length she said to herself , `` I do not believe it is a picture .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 19]: It is the real country , with a real hill , and a real little girl upon it .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 17]: I shall soon see whether this is n't another of the old witch 's cheats ! ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 18]: She went close up to the picture , lifted her foot , and stepped over the frame .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 10]: `` I am free , I am free ! ''
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 12]: she exclaimed ; and she felt the wind upon her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 11]: The sound of a closing door struck on her ear .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 18]: She turned -- and there was a blank wall , without door or window , behind her .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 19]: The hill with the sheep was before her , and she set out at once to reach it .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 45]: Now , if I am asked how this could be , I can only answer , that it was a result of the interaction of things outside and things inside , of the wise woman 's skill , and the silly child 's folly .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 28]: If this does not satisfy my questioner , I can only add , that the wise woman was able to do far more wonderful things than this .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 2]: VI .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 30]: Meantime the wise woman was busy as she always was ; and her business now was with the child of the shepherd and shepherdess , away in the north .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 5]: Her name was Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 15]: Her father and mother were poor , and could not give her many things .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 13]: Rosamond would have utterly despised the rude , simple playthings she had .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 31]: Yet in one respect they were of more value far than hers : the king bought Rosamond 's with his money ; Agnes 's father made hers with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 42]: And while Agnes had but few things -- not seeing many things about her , and not even knowing that there were many things anywhere , she did not wish for many things , and was therefore neither covetous nor avaricious .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 64]: She played with the toys her father made her , and thought them the most wonderful things in the world -- windmills , and little crooks , and water-wheels , and sometimes lambs made all of wool , and dolls made out of the leg-bones of sheep , which her mother dressed for her ; and of such playthings she was never tired .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 99]: Sometimes , however , she preferred playing with stones , which were plentiful , and flowers , which were few , or the brooks that ran down the hill , of which , although they were many , she could only play with one at a time , and that , indeed , troubled her a little -- or live lambs that were not all wool , or the sheep-dogs , which were very friendly with her , and the best of playfellows , as she thought , for she had no human ones to compare them with .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 25]: Neither was she greedy after nice things , but content , as well she might be , with the homely food provided for her .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 27]: Nor was she by nature particularly self-willed or disobedient ; she generally did what her father and mother wished , and believed what they told her .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 91]: But by degrees they had spoiled her ; and this was the way : they were so proud of her that they always repeated every thing she said , and told every thing she did , even when she was present ; and so full of admiration of their child were they , that they wondered and laughed at and praised things in her which in another child would never have struck them as the least remarkable , and some things even which would in another have disgusted them altogether .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 13]: Impertinent and rude things done by THEIR child they thought SO clever !
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 54]: laughing at them as something quite marvellous ; her commonplace speeches were said over again as if they had been the finest poetry ; and the pretty ways which every moderately good child has were extolled as if the result of her excellent taste , and the choice of her judgment and will .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 43]: They would even say sometimes that she ought not to hear her own praises for fear it should make her vain , and then whisper them behind their hands , but so loud that she could not fail to hear every word .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 49]: The consequence was that she soon came to believe -- so soon , that she could not recall the time when she did not believe , as the most absolute fact in the universe , that she was SOMEBODY ; that is , she became most immoderately conceited .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 31]: Now as the least atom of conceit is a thing to be ashamed of , you may fancy what she was like with such a quantity of it inside her !
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 78]: At first it did not show itself outside in any very active form ; but the wise woman had been to the cottage , and had seen her sitting alone , with such a smile of self-satisfaction upon her face as would have been quite startling to her , if she had ever been startled at any thing ; for through that smile she could see lying at the root of it the worm that made it .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 31]: For some smiles are like the ruddiness of certain apples , which is owing to a centipede , or other creeping thing , coiled up at the heart of them .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 40]: Only her worm had a face and shape the very image of her own ; and she looked so simpering , and mawkish , and self-conscious , and silly , that she made the wise woman feel rather sick .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 8]: Not that the child was a fool .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 25]: Had she been , the wise woman would have only pitied and loved her , instead of feeling sick when she looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 38]: She had very fair abilities , and were she once but made humble , would be capable not only of doing a good deal in time , but of beginning at once to grow to no end .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 92]: But , if she were not made humble , her growing would be to a mass of distorted shapes all huddled together ; so that , although the body she now showed might grow up straight and well-shaped and comely to behold , the new body that was growing inside of it , and would come out of it when she died , would be ugly , and crooked this way and that , like an aged hawthorn that has lived hundreds of years exposed upon all sides to salt sea-winds .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 22]: As time went on , this disease of self-conceit went on too , gradually devouring the good that was in her .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 20]: For there is no fault that does not bring its brothers and sisters and cousins to live with it .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 63]: By degrees , from thinking herself so clever , she came to fancy that whatever seemed to her , must of course be the correct judgment , and whatever she wished , the right thing ; and grew so obstinate , that at length her parents feared to thwart her in any thing , knowing well that she would never give in .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 41]: But there are victories far worse than defeats ; and to overcome an angel too gentle to put out all his strength , and ride away in triumph on the back of a devil , is one of the poorest .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 24]: So long as she was left to take her own way and do as she would , she gave her parents little trouble .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 58]: She would play about by herself in the little garden with its few hardy flowers , or amongst the heather where the bees were busy ; or she would wander away amongst the hills , and be nobody knew where , sometimes from morning to night ; nor did her parents venture to find fault with her .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 22]: She never went into rages like the princess , and would have thought Rosamond -- oh , so ugly and vile !
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 11]: if she had seen her in one of her passions .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 33]: But she was no better , for all that , and was quite as ugly in the eyes of the wise woman , who could not only see but read her face .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 22]: What is there to choose between a face distorted to hideousness by anger , and one distorted to silliness by self-complacency ?
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 45]: True , there is more hope of helping the angry child out of her form of selfishness than the conceited child out of hers ; but on the other hand , the conceited child was not so terrible or dangerous as the wrathful one .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 36]: The conceited one , however , was sometimes very angry , and then her anger was more spiteful than the other 's ; and , again , the wrathful one was often very conceited too .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 37]: So that , on the whole , of two very unpleasant creatures , I would say that the king 's daughter would have been the worse , had not the shepherd 's been quite as bad .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 108]: But , as I have said , the wise woman had her eye upon her : she saw that something special must be done , else she would be one of those who kneel to their own shadows till feet grow on their knees ; then go down on their hands till their hands grow into feet ; then lay their faces on the ground till they grow into snouts ; when at last they are a hideous sort of lizards , each of which believes himself the best , wisest , and loveliest being in the world , yea , the very centre of the universe .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 52]: And so they run about forever looking for their own shadows , that they may worship them , and miserable because they can not find them , being themselves too near the ground to have any shadows ; and what becomes of them at last there is but one who knows .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 33]: The wise woman , therefore , one day walked up to the door of the shepherd 's cottage , dressed like a poor woman , and asked for a drink of water .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 19]: The shepherd 's wife looked at her , liked her , and brought her a cup of milk .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 21]: The wise woman took it , for she made it a rule to accept every kindness that was offered her .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 28]: Agnes was not by nature a greedy girl , as I have said ; but self-conceit will go far to generate every other vice under the sun .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 25]: Vanity , which is a form of self-conceit , has repeatedly shown itself as the deepest feeling in the heart of a horrible murderess .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 31]: That morning , at breakfast , her mother had stinted her in milk -- just a little -- that she might have enough to make some milk-porridge for their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 82]: Agnes did not mind it at the time , but when she saw the milk now given to a beggar , as she called the wise woman -- though , surely , one might ask a draught of water , and accept a draught of milk , without being a beggar in any such sense as Agnes 's contemptuous use of the word implied -- a cloud came upon her forehead , and a double vertical wrinkle settled over her nose .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 42]: The wise woman saw it , for all her business was with Agnes though she little knew it , and , rising , went and offered the cup to the child , where she sat with her knitting in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 38]: Agnes looked at it , did not want it , was inclined to refuse it from a beggar , but thinking it would show her consequence to assert her rights , took it and drank it up .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 40]: For whoever is possessed by a devil , judges with the mind of that devil ; and hence Agnes was guilty of such a meanness as many who are themselves capable of something just as bad will consider incredible .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 37]: The wise woman waited till she had finished it -- then , looking into the empty cup , said : `` You might have given me back as much as you had no claim upon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 15]: Agnes turned away and made no answer -- far less from shame than indignation .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 8]: The wise woman looked at the mother .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 40]: `` You should not have offered it to her if you did not mean her to have it , '' said the mother , siding with the devil in her child against the wise woman and her child too .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 17]: Some foolish people think they take another 's part when they take the part he takes .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 25]: The wise woman said nothing , but fixed her eyes upon her , and soon the mother hid her face in her apron weeping .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 31]: Then she turned again to Agnes , who had never looked round but sat with her back to both , and suddenly lapped her in the folds of her cloak .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 12]: When the mother again lifted her eyes , she had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 41]: Never supposing she had carried away her child , but uncomfortable because of what she had said to the poor woman , the mother went to the door , and called after her as she toiled slowly up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 16]: But she never turned her head ; and the mother went back into her cottage .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 22]: The wise woman walked close past the shepherd and his dogs , and through the midst of his flock of sheep .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 14]: The shepherd wondered where she could be going -- right up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 25]: There was something strange about her too , he thought ; and he followed her with his eyes as she went up and up .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 33]: It was near sunset , and as the sun went down , a gray cloud settled on the top of the mountain , which his last rays turned into a rosy gold .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 19]: Straight into this cloud the shepherd saw the woman hold her pace , and in it she vanished .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 11]: He little imagined that his child was under her cloak .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 16]: He went home as usual in the evening , but Agnes had not come in .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 51]: They were accustomed to such an absence now and then , and were not at first frightened ; but when it grew dark and she did not appear , the husband set out with his dogs in one direction , and the wife in another , to seek their child .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 9]: Morning came and they had not found her .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 60]: Then the whole country-side arose to search for the missing Agnes ; but day after day and night after night passed , and nothing was discovered of or concerning her , until at length all gave up the search in despair except the mother , although she was nearly convinced now that the poor woman had carried her off .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 50]: One day she had wandered some distance from her cottage , thinking she might come upon the remains of her daughter at the foot of some cliff , when she came suddenly , instead , upon a disconsolate-looking creature sitting on a stone by the side of a stream .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 52]: Her hair hung in tangles from her head ; her clothes were tattered , and through the rents her skin showed in many places ; her cheeks were white , and worn thin with hunger ; the hollows were dark under her eyes , and they stood out scared and wild .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 27]: When she caught sight of the shepherdess , she jumped to her feet , and would have run away , but fell down in a faint .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 29]: At first sight the mother had taken her for her own child , but now she saw , with a pang of disappointment , that she had mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 32]: Full of compassion , nevertheless , she said to herself : `` If she is not my Agnes , she is as much in need of help as if she were .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 63]: If I can not be good to my own , I will be as good as I can to some other woman 's ; and though I should scorn to be consoled for the loss of one by the presence of another , I yet may find some gladness in rescuing one child from the death which has taken the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 14]: Perhaps her words were not just like these , but her thoughts were .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 11]: She took up the child , and carried her home .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 22]: And this is how Rosamond came to occupy the place of the little girl whom she had envied in the picture .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 2]: VII .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 55]: Notwithstanding the differences between the two girls , which were , indeed , so many that most people would have said they were not in the least alike , they were the same in this , that each cared more for her own fancies and desires than for any thing else in the world .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 80]: But I will tell you another difference : the princess was like several children in one -- such was the variety of her moods ; and in one mood she had no recollection or care about any thing whatever belonging to a previous mood -- not even if it had left her but a moment before , and had been so violent as to make her ready to put her hand in the fire to get what she wanted .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 44]: Plainly she was the mere puppet of her moods , and more than that , any cunning nurse who knew her well enough could call or send away those moods almost as she pleased , like a showman pulling strings behind a show .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 19]: Agnes , on the contrary , seldom changed her mood , but kept that of calm assured self-satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 42]: Father nor mother had ever by wise punishment helped her to gain a victory over herself , and do what she did not like or choose ; and their folly in reasoning with one unreasonable had fixed her in her conceit .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 19]: She would actually nod her head to herself in complacent pride that she had stood out against them .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 38]: This , however , was not so difficult as to justify even the pride of having conquered , seeing she loved them so little , and paid so little attention to the arguments and persuasions they used .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 34]: Neither , when she found herself wrapped in the dark folds of the wise woman 's cloak , did she behave in the least like the princess , for she was not afraid .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 26]: `` She 'll soon set me down , '' she said , too self-important to suppose that any one would dare do her an injury .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 22]: Whether it be a good thing or a bad not to be afraid depends on what the fearlessness is founded upon .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 21]: Some have no fear , because they have no knowledge of the danger : there is nothing fine in that .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 15]: Some are too stupid to be afraid : there is nothing fine in that .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 28]: Some who are not easily frightened would yet turn their backs and run , the moment they were frightened : such never had more courage than fear .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 20]: But the man who will do his work in spite of his fear is a man of true courage .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 48]: The fearlessness of Agnes was only ignorance : she did not know what it was to be hurt ; she had never read a single story of giant , or ogress or wolf ; and her mother had never carried out one of her threats of punishment .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 34]: If the wise woman had but pinched her , she would have shown herself an abject little coward , trembling with fear at every change of motion so long as she carried her .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 18]: Nothing such , however , was in the wise woman 's plan for the curing of her .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 10]: On and on she carried her without a word .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 30]: She knew that if she set her down she would never run after her like the princess , at least not before the evil thing was already upon her .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 21]: On and on she went , never halting , never letting the light look in , or Agnes look out .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 21]: She walked very fast , and got home to her cottage very soon after the princess had gone from it .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 17]: But she did not set Agnes down either in the cottage or in the great hall .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 10]: She had other places , none of them alike .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 27]: The place she had chosen for Agnes was a strange one -- such a one as is to be found nowhere else in the wide world .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 26]: It was a great hollow sphere , made of a substance similar to that of the mirror which Rosamond had broken , but differently compounded .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 9]: That substance no one could see by itself .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 17]: It had neither door , nor window , nor any opening to break its perfect roundness .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 36]: The wise woman carried Agnes into a dark room , there undressed her , took from her hand her knitting-needles , and put her , naked as she was born , into the hollow sphere .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 12]: What sort of a place it was she could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 14]: She could see nothing but a faint cold bluish light all about her .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 17]: She could not feel that any thing supported her , and yet she did not sink .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 13]: She stood for a while , perfectly calm , then sat down .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 12]: Nothing bad could happen to HER -- she was so important !
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 26]: And , indeed , it was but this : she had cared only for Somebody , and now she was going to have only Somebody .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 24]: Her own choice was going to be carried a good deal farther for her than she would have knowingly carried it for herself .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 17]: After sitting a while , she wished she had something to do , but nothing came .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 9]: A little longer , and it grew wearisome .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 18]: She would see whether she could not walk out of the strange luminous dusk that surrounded her .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 16]: Walk she found she could , well enough , but walk out she could not .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 38]: On and on she went , keeping as much in a straight line as she might , but after walking until she was thoroughly tired , she found herself no nearer out of her prison than before .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 33]: She had not , indeed , advanced a single step ; for , in whatever direction she tried to go , the sphere turned round and round , answering her feet accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 37]: Like a squirrel in his cage she but kept placing another spot of the cunningly suspended sphere under her feet , and she would have been still only at its lowest point after walking for ages .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 12]: At length she cried aloud ; but there was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 18]: It grew dreary and drearier -- in her , that is : outside there was no change .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 23]: Nothing was overhead , nothing under foot , nothing on either hand , but the same pale , faint , bluish glimmer .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 23]: She wept at last , then grew very angry , and then sullen ; but nobody heeded whether she cried or laughed .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 14]: It was all the same to the cold unmoving twilight that rounded her .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 15]: On and on went the dreary hours -- or did they go at all ?
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 33]: -- `` no change , no pause , no hope ; '' -- on and on till she FELT she was forgotten , and then she grew strangely still and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 59]: The moment she was asleep , the wise woman came , lifted her out , and laid her in her bosom ; fed her with a wonderful milk , which she received without knowing it ; nursed her all the night long , and , just ere she woke , laid her back in the blue sphere again .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 24]: When first she came to herself , she thought the horrors of the preceding day had been all a dream of the night .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 13]: But they soon asserted themselves as facts , for here they were !
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 18]: -- nothing to see but a cold blue light , and nothing to do but see it .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 9]: Oh , how slowly the hours went by !
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 7]: She lost all notion of time .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 42]: If she had been told that she had been there twenty years , she would have believed it -- or twenty minutes -- it would have been all the same : except for weariness , time was for her no more .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 20]: Another night came , and another still , during both of which the wise woman nursed and fed her .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 19]: But she knew nothing of that , and the same one dreary day seemed ever brooding over her .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 21]: All at once , on the third day , she was aware that a naked child was seated beside her .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 12]: But there was something about the child that made her shudder .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 25]: She never looked at Agnes , but sat with her chin sunk on her chest , and her eyes staring at her own toes .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 24]: She was the color of pale earth , with a pinched nose , and a mere slit in her face for a mouth .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 7]: `` How ugly she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 3]: thought Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 9]: `` What business has she beside me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 26]: But it was so lonely that she would have been glad to play with a serpent , and put out her hand to touch her .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 4]: She touched nothing .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 18]: The child , also , put out her hand -- but in the direction away from Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 17]: And that was well , for if she had touched Agnes it would have killed her .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 10]: Then Agnes said , `` Who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 12]: And the little girl said , `` Who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 21]: `` I am Agnes , '' said Agnes ; and the little girl said , `` I am Agnes . ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 29]: Then Agnes thought she was mocking her , and said , `` You are ugly ; '' and the little girl said , `` You are ugly . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 20]: Then Agnes lost her temper , and put out her hands to seize the little girl ; but lo !
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 16]: the little girl was gone , and she found herself tugging at her own hair .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 12]: She let go ; and there was the little girl again !
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 13]: Agnes was furious now , and flew at her to bite her .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 35]: But she found her teeth in her own arm , and the little girl was gone -- only to return again ; and each time she came back she was tenfold uglier than before .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 10]: And now Agnes hated her with her whole heart .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 52]: The moment she hated her , it flashed upon her with a sickening disgust that the child was not another , but her Self , her Somebody , and that she was now shut up with her for ever and ever -- no more for one moment ever to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 13]: In her agony of despair , sleep descended , and she slept .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 22]: When she woke , there was the little girl , heedless , ugly , miserable , staring at her own toes .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 27]: All at once , the creature began to smile , but with such an odious , self-satisfied expression , that Agnes felt ashamed of seeing her .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 26]: Then she began to pat her own cheeks , to stroke her own body , and examine her finger-ends , nodding her head with satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 47]: Agnes felt that there could not be such another hateful , ape-like creature , and at the same time was perfectly aware she was only doing outside of her what she herself had been doing , as long as she could remember , inside of her .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 26]: She turned sick at herself , and would gladly have been put out of existence , but for three days the odious companionship went on .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 40]: By the third day , Agnes was not merely sick but ashamed of the life she had hitherto led , was despicable in her own eyes , and astonished that she had never seen the truth concerning herself before .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 30]: The next morning she woke in the arms of the wise woman ; the horror had vanished from her sight , and two heavenly eyes were gazing upon her .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 25]: She wept and clung to her , and the more she clung , the more tenderly did the great strong arms close around her .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 40]: When she had lain thus for a while , the wise woman carried her into her cottage , and washed her in the little well ; then dressed her in clean garments , and gave her bread and milk .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 29]: When she had eaten it , she called her to her , and said very solemnly , -- `` Agnes , you must not imagine you are cured .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 19]: That you are ashamed of yourself now is no sign that the cause for such shame has ceased .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 29]: In new circumstances , especially after you have done well for a while , you will be in danger of thinking just as much of yourself as before .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 5]: So beware of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 15]: I am going from home , and leave you in charge of the house .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 11]: Do just as I tell you till my return . ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 53]: She then gave her the same directions she had formerly given Rosamond -- with this difference , that she told her to go into the picture-hall when she pleased , showing her the entrance , against which the clock no longer stood -- and went away , closing the door behind her .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 2]: VIII .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 47]: As soon as she was left alone , Agnes set to work tidying and dusting the cottage , made up the fire , watered the bed , and cleaned the inside of the windows : the wise woman herself always kept the outside of them clean .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 31]: When she had done , she found her dinner -- of the same sort she was used to at home , but better -- in the hole of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 14]: When she had eaten it , she went to look at the pictures .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 12]: By this time her old disposition had begun to rouse again .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 18]: She had been doing her duty , and had in consequence begun again to think herself Somebody .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 23]: However strange it may well seem , to do one 's duty will make any one conceited who only does it sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 22]: Those who do it always would as soon think of being conceited of eating their dinner as of doing their duty .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 11]: What honest boy would pride himself on not picking pockets ?
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 9]: A thief who was trying to reform would .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 35]: To be conceited of doing one 's duty is then a sign of how little one does it , and how little one sees what a contemptible thing it is not to do it .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 13]: Could any but a low creature be conceited of not being contemptible ?
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 15]: Until our duty becomes to us common as breathing , we are poor creatures .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 29]: So Agnes began to stroke herself once more , forgetting her late self-stroking companion , and never reflecting that she was now doing what she had then abhorred .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 10]: And in this mood she went into the picture-gallery .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 37]: The first picture she saw represented a square in a great city , one side of which was occupied by a splendid marble palace , with great flights of broad steps leading up to the door .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 78]: Between it and the square was a marble-paved court , with gates of brass , at which stood sentries in gorgeous uniforms , and to which was affixed the following proclamation in letters of gold , large enough for Agnes to read : -- `` By the will of the King , from this time until further notice , every stray child found in the realm shall be brought without a moment 's delay to the palace .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 21]: Whoever shall be found having done otherwise shall straightway lose his head by the hand of the public executioner . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 11]: Agnes 's heart beat loud , and her face flushed .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 12]: `` Can there be such a city in the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 18]: `` If I only knew where it was , I should set out for it at once .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 13]: THERE would be the place for a clever girl like me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 12]: Her eyes fell on the picture which had so enticed Rosamond .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 12]: It was the very country where her father fed his flocks .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 29]: Just round the shoulder of the hill was the cottage where her parents lived , where she was born and whence she had been carried by the beggar-woman .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 11]: she said , `` they did n't know me there .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 14]: They little thought what I could be , if I had the chance .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 30]: If I were but in this good , kind , loving , generous king 's palace , I should soon be such a great lady as they never saw !
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 14]: Then they would understand what a good little girl I had always been !
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 15]: And I should n't forget my poor parents like some I have read of .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 7]: _ I _ would be generous .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 15]: _ I _ should never be selfish and proud like girls in story-books ! ''
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 49]: As she said this , she turned her back with disdain upon the picture of her home , and setting herself before the picture of the palace , stared at it with wide ambitious eyes , and a heart whose every beat was a throb of arrogant self-esteem .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 13]: The shepherd-child was now worse than ever the poor princess had been .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 41]: For the wise woman had given her a terrible lesson one of which the princess was not capable , and she had known what it meant ; yet here she was as bad as ever , therefore worse than before .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 25]: The ugly creature whose presence had made her so miserable had indeed crept out of sight and mind too -- but where was she ?
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 23]: Nestling in her very heart , where most of all she had her company , and least of all could see her .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 42]: The wise woman had called her out , that Agnes might see what sort of creature she was herself ; but now she was snug in her soul 's bed again , and sue did not even suspect she was there .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 36]: After gazing a while at the palace picture , during which her ambitious pride rose and rose , she turned yet again in condescending mood , and honored the home picture with one stare more .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 16]: `` What a poor , miserable spot it is compared with this lordly palace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 17]: But presently she spied something in it she had not seen before , and drew nearer .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 20]: It was the form of a little girl , building a bridge of stones over one of the hill-brooks .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 9]: `` Ah , there I am myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 10]: `` That is just how I used to do .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 13]: -- No , '' she resumed , `` it is not me .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 11]: That snub-nosed little fright could never be meant for me !
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 10]: It was the frock that made me think so .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 9]: But it IS a picture of the place .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 17]: I declare , I can see the smoke of the cottage rising from behind the hill !
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 11]: What a dull , dirty , insignificant spot it is !
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 9]: And what a life to lead there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 9]: She turned once more to the city picture .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 8]: And now a strange thing took place .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 34]: In proportion as the other , to the eyes of her mind , receded into the background , this , to her present bodily eyes , appeared to come forward and assume reality .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 37]: At last , after it had been in this way growing upon her for some time , she gave a cry of conviction , and said aloud , -- `` I do believe it is real !
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 25]: That frame is only a trick of the woman to make me fancy it a picture lest I should go and make my fortune .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 10]: She is a witch , the ugly old creature !
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 33]: It would serve her right to tell the king and have her punished for not taking me to the palace -- one of his poor lost children he is so fond of !
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 12]: I should like to see her ugly old head cut off .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 11]: Anyhow I will try my luck without asking her leave .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 8]: How she has ill used me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 19]: But at that moment , she heard the voice of the wise woman calling , `` Agnes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 23]: and , smoothing her face , she tried to look as good as she could , and walked back into the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 17]: There stood the wise woman , looking all round the place , and examining her work .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 31]: She fixed her eyes upon Agnes in a way that confused her , and made her cast hers down , for she felt as if she were reading her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 48]: The wise woman , however , asked no questions , but began to talk about her work , approving of some of it , which filled her with arrogance , and showing how some of it might have been done better , which filled her with resentment .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 24]: But the wise woman seemed to take no care of what she might be thinking , and went straight on with her lesson .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 53]: By the time it was over , the power of reading thoughts would not have been necessary to a knowledge of what was in the mind of Agnes , for it had all come to the surface -- that is up into her face , which is the surface of the mind .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 39]: Ere it had time to sink down again , the wise woman caught up the little mirror , and held it before her : Agnes saw her Somebody -- the very embodiment of miserable conceit and ugly ill-temper .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 65]: She gave such a scream of horror that the wise woman pitied her , and laying aside the mirror , took her upon her knees , and talked to her most kindly and solemnly ; in particular about the necessity of destroying the ugly things that come out of the heart -- so ugly that they make the very face over them ugly also .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 16]: And what was Agnes doing all the time the wise woman was talking to her ?
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 5]: Would you believe it ?
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 63]: -- instead of thinking how to kill the ugly things in her heart , she was with all her might resolving to be more careful of her face , that is , to keep down the things in her heart so that they should not show in her face , she was resolving to be a hypocrite as well as a self-worshipper .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 16]: Her heart was wormy , and the worms were eating very fast at it now .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 27]: Then the wise woman laid her gently down upon the heather-bed , and she fell fast asleep , and had an awful dream about her Somebody .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 27]: When she woke in the morning , instead of getting up to do the work of the house , she lay thinking -- to evil purpose .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 51]: In place of taking her dream as a warning , and thinking over what the wise woman had said the night before , she communed with herself in this fashion : -- `` If I stay here longer , I shall be miserable , It is nothing better than slavery .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 20]: The old witch shows me horrible things in the day to set me dreaming horrible things in the night .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 28]: If I do n't run away , that frightful blue prison and the disgusting girl will come back , and I shall go out of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 16]: How I do wish I could find the way to the good king 's palace !
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 26]: I shall go and look at the picture again -- if it be a picture -- as soon as I 've got my clothes on .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 5]: The work can wait .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 6]: It 's not my work .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 16]: It 's the old witch 's ; and she ought to do it herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 12]: She jumped out of bed , and hurried on her clothes .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 16]: There was no wise woman to be seen ; and she hastened into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 24]: There was the picture , with the marble palace , and the proclamation shining in letters of gold upon its gates of brass .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 57]: She stood before it , and gazed and gazed ; and all the time it kept growing upon her in some strange way , until at last she was fully persuaded that it was no picture , but a real city , square , and marble palace , seen through a framed opening in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 33]: She ran up to the frame , stepped over it , felt the wind blow upon her cheek , heard the sound of a closing door behind her , and was free .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 10]: FREE was she , with that creature inside her ?
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 18]: The same moment a terrible storm of thunder and lightning , wind and rain , came on .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 5]: The uproar was appalling .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 22]: Agnes threw herself upon the ground , hid her face in her hands , and there lay until it was over .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 14]: As soon as she felt the sun shining on her , she rose .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 10]: There was the city far away on the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 35]: Without once turning to take a farewell look of the place she was leaving , she set off , as fast as her feet would carry her , in the direction of the city .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 25]: So eager was she , that again and again she fell , but only to get up , and run on faster than before .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 2]: IX .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 57]: The shepherdess carried Rosamond home , gave her a warm bath in the tub in which she washed her linen , made her some bread-and-milk , and after she had eaten it , put her to bed in Agnes 's crib , where she slept all the rest of that day and all the following night .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 96]: When at last she opened her eyes , it was to see around her a far poorer cottage than the one she had left -- very bare and uncomfortable indeed , she might well have thought ; but she had come through such troubles of late , in the way of hunger and weariness and cold and fear , that she was not altogether in her ordinary mood of fault-finding , and so was able to lie enjoying the thought that at length she was safe , and going to be fed and kept warm .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 25]: The idea of doing any thing in return for shelter and food and clothes , did not , however , even cross her mind .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 23]: But the shepherdess was one of that plentiful number who can be wiser concerning other women 's children than concerning their own .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 56]: Such will often give you very tolerable hints as to how you ought to manage your children , and will find fault neatly enough with the system you are trying to carry out ; but all their wisdom goes off in talking , and there is none left for doing what they have themselves said .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 22]: There is one road talk never finds , and that is the way into the talker 's own hands and feet .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 19]: And such never seem to know themselves -- not even when they are reading about themselves in print .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 29]: Still , not being specially blinded in any direction but their own , they can sometimes even act with a little sense towards children who are not theirs .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 21]: They are affected with a sort of blindness like that which renders some people incapable of seeing , except sideways .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 19]: She came up to the bed , looked at the princess , and saw that she was better .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 8]: But she did not like her much .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 21]: There was no mark of a princess about her , and never had been since she began to run alone .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 30]: True , hunger had brought down her fat cheeks , but it had not turned down her impudent nose , or driven the sullenness and greed from her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 22]: Nothing but the wise woman could do that -- and not even she , without the aid of the princess herself .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 55]: So the shepherdess thought what a poor substitute she had got for her own lovely Agnes -- who was in fact equally repulsive , only in a way to which she had got used ; for the selfishness in her love had blinded her to the thin pinched nose and the mean self-satisfied mouth .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 40]: It was well for the princess , though , sad as it is to say , that the shepherdess did not take to her , for then she would most likely have only done her harm instead of good .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 20]: `` Now , my girl , '' she said , `` you must get up , and do something .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 9]: We ca n't keep idle folk here . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 18]: `` I 'm not a folk , '' said Rosamond ; `` I 'm a princess . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 11]: `` A pretty princess -- with a nose like that !
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 6]: And all in rags too !
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 19]: If you tell such stories , I shall soon let you know what I think of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 25]: Rosamond then understood that the mere calling herself a princess , without having any thing to show for it , was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 25]: She obeyed and rose , for she was hungry ; but she had to sweep the floor ere she had any thing to eat .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 14]: The shepherd came in to breakfast , and was kinder than his wife .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 36]: He took her up in his arms and would have kissed her ; but she took it as an insult from a man whose hands smelt of tar , and kicked and screamed with rage .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 17]: The poor man , finding he had made a mistake , set her down at once .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 27]: But to look at the two , one might well have judged it condescension rather than rudeness in such a man to kiss such a child .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 34]: He was tall , and almost stately , with a thoughtful forehead , bright eyes , eagle nose , and gentle mouth ; while the princess was such as I have described her .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 39]: Not content with being set down and let alone , she continued to storm and scold at the shepherd , crying she was a princess , and would like to know what right he had to touch her !
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 37]: But he only looked down upon her from the height of his tall person with a benignant smile , regarding her as a spoiled little ape whose mother had flattered her by calling her a princess .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 12]: `` Turn her out of doors , the ungrateful hussy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 4]: cried his wife .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 21]: `` With your bread and your milk inside her ugly body , this is what she gives you for it !
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 16]: Troth , I 'm paid for carrying home such an ill-bred tramp in my arms !
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 6]: My own poor angel Agnes !
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 12]: As if that ill-tempered toad were one hair like her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 21]: These words drove the princess beside herself ; for those who are most given to abuse can least endure it .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 44]: With fists and feet and teeth , as was her wont , she rushed at the shepherdess , whose hand was already raised to deal her a sound box on the ear , when a better appointed minister of vengeance suddenly showed himself .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 74]: Bounding in at the cottage-door came one of the sheep-dogs , who was called Prince , and whom I shall not refer to with a WHICH , because he was a very superior animal indeed , even for a sheep-dog , which is the most intelligent of dogs : he flew at the princess , knocked her down , and commenced shaking her so violently as to tear her miserable clothes to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 41]: Used , however , to mouthing little lambs , he took care not to hurt her much , though for her good he left her a blue nip or two by way of letting her imagine what biting might be .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 63]: His master , knowing he would not injure her , thought it better not to call him off , and in half a minute he left her of his own accord , and , casting a glance of indignant rebuke behind him as he went , walked slowly to the hearth , where he laid himself down with his tail toward her .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 32]: She rose , terrified almost to death , and would have crept again into Agnes 's crib for refuge ; but the shepherdess cried -- `` Come , come , princess !
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 12]: I 'll have no skulking to bed in the good daylight .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 11]: Go and clean your master 's Sunday boots there . ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 6]: `` I will not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 10]: screamed the princess , and ran from the house .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 4]: `` Prince ! ''
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 21]: cried the shepherdess , and up jumped the dog , and looked in her face , wagging his bushy tail .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 14]: `` Fetch her back , '' she said , pointing to the door .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 46]: With two or three bounds Prince caught the princess , again threw her down , and taking her by her clothes dragged her back into the cottage , and dropped her at his mistress ' feet , where she lay like a bundle of rags .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 9]: `` Get up , '' said the shepherdess .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 8]: Rosamond got up as pale as death .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 8]: `` Go and clean the boots . ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 8]: `` I do n't know how . ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 5]: `` Go and try .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 12]: There are the brushes , and yonder is the blacking-pot . ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 46]: Instructing her how to black boots , it came into the thought of the shepherdess what a fine thing it would be if she could teach this miserable little wretch , so forsaken and ill-bred , to be a good , well-behaved , respectable child .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 59]: She was hardly the woman to do it , but every thing well meant is a help , and she had the wisdom to beg her husband to place Prince under her orders for a while , and not take him to the hill as usual , that he might help her in getting the princess into order .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 52]: When the husband was gone , and his boots , with the aid of her own finishing touches , at last quite respectably brushed , the shepherdess told the princess that she might go and play for a while , only she must not go out of sight of the cottage-door .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 31]: The princess went right gladly , with the firm intention , however , of getting out of sight by slow degrees , and then at once taking to her heels .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 26]: But no sooner was she over the threshold than the shepherdess said to the dog , `` Watch her ; '' and out shot Prince .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 19]: The moment she saw him , Rosamond threw herself on her face , trembling from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 56]: But the dog had no quarrel with her , and of the violence against which he always felt bound to protest in dog fashion , there was no sign in the prostrate shape before him ; so he poked his nose under her , turned her over , and began licking her face and hands .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 49]: When she saw that he meant to be friendly , her love for animals , which had had no indulgence for a long time now , came wide awake , and in a little while they were romping and rushing about , the best friends in the world .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 30]: Having thus seen one enemy , as she thought , changed to a friend , she began to resume her former plan , and crept cunningly farther and farther .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 16]: At length she came to a little hollow , and instantly rolled down into it .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 19]: Finding then that she was out of sight of the cottage , she ran off at full speed .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 48]: But she had not gone more than a dozen paces , when she heard a growling rush behind her , and the next instant was on the ground , with the dog standing over her , showing his teeth , and flaming at her with his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 21]: She threw her arms round his neck , and immediately he licked her face , and let her get up .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 29]: But the moment she would have moved a step farther from the cottage , there he was it front of her , growling , and showing his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 14]: She saw it was of no use , and went back with him .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 20]: Thus was the princess provided with a dog for a private tutor -- just the right sort for her .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 11]: Presently the shepherdess appeared at the door and called her .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 29]: She would have disregarded the summons , but Prince did his best to let her know that , until she could obey herself , she must obey him .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 20]: So she went into the cottage , and there the shepherdess ordered her to peel the potatoes for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 5]: She sulked and refused .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 22]: Here Prince could do nothing to help his mistress , but she had not to go far to find another ally .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 8]: `` Very well , Miss Princess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 19]: she said ; `` we shall soon see how you like to go without when dinner-time comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 46]: Now the princess had very little foresight , and the idea of future hunger would have moved her little ; but happily , from her game of romps with Prince , she had begun to be hungry already , and so the threat had force .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 11]: She took the knife and began to peel the potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 9]: By slow degrees the princess improved a little .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 52]: A few more outbreaks of passion , and a few more savage attacks from Prince , and she had learned to try to restrain herself when she felt the passion coming on ; while a few dinnerless afternoons entirely opened her eyes to the necessity of working in order to eat .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 11]: Prince was her first , and Hunger her second dog-counsellor .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 15]: But a still better thing was that she soon grew very fond of Prince .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 124]: Towards the gaining of her affections , he had three advantages : first , his nature was inferior to hers ; next , he was a beast ; and last , she was afraid of him ; for so spoiled was she that she could more easily love what was below than what was above her , and a beast , than one of her own kind , and indeed could hardly have ever come to love any thing much that she had not first learned to fear , and the white teeth and flaming eyes of the angry Prince were more terrible to her than any thing had yet been , except those of the wolf , which she had now forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 36]: Then again , he was such a delightful playfellow , that so long as she neither lost her temper , nor went against orders , she might do almost any thing she pleased with him .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 59]: In fact , such was his influence upon her , that she who had scoffed at the wisest woman in the whole world , and derided the wishes of her own father and mother , came at length to regard this dog as a superior being , and to look up to him as well as love him .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 7]: And this was best of all .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 15]: The improvement upon her , in the course of a month , was plain .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 28]: She had quite ceased to go into passions , and had actually begun to take a little interest in her work and try to do it well .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 10]: Still , the change was mostly an outside one .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 9]: I do not mean that she was pretending .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 12]: Indeed she had never been given to pretence of any sort .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 13]: But the change was not in HER , only in her mood .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 36]: A second change of circumstances would have soon brought a second change of behavior ; and , so long as that was possible , she continued the same sort of person she had always been .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 62]: But if she had not gained much , a trifle had been gained for her : a little quietness and order of mind , and hence a somewhat greater possibility of the first idea of right arising in it , whereupon she would begin to see what a wretched creature she was , and must continue until she herself was right .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 26]: Meantime the wise woman had been watching her when she least fancied it , and taking note of the change that was passing upon her .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 78]: Out of the large eyes of a gentle sheep she had been watching her -- a sheep that puzzled the shepherd ; for every now and then she would appear in his flock , and he would catch sight of her two or three times in a day , sometimes for days together , yet he never saw her when he looked for her , and never when he counted the flock into the fold at night .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 23]: He knew she was not one of his ; but where could she come from , and where could she go to ?
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 28]: For there was no other flock within many miles , and he never could get near enough to her to see whether or not she was marked .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 49]: Nor was Prince of the least use to him for the unravelling of the mystery ; for although , as often as he told him to fetch the strange sheep , he went bounding to her at once , it was only to lie down at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 26]: At length , however , the wise woman had made up her mind , and after that the strange sheep no longer troubled the shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 9]: As Rosamond improved , the shepherdess grew kinder .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 19]: She gave her all Agnes 's clothes , and began to treat her much more like a daughter .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 103]: Hence she had a great deal of liberty after the little work required of her was over , and would often spend hours at a time with the shepherd , watching the sheep and the dogs , and learning a little from seeing how Prince , and the others as well , managed their charge -- how they never touched the sheep that did as they were told and turned when they were bid , but jumped on a disobedient flock , and ran along their backs , biting , and barking , and half choking themselves with mouthfuls of their wool .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 20]: Then also she would play with the brooks , and learn their songs , and build bridges over them .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 52]: And sometimes she would be seized with such delight of heart that she would spread out her arms to the wind , and go rushing up the hill till her breath left her , when she would tumble down in the heather , and lie there till it came back again .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 13]: A noticeable change had by this time passed also on her countenance .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 79]: Her coarse shapeless mouth had begun to show a glimmer of lines and curves about it , and the fat had not returned with the roses to her cheeks , so that her eyes looked larger than before ; while , more noteworthy still , the bridge of her nose had grown higher , so that it was less of the impudent , insignificant thing inherited from a certain great-great-great-grandmother , who had little else to leave her .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 41]: For a long time , it had fitted her very well , for it was just like her ; but now there was ground for alteration , and already the granny who gave it her would not have recognized it .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 28]: It was growing a little liker Prince 's ; and Prince 's was a long , perceptive , sagacious nose , -- one that was seldom mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 112]: One day about noon , while the sheep were mostly lying down , and the shepherd , having left them to the care of the dogs , was himself stretched under the shade of a rock a little way apart , and the princess sat knitting , with Prince at her feet , lying in wait for a snap at a great fly , for even he had his follies -- Rosamond saw a poor woman come toiling up the hill , but took little notice of her until she was passing , a few yards off , when she heard her utter the dog 's name in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 20]: Immediately on the summons , Prince started up and followed her -- with hanging head , but gently-wagging tail .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 36]: At first the princess thought he was merely taking observations , and consulting with his nose whether she was respectable or not , but she soon saw that he was following her in meek submission .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 15]: Then she sprung to her feet and cried , `` Prince , Prince ! ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 25]: But Prince only turned his head and gave her an odd look , as if he were trying to smile , and could not .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 21]: Then the princess grew angry , and ran after him , shouting , `` Prince , come here directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 16]: Again Prince turned his head , but this time to growl and show his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 22]: The princess flew into one of her forgotten rages , and picking up a stone , flung it at the woman .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 19]: Prince turned and darted at her , with fury in his eyes , and his white teeth gleaming .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 35]: At the awful sight the princess turned also , and would have fled , but he was upon her in a moment , and threw her to the ground , and there she lay .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 9]: It was evening when she came to herself .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 22]: A cool twilight wind , that somehow seemed to come all the way from the stars , was blowing upon her .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 28]: The poor woman and Prince , the shepherd and his sheep , were all gone , and she was left alone with the wind upon the heather .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 22]: She felt sad , weak , and , perhaps , for the first time in her life , a little ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 46]: The violence of which she had been guilty had vanished from her spirit , and now lay in her memory with the calm morning behind it , while in front the quiet dusky night was now closing in the loud shame betwixt a double peace .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 8]: Between the two her passion looked ugly .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 6]: It pained her to remember .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 9]: She felt it was hateful , and HERS .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 8]: But , alas , Prince was gone !
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 8]: That horrid woman had taken him away !
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 37]: The fury rose again in her heart , and raged -- until it came to her mind how her dear Prince would have flown at her throat if he had seen her in such a passion .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 12]: The memory calmed her , and she rose and went home .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 29]: There , perhaps , she would find Prince , for surely he could never have been such a silly dog as go away altogether with a strange woman !
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 8]: She opened the door and went in .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 18]: Dogs were asleep all about the cottage , it seemed to her , but nowhere was Prince .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 13]: She crept away to her little bed , and cried herself asleep .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 25]: In the morning the shepherd and shepherdess were indeed glad to find she had come home , for they thought she had run away .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 6]: `` Where is Prince ? ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 8]: she cried , the moment she waked .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 12]: `` His mistress has taken him , '' answered the shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 8]: `` Was that woman his mistress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 5]: `` I fancy so .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 13]: He followed her as if he had known her all his life .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 11]: I am very sorry to lose him , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 14]: The poor woman had gone close past the rock where the shepherd lay .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 22]: He saw her coming , and thought of the strange sheep which had been feeding beside him when he lay down .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 7]: `` Who can she be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 33]: he said to himself ; but when he noted how Prince followed her , without even looking up at him as he passed , he remembered how Prince had come to him .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 44]: And this was how : as he lay in bed one fierce winter morning , just about to rise , he heard the voice of a woman call to him through the storm , `` Shepherd , I have brought you a dog .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 5]: Be good to him .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 10]: I will come again and fetch him away . ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 14]: He dressed as quickly as he could , and went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 19]: It was half snowed up , but on the top of the white mound before it stood Prince .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 17]: And now he had gone as mysteriously as he had come , and he felt sad .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 26]: Rosamond was very sorry too , and hence when she saw the looks of the shepherd and shepherdess , she was able to understand them .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 16]: And she tried for a while to behave better to them because of their sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 14]: So the loss of the dog brought them all nearer to each other .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 2]: X .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 15]: After the thunder-storm , Agnes did not meet with a single obstruction or misadventure .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 36]: Everybody was strangely polite , gave her whatever she desired , and answered her questions , but asked none in return , and looked all the time as if her departure would be a relief .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 40]: They were afraid , in fact , from her appearance , lest she should tell them that she was lost , when they would be bound , on pain of public execution , to take her to the palace .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 54]: But no sooner had she entered the city than she saw it would hardly do to present herself as a lost child at the palace-gates ; for how were they to know that she was not an impostor , especially since she really was one , having run away from the wise woman ?
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 24]: So she wandered about looking at every thing until she was tired , and bewildered by the noise and confusion all around her .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 14]: The wearier she got , the more was she pushed in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 47]: Having been used to a whole hill to wander upon , she was very awkward in the crowded streets , and often on the point of being run over by the horses , which seemed to her to be going every way like a frightened flock .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 33]: She spoke to several persons , but no one stopped to answer her ; and at length , her courage giving way , she felt lost indeed , and began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 12]: A soldier saw her , and asked what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 12]: `` I 've nowhere to go to , '' she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 7]: `` Where 's your mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 4]: asked the soldier .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' answered Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 18]: `` I was carried off by an old woman , who then went away and left me .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 15]: I do n't know where she is , or where I am myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 18]: `` Come , '' said the soldier , `` this is a case for his Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 26]: So saying , he took her by the hand , led her to the palace , and begged an audience of the king and queen .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 43]: The porter glanced at Agnes , immediately admitted them , and showed them into a great splendid room , where the king and queen sat every day to review lost children , in the hope of one day thus finding their Rosamond .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 13]: But they were by this time beginning to get tired of it .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 36]: The moment they cast their eyes upon Agnes , the queen threw back her head , threw up her hands , and cried , `` What a miserable , conceited , white-faced little ape ! ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 37]: and the king turned upon the soldier in wrath , and cried , forgetting his own decree , `` What do you mean by bringing such a dirty , vulgar-looking , pert creature into my palace ?
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 30]: The dullest soldier in my army could never for a moment imagine a child like THAT , one hair 's - breadth like the lovely angel we lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 22]: `` I humbly beg your Majesty 's pardon , '' said the soldier , `` but what was I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 18]: There stands your Majesty 's proclamation in gold letters on the brazen gates of the palace . ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 13]: `` I shall have it taken down , '' said the king .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 6]: `` Remove the child . ''
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 14]: `` Please your Majesty , what am I to do with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 8]: `` Take her home with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 15]: `` I have six already , sire , and do not want her . ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 11]: `` Then drop her where you picked her up . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 22]: `` If I do , sire , some one else will find her and bring her back to your Majesties . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 11]: `` That will never do , '' said the king .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 11]: `` I can not bear to look at her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 24]: `` For all her ugliness , '' said the queen , `` she is plainly lost , and so is our Rosamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 19]: `` It may be only a pretence , to get into the palace , '' said the king .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 24]: `` Take her to the head scullion , soldier , '' said the queen , `` and tell her to make her useful .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 20]: If she should find out she has been pretending to be lost , she must let me know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 54]: The soldier was so anxious to get rid of her , that he caught her up in his arms , hurried her from the room , found his way to the scullery , and gave her , trembling with fear , in charge to the head maid , with the queen 's message .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 28]: As it was evident that the queen had no favor for her , the servants did as they pleased with her , and often treated her harshly .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 41]: Not one amongst them liked her , nor was it any wonder , seeing that , with every step she took from the wise woman 's house , she had grown more contemptible , for she had grown more conceited .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 44]: Every civil answer given her , she attributed to the impression she made , not to the desire to get rid of her ; and every kindness , to approbation of her looks and speech , instead of friendliness to a lonely child .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 40]: Hence by this time she was twice as odious as before ; for whoever has had such severe treatment as the wise woman gave her , and is not the better for it , always grows worse than before .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 67]: They drove her about , boxed her ears on the smallest provocation , laid every thing to her charge , called her all manner of contemptuous names , jeered and scoffed at her awkwardnesses , and made her life so miserable that she was in a fair way to forget every thing she had learned , and know nothing but how to clean saucepans and kettles .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 18]: They would not have been so hard upon her , however , but for her irritating behavior .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 27]: She dared not refuse to do as she was told , but she obeyed now with a pursed-up mouth , and now with a contemptuous smile .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 24]: The only thing that sustained her was her constant contriving how to get out of the painful position in which she found herself .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 58]: There is but one true way , however , of getting out of any position we may be in , and that is , to do the work of it so well that we grow fit for a better : I need not say this was not the plan upon which Agnes was cunning enough to fix .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 20]: She had soon learned from the talk around her the reason of the proclamation which had brought her hither .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 10]: `` Was the lost princess so very beautiful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 11]: she said one day to the youngest of her fellow-servants .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 4]: `` Beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 19]: screamed the maid ; `` she was just the ugliest little toad you ever set eyes upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 7]: `` What was she like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 3]: asked Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 42]: `` She was about your size , and quite as ugly , only not in the same way ; for she had red cheeks , and a cocked little nose , and the biggest , ugliest mouth you ever saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 4]: Agnes fell a-thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 13]: `` Is there a picture of her anywhere in the palace ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 6]: `` How should I know ?
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 7]: You can ask a housemaid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 17]: Agnes soon learned that there was one , and contrived to get a peep of it .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 36]: Then she was certain of what she had suspected from the description given of her , namely , that she was the same she had seen in the picture at the wise woman 's house .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 29]: The conclusion followed , that the lost princess must be staying with her father and mother , for assuredly in the picture she wore one of her frocks .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 31]: She went to the head scullion , and with humble manner , but proud heart , begged her to procure for her the favor of a word with the queen .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 7]: `` A likely thing indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 13]: was the answer , accompanied by a resounding box on the ear .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 41]: She tried the head cook next , but with no better success , and so was driven to her meditations again , the result of which was that she began to drop hints that she knew something about the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 16]: This came at length to the queen 's ears , and she sent for her .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 86]: Absorbed in her own selfish ambitions , Agnes never thought of the risk to which she was about to expose her parents , but told the queen that in her wanderings she had caught sight of just such a lovely creature as she described the princess , only dressed like a peasant -- saying , that , if the king would permit her to go and look for her , she had little doubt of bringing her back safe and sound within a few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 49]: But although she spoke the truth , she had such a look of cunning on her pinched face , that the queen could not possibly trust her , but believed that she made the proposal merely to get away , and have money given her for her journey .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 20]: Still there was a chance , and she would not say any thing until she had consulted the king .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 61]: Then they had Agnes up before the lord chancellor , who , after much questioning of her , arrived at last , he thought , at some notion of the part of the country described by her -- that was , if she spoke the truth , which , from her looks and behavior , he also considered entirely doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 31]: Thereupon she was ordered back to the kitchen , and a band of soldiers , under a clever lawyer , sent out to search every foot of the supposed region .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 31]: They were commanded not to return until they brought with them , bound hand and foot , such a shepherd pair as that of which they received a full description .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 9]: And now Agnes was worse off than before .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 44]: For to her other miseries was added the fear of what would befall her when it was discovered that the persons of whom they were in quest , and whom she was certain they must find , were her own father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 106]: By this time the king and queen were so tired of seeing lost children , genuine or pretended -- for they cared for no child any longer than there seemed a chance of its turning out their child -- that with this new hope , which , however poor and vague at first , soon began to grow upon such imaginations as they had , they commanded the proclamation to be taken down from the palace gates , and directed the various sentries to admit no child whatever , lost or found , be the reason or pretence what it might , until further orders .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 8]: `` I 'm sick of children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 14]: said the king to his secretary , as he finished dictating the direction .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 2]: XI .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 39]: After Prince was gone , the princess , by degrees , fell back into some of her bad old ways , from which only the presence of the dog , not her own betterment , had kept her .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 53]: She never grew nearly so selfish again , but she began to let her angry old self lift up its head once more , until by and by she grew so bad that the shepherdess declared she should not stop in the house a day longer , for she was quite unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 34]: `` It is all very well for you , husband , '' she said , `` for you have n't her all day about you , and only see the best of her .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 22]: But if you had her in work instead of play hours , you would like her no better than I do .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 31]: And then it 's not her ugly passions only , but when she 's in one of her tantrums , it 's impossible to get any work out of her .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 42]: At such times she 's just as obstinate as -- as -- as '' -- She was going to say `` as Agnes , '' but the feelings of a mother overcame her , and she could not utter the words .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 17]: `` In fact , '' she said instead , `` she makes my life miserable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 51]: The shepherd felt he had no right to tell his wife she must submit to have her life made miserable , and therefore , although he was really much attached to Rosamond , he would not interfere ; and the shepherdess told her she must look out for another place .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 40]: The princess was , however , this much better than before , even in respect of her passions , that they were not quite so bad , and after one was over , she was really ashamed of it .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 27]: But not once , ever since the departure of Prince had she tried to check the rush of the evil temper when it came upon her .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 41]: She hated it when she was out of it , and that was something ; but while she was in it , she went full swing with it wherever the prince of the power of it pleased to carry her .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 69]: Nor was this all : although she might by this time have known well enough that as soon as she was out of it she was certain to be ashamed of it , she would yet justify it to herself with twenty different arguments that looked very good at the time , but would have looked very poor indeed afterwards , if then she had ever remembered them .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 79]: She was not sorry to leave the shepherd 's cottage , for she felt certain of soon finding her way back to her father and mother ; and she would , indeed , have set out long before , but that her foot had somehow got hurt when Prince gave her his last admonition , and she had never since been able for long walks , which she sometimes blamed as the cause of her temper growing worse .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 16]: But if people are good-tempered only when they are comfortable , what thanks have they ?
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 34]: -- Her foot was now much better ; and as soon as the shepherdess had thus spoken , she resolved to set out at once , and work or beg her way home .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 34]: At the moment she was quite unmindful of what she owed the good people , and , indeed , was as yet incapable of understanding a tenth part of her obligation to them .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 30]: So she bade them good by without a tear , and limped her way down the hill , leaving the shepherdess weeping , and the shepherd looking very grave .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 38]: When she reached the valley she followed the course of the stream , knowing only that it would lead her away from the hill where the sheep fed , into richer lands where were farms and cattle .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 65]: Rounding one of the roots of the hill she saw before her a poor woman walking slowly along the road with a burden of heather upon her back , and presently passed her , but had gone only a few paces farther when she heard her calling after her in a kind old voice -- `` Your shoe-tie is loose , my child . ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 31]: But Rosamond was growing tired , for her foot had become painful , and so she was cross , and neither returned answer , nor paid heed to the warning .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 49]: For when we are cross , all our other faults grow busy , and poke up their ugly heads like maggots , and the princess 's old dislike to doing any thing that came to her with the least air of advice about it returned in full force .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 26]: `` My child , '' said the woman again , `` if you do n't fasten your shoe-tie , it will make you fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 35]: `` Mind your own business , '' said Rosamond , without even turning her head , and had not gone more than three steps when she fell flat on her face on the path .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 29]: She tried to get up , but the effort forced from her a scream , for she had sprained the ankle of the foot that was already lame .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 9]: The old woman was by her side instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 9]: `` Where are you hurt , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 12]: she asked , throwing down her burden and kneeling beside her .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 8]: `` Go away , '' screamed Rosamond .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 11]: `` YOU made me fall , you bad woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 19]: The woman made no reply , but began to feel her joints , and soon discovered the sprain .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 60]: Then , in spite of Rosamond 's abuse , and the violent pushes and even kicks she gave her , she took the hurt ankle in her hands , and stroked and pressed it , gently kneading it , as it were , with her thumbs , as if coaxing every particle of the muscles into its right place .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 11]: Nor had she done so long before Rosamond lay still .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 21]: At length she ceased , and said : -- `` Now , my child , you may get up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 18]: `` I ca n't get up , and I 'm not your child , '' cried Rosamond .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 5]: `` Go away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 18]: Without another word the woman left her , took up her burden , and continued her journey .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 38]: In a little while Rosamond tried to get up , and not only succeeded , but found she could walk , and , indeed , presently discovered that her ankle and foot also were now perfectly well .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 40]: `` I was n't much hurt after all , '' she said to herself , nor sent a single grateful thought after the poor woman , whom she speedily passed once more upon the road without even a greeting .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 54]: Late in the afternoon she came to a spot where the path divided into two , and was taking the one she liked the look of better , when she started at the sound of the poor woman 's voice , whom she thought she had left far behind , again calling her .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 18]: She looked round , and there she was , toiling under her load of heather as before .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 11]: `` You are taking the wrong turn , child . ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 8]: `` How can you tell that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 3]: said Rosamond .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 12]: `` You know nothing about where I want to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 21]: `` I know that road will take you where you wo n't want to go , '' said the woman .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 23]: `` I shall know when I get there , then , '' returned Rosamond , `` and no thanks to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 5]: She set off running .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 14]: The woman took the other path , and was soon out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 24]: By and by , Rosamond found herself in the midst of a peat-moss -- a flat , lonely , dismal , black country .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 29]: She thought , however , that the road would soon lead her across to the other side of it among the farms , and went on without anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 34]: But the stream , which had hitherto been her guide , had now vanished ; and when it began to grow dark , Rosamond found that she could no longer distinguish the track .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 21]: She turned , therefore , but only to find that the same darkness covered it behind as well as before .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 27]: Still she made the attempt to go back by keeping as direct a line as she could , for the path was straight as an arrow .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 44]: But she could not see enough even to start her in a line , and she had not gone far before she found herself hemmed in , apparently on every side , by ditches and pools of black , dismal , slimy water .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 28]: And now it was so dark that she could see nothing more than the gleam of a bit of clear sky now and then in the water .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 50]: Again and again she stepped knee-deep in black mud , and once tumbled down in the shallow edge of a terrible pool ; after which she gave up the attempt to escape the meshes of the watery net , stood still , and began to cry bitterly , despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 38]: She saw now that her unreasonable anger had made her foolish as well as rude , and felt that she was justly punished for her wickedness to the poor woman who had been so friendly to her .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 11]: What would Prince think of her , if he knew ?
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 15]: She cast herself on the ground , hungry , and cold , and weary .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 16]: Presently , she thought she saw long creatures come heaving out of the black pools .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 33]: A toad jumped upon her , and she shrieked , and sprang to her feet , and would have run away headlong , when she spied in the distance a faint glimmer .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 10]: She thought it was a Will-o ' - the-wisp .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 6]: What could he be after ?
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 6]: Was he looking for her ?
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 14]: She dared not run , lest he should see and pounce upon her .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 11]: The light came nearer , and grew brighter and larger .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 15]: Plainly , the little fiend was looking for her -- he would torment her .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 28]: After many twistings and turnings among the pools , it came straight towards her , and she would have shrieked , but that terror made her dumb .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 9]: It came nearer and nearer , and lo !
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 31]: it was borne by a dark figure , with a burden on its back : it was the poor woman , and no demon , that was looking for her !
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 19]: She gave a scream of joy , fell down weeping at her feet , and clasped her knees .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 54]: Then the poor woman threw away her burden , laid down her lantern , took the princess up in her arms , folded her cloak around her , and having taken up her lantern again , carried her slowly and carefully through the midst of the black pools , winding hither and thither .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 56]: All night long she carried her thus , slowly and wearily , until at length the darkness grew a little thinner , an uncertain hint of light came from the east , and the poor woman , stopping on the brow of a little hill , opened her cloak , and set the princess down .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 12]: `` I can carry you no farther , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 11]: `` Sit there on the grass till the light comes .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 8]: I will stand here by you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 5]: Rosamond had been asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 28]: Now she rubbed her eyes and looked , but it was too dark to see any thing more than that there was a sky over her head .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 57]: Slowly the light grew , until she could see the form of the poor woman standing in front of her ; and as it went on growing , she began to think she had seen her somewhere before , till all at once she thought of the wise woman , and saw it must be she .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 20]: Then she was so ashamed that she bent down her head , and could look at her no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 28]: But the poor woman spoke , and the voice was that of the wise woman , and every word went deep into the heart of the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 46]: `` Rosamond , '' she said , `` all this time , ever since I carried you from your father 's palace , I have been doing what I could to make you a lovely creature : ask yourself how far I have succeeded . ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 42]: All her past story , since she found herself first under the wise woman 's cloak , arose , and glided past the inner eyes of the princess , and she saw , and in a measure understood , it all .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 15]: But she sat with her eyes on the ground , and made no sign .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 18]: Then said the wise woman : -- `` Below there is the forest which surrounds my house .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 5]: I am going home .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 29]: If you pledge to come there to me , I will help you , in a way I could not do now , to be good and lovely .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 23]: I will wait you there all day , but if you start at once , you may be there long before noon .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 9]: I shall have your breakfast waiting for you .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 40]: One thing more : the beasts have not yet all gone home to their holes ; but I give you my word , not one will touch you so long as you keep coming nearer to my house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 3]: She ceased .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 12]: Rosamond sat waiting to hear something more ; but nothing came .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 8]: She looked up ; she was alone .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 4]: Alone once more !
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 15]: Always being left alone , because she would not yield to what was right !
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 14]: Oh , how safe she had felt under the wise woman 's cloak !
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 24]: She had indeed been good to her , and she had in return behaved like one of the hyenas of the awful wood !
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 10]: What a wonderful house it was she lived in !
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 16]: And again all her own story came up into her brain from her repentant heart .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 11]: `` Why did n't she take me with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 8]: `` I would have gone gladly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 4]: And she wept .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 45]: But her own conscience told her that , in the very middle of her shame and desire to be good , she had returned no answer to the words of the wise woman ; she had sat like a tree-stump , and done nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 39]: She tried to say there was nothing to be done ; but she knew at once that she could have told the wise woman she had been very wicked , and asked her to take her with her .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 8]: Now there was nothing to be done .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 7]: `` Nothing to be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 4]: said her conscience .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 18]: `` Can not you rise , and walk down the hill , and through the wood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 7]: `` But the wild beasts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 5]: `` There it is !
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 9]: You do n't believe the wise woman yet !
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 13]: Did she not tell you the beasts would not touch you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 8]: `` But they are so horrid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 31]: `` Yes , they are ; but it would be far better to be eaten up alive by them than live on -- such a worthless creature as you are .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 18]: Why , you 're not fit to be thought about by any but bad ugly creatures . ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 8]: This was how herself talked to her .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 2]: XII .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 22]: All at once she jumped to her feet , and ran at full speed down the hill and into the wood .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 24]: She heard howlings and yellings on all sides of her , but she ran straight on , as near as she could judge .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 7]: Her spirits rose as she ran .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 40]: Suddenly she saw before her , in the dusk of the thick wood , a group of some dozen wolves and hyenas , standing all together right in her way , with their green eyes fixed upon her staring .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 29]: She faltered one step , then bethought her of what the wise woman had promised , and keeping straight on , dashed right into the middle of them .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 13]: They fled howling , as if she had struck them with fire .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 35]: She was no more afraid after that , and ere the sun was up she was out of the wood and upon the heath , which no bad thing could step upon and live .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 56]: With the first peep of the sun above the horizon , she saw the little cottage before her , and ran as fast as she could run towards it , When she came near it , she saw that the door was open , and ran straight into the outstretched arms of the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 27]: The wise woman kissed her and stroked her hair , set her down by the fire , and gave her a bowl of bread and milk .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 45]: When she had eaten it she drew her before her where she sat , and spoke to her thus : -- `` Rosamond , if you would be a blessed creature instead of a mere wretch , you must submit to be tried . ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 7]: `` Is that something terrible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 7]: asked the princess , turning white .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 18]: `` No , my child ; but it is something very difficult to come well out of .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 71]: Nobody who has not been tried knows how difficult it is ; but whoever has come well out of it , and those who do not overcome never do come out of it , always looks back with horror , not on what she has come through , but on the very idea of the possibility of having failed , and being still the same miserable creature as before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 13]: `` You will tell me what it is before it begins ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 4]: said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 8]: `` I will not tell you exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 11]: But I will tell you some things to help you .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 27]: One great danger is that perhaps you will think you are in it before it has really begun , and say to yourself , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 7]: this is really nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 21]: It may be a trial to some , but for me I am sure it is not worth mentioning . '
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 22]: And then , before you know , it will be upon you , and you will fail utterly and shamefully . ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 14]: `` I will be very , very careful , '' said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 10]: `` Only do n't let me be frightened . ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 14]: `` You shall not be frightened , except it be your own doing .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 19]: You are already a brave girl , and there is no occasion to try you more that way .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 52]: I saw how you rushed into the middle of the ugly creatures ; and as they ran from you , so will all kinds of evil things , as long as you keep them outside of you , and do not open the cottage of your heart to let them in .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 15]: I will tell you something more about what you will have to go through .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 55]: `` Nobody can be a real princess -- do not imagine you have yet been any thing more than a mock one -- until she is a princess over herself , that is , until , when she finds herself unwilling to do the thing that is right , she makes herself do it .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 33]: So long as any mood she is in makes her do the thing she will be sorry for when that mood is over , she is a slave , and no princess .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 26]: A princess is able to do what is right even should she unhappily be in a mood that would make another unable to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 49]: For instance , if you should be cross and angry , you are not a whit the less bound to be just , yes , kind even -- a thing most difficult in such a mood -- though ease itself in a good mood , loving and sweet .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 27]: Whoever does what she is bound to do , be she the dirtiest little girl in the street , is a princess , worshipful , honorable .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 35]: Nay , more ; her might goes farther than she could send it , for if she act so , the evil mood will wither and die , and leave her loving and clean .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 10]: -- Do you understand me , dear Rosamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 21]: As she spoke , the wise woman laid her hand on her head and looked -- oh , so lovingly !
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 5]: -- into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 13]: `` I am not sure , '' said the princess , humbly .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 52]: `` Perhaps you will understand me better if I say it just comes to this , that you must NOT DO what is wrong , however much you are inclined to do it , and you must DO what is right , however much you are disinclined to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 10]: `` I understand that , '' said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 24]: `` I am going , then , to put you in one of the mood-chambers of which I have many in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 17]: Its mood will come upon you , and you will have to deal with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 9]: She rose and took her by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 12]: The princess trembled a little , but never thought of resisting .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 43]: The wise woman led her into the great hall with the pictures , and through a door at the farther end , opening upon another large hall , which was circular , and had doors close to each other all round it .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 18]: Of these she opened one , pushed the princess gently in , and closed it behind her .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 9]: The princess found herself in her old nursery .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 24]: Her little white rabbit came to meet her in a lumping canter as if his back were going to tumble over his head .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 18]: Her nurse , in her rocking-chair by the chimney corner , sat just as she had used .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 28]: The fire burned brightly , and on the table were many of her wonderful toys , on which , however , she now looked with some contempt .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 29]: Her nurse did not seem at all surprised to see her , any more than if the princess had but just gone from the room and returned again .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 12]: how different I am from what I used to be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 14]: thought the princess to herself , looking from her toys to her nurse .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 12]: `` The wise woman has done me so much good already !
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 31]: I will go and see mamma at once , and tell her I am very glad to be at home again , and very sorry I was so naughty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 6]: She went towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 17]: `` Your queen-mamma , princess , can not see you now , '' said her nurse .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 27]: `` I have yet to learn that it is my part to take orders from a servant , '' said the princess with temper and dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 33]: `` I beg your pardon , princess , '' returned her nurse , politely ; `` but it is my duty to tell you that your queen-mamma is at this moment engaged .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 17]: She is alone with her most intimate friend , the Princess of the Frozen Regions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 20]: `` I shall see for myself , '' returned the princess , bridling , and walked to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 43]: Now little bunny , leap-frogging near the door , happened that moment to get about her feet , just as she was going to open it , so that she tripped and fell against it , striking her forehead a good blow .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 26]: She caught up the rabbit in a rage , and , crying , `` It is all your fault , you ugly old wretch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 10]: threw it with violence in her nurse 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 21]: Her nurse caught the rabbit , and held it to her face , as if seeking to sooth its fright .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 29]: But the rabbit looked very limp and odd , and , to her amazement , Rosamond presently saw that the thing was no rabbit , but a pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 44]: The next moment she removed it from her face , and Rosamond beheld -- not her nurse , but the wise woman -- standing on her own hearth , while she herself stood by the door leading from the cottage into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 13]: `` First trial a failure , '' said the wise woman quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 23]: Overcome with shame , Rosamond ran to her , fell down on her knees , and hid her face in her dress .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 8]: `` Need I say any thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 9]: said the wise woman , stroking her hair .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 10]: `` No , no , '' cried the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 6]: `` I am horrid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 21]: `` You know now the kind of thing you have to meet : are you ready to try again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 7]: `` MAY I try again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 7]: cried the princess , jumping up .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 5]: `` I 'm ready .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 11]: I do not think I shall fail this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 8]: `` The trial will be harder . ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 11]: Rosamond drew in her breath , and set her teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 33]: The wise woman looked at her pitifully , but took her by the hand , led her to the round hall , opened the same door , and closed it after her .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 27]: The princess expected to find herself again in the nursery , but in the wise woman 's house no one ever has the same trial twice .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 18]: She was in a beautiful garden , full of blossoming trees and the loveliest roses and lilies .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 14]: A lake was in the middle of it , with a tiny boat .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 33]: So delightful was it that Rosamond forgot all about how or why she had come there , and lost herself in the joy of the flowers and the trees and the water .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 33]: Presently came the shout of a child , merry and glad , and from a clump of tulip trees rushed a lovely little boy , with his arms stretched out to her .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 30]: She was charmed at the sight , ran to meet him , caught him up in her arms , kissed him , and could hardly let him go again .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 29]: But the moment she set him down he ran from her towards the lake , looking back as he ran , and crying `` Come , come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 3]: She followed .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 21]: He made straight for the boat , clambered into it , and held out his hand to help her in .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 36]: Then he caught up the little boat-hook , and pushed away from the shore : there was a great white flower floating a few yards off , and that was the little fellow 's goal .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 28]: no sooner had Rosamond caught sight of it , huge and glowing as a harvest moon , than she felt a great desire to have it herself .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 18]: The boy , however , was in the bows of the boat , and caught it first .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 49]: It had a long stem , reaching down to the bottom of the water , and for a moment he tugged at it in vain , but at last it gave way so suddenly , that he tumbled back with the flower into the bottom of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 44]: Then Rosamond , almost wild at the danger it was in as he struggled to rise , hurried to save it , but somehow between them it came in pieces , and all its petals of fretted silver were scattered about the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 41]: When the boy got up , and saw the ruin his companion had occasioned , he burst into tears , and having the long stalk of the flower still in his hand , struck her with it across the face .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 22]: It did not hurt her much , for he was a very little fellow , but it was wet and slimy .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 28]: She tumbled rather than rushed at him , seized him in her arms , tore him from his frightened grasp , and flung him into the water .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 33]: His head struck on the boat as he fell , and he sank at once to the bottom , where he lay looking up at her with white face and open eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 16]: The moment she saw the consequences of her deed she was filled with horrible dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 26]: She tried hard to reach down to him through the water , but it was far deeper than it looked , and she could not .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 36]: Neither could she get her eyes to leave the white face : its eyes fascinated and fixed hers ; and there she lay leaning over the boat and staring at the death she had made .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 8]: But a voice crying , `` Ally !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 3]: Ally ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 34]: shot to her heart , and springing to her feet she saw a lovely lady come running down the grass to the brink of the water with her hair flying about her head .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 7]: `` Where is my Ally ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 3]: she shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 23]: But Rosamond could not answer , and only stared at the lady , as she had before stared at her drowned boy .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 33]: Then the lady caught sight of the dead thing at the bottom of the water , and rushed in , and , plunging down , struggled and groped until she reached it .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 30]: Then she rose and stood up with the dead body of her little son in her arms , his head hanging back , and the water streaming from him .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 12]: `` See what you have made of him , Rosamond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 24]: she said , holding the body out to her ; `` and this is your second trial , and also a failure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 47]: The dead child melted away from her arms , and there she stood , the wise woman , on her own hearth , while Rosamond found herself beside the little well on the floor of the cottage , with one arm wet up to the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 14]: She threw herself on the heather-bed and wept from relief and vexation both .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 18]: The wise woman walked out of the cottage , shut the door , and left her alone .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 13]: Rosamond was sobbing , so that she did not hear her go .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 29]: When at length she looked up , and saw that the wise woman was gone , her misery returned afresh and tenfold , and she wept and wailed .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 18]: The hours passed , the shadows of evening began to fall , and the wise woman entered .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 2]: XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 22]: She went straight to the bed , and taking Rosamond in her arms , sat down with her by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 6]: `` My poor child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 5]: `` Two terrible failures !
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 6]: And the more the harder !
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 6]: They get stronger and stronger .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 7]: What is to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 8]: `` Could n't you help me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 4]: said Rosamond piteously .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 16]: `` Perhaps I could , now you ask me , '' answered the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 14]: `` When you are ready to try again , we shall see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 13]: `` I am very tired of myself , '' said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 12]: `` But I ca n't rest till I try again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 24]: `` That is the only way to get rid of your weary , shadowy self , and find your strong , true self .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 21]: Come , my child ; I will help you all I can , for now I CAN help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 25]: Yet again she led her to the same door , and seemed to the princess to send her yet again alone into the room .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 14]: She was in a forest , a place half wild , half tended .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 42]: The trees were grand , and full of the loveliest birds , of all glowing gleaming and radiant colors , which , unlike the brilliant birds we know in our world , sang deliciously , every one according to his color .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 36]: The trees were not at all crowded , but their leaves were so thick , and their boughs spread so far , that it was only here and there a sunbeam could get straight through .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 38]: All the gentle creatures of a forest were there , but no creatures that killed , not even a weasel to kill the rabbits , or a beetle to eat the snails out of their striped shells .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 20]: As to the butterflies , words would but wrong them if they tried to tell how gorgeous they were .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 25]: The princess 's delight was so great that she neither laughed nor ran , but walked about with a solemn countenance and stately step .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 8]: `` But where are the flowers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 7]: she said to herself at length .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 4]: They were nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 41]: Neither on the high trees , nor on the few shrubs that grew here and there amongst them , were there any blossoms ; and in the grass that grew everywhere there was not a single flower to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 6]: `` Ah , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 26]: said Rosamond again to herself , `` where all the birds and butterflies are living flowers , we can do without the other sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 19]: Still she could not help feeling that flowers were wanted to make the beauty of the forest complete .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 48]: Suddenly she came out on a little open glade ; and there , on the root of a great oak , sat the loveliest little girl , with her lap full of flowers of all colors , but of such kinds as Rosamond had never before seen .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 32]: She was playing with them -- burying her hands in them , tumbling them about , and every now and then picking one from the rest , and throwing it away .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 47]: All the time she never smiled , except with her eyes , which were as full as they could hold of the laughter of the spirit -- a laughter which in this world is never heard , only sets the eyes alight with a liquid shining .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 58]: Rosamond drew nearer , for the wonderful creature would have drawn a tiger to her side , and tamed him on the way , A few yards from her , she came upon one of her cast-away flowers and stooped to pick it up , as well she might where none grew save in her own longing .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 24]: But to her amazement she found , instead of a flower thrown away to wither , one fast rooted and quite at home .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 26]: She left it , and went to another ; but it also was fast in the soil , and growing comfortably in the warm grass .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 5]: What could it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 28]: One after another she tried , until at length she was satisfied that it was the same with every flower the little girl threw from her lap .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 17]: She watched then until she saw her throw one , and instantly bounded to the spot .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 29]: But the flower had been quicker than she : there it grew , fast fixed in the earth , and , she thought , looked at her roguishly .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 11]: Something evil moved in her , and she plucked it .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 4]: `` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 4]: do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 4]: cried the child .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 11]: `` My flowers can not live in your hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 6]: Rosamond looked at the flower .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 5]: It was withered already .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 8]: She threw it from her , offended .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 36]: The child rose , with difficulty keeping her lapful together , picked it up , carried it back , sat down again , spoke to it , kissed it , sang to it -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 8]: such a sweet , childish little song !
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 16]: -- the princess never could recall a word of it -- and threw it away .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 15]: Up rose its little head , and there it was , busy growing again !
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 52]: Rosamond 's bad temper soon gave way : the beauty and sweetness of the child had overcome it ; and , anxious to make friends with her , she drew near , and said : `` Wo n't you give me a little flower , please , you beautiful child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 26]: `` There they are ; they are all for you , '' answered the child , pointing with her outstretched arm and forefinger all round .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 16]: `` But you told me , a minute ago , not to touch them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 9]: `` Yes , indeed , I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 16]: `` They ca n't be mine , if I 'm not to touch them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 27]: `` If , to call them yours , you must kill them , then they are not yours , and never , never can be yours .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 10]: They are nobody 's when they are dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 9]: `` But you do n't kill them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 12]: `` I do n't pull them ; I throw them away .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 5]: I live them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 11]: `` How is it that you make them grow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 9]: `` I say , ` You darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 10]: and throw it away and there it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 8]: `` Where do you get them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 6]: `` In my lap . ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 12]: `` I wish you would let me throw one away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 9]: `` Have you got any in your lap ?
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 5]: Let me see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 8]: `` No ; I have none . ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 17]: `` Then you ca n't throw one away , if you have n't got one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 7]: `` You are mocking me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 4]: cried the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 27]: `` I am not mocking you , '' said the child , looking her full in the face , with reproach in her large blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 12]: `` Oh , that 's where the flowers come from ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 18]: said the princess to herself , the moment she saw them , hardly knowing what she meant .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 33]: Then the child rose as if hurt , and quickly threw away all the flowers she had in her lap , but one by one , and without any sign of anger .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 31]: When they were all gone , she stood a moment , and then , in a kind of chanting cry , called , two or three times , `` Peggy !
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 2]: Peggy !
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 3]: Peggy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 51]: A low , glad cry , like the whinny of a horse , answered , and , presently , out of the wood on the opposite side of the glade , came gently trotting the loveliest little snow-white pony , with great shining blue wings , half-lifted from his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 18]: Straight towards the little girl , neither hurrying nor lingering , he trotted with light elastic tread .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 16]: Rosamond 's love for animals broke into a perfect passion of delight at the vision .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 55]: She rushed to meet the pony with such haste , that , although clearly the best trained animal under the sun , he started back , plunged , reared , and struck out with his fore-feet ere he had time to observe what sort of a creature it was that had so startled him .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 33]: When he perceived it was a little girl , he dropped instantly upon all fours , and content with avoiding her , resumed his quiet trot in the direction of his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 9]: Rosamond stood gazing after him in miserable disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 44]: When he reached the child , he laid his head on her shoulder , and she put her arm up round his neck ; and after she had talked to him a little , he turned and came trotting back to the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 66]: Almost beside herself with joy , she began caressing him in the rough way which , not-withstanding her love for them , she was in the habit of using with animals ; and she was not gentle enough , in herself even , to see that he did not like it , and was only putting up with it for the sake of his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 73]: But when , that she might jump upon his back , she laid hold of one of his wings , and ruffled some of the blue feathers , he wheeled suddenly about , gave his long tail a sharp whisk which threw her flat on the grass , and , trotting back to his mistress , bent down his head before her as if asking excuse for ridding himself of the unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 5]: The princess was furious .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 38]: She had forgotten all her past life up to the time when she first saw the child : her beauty had made her forget , and yet she was now on the very borders of hating her .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 37]: What she might have done , or rather tried to do , had not Peggy 's tail struck her down with such force that for a moment she could not rise , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 17]: But while she lay half-stunned , her eyes fell on a little flower just under them .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 24]: It stared up in her face like the living thing it was , and she could not take her eyes off its face .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 13]: It was like a primrose trying to express doubt instead of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 20]: It seemed to put her half in mind of something , and she felt as if shame were coming .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 40]: She put out her hand to pluck it ; but the moment her fingers touched it , the flower withered up , and hung as dead on its stalks as if a flame of fire had passed over it .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 45]: Then a shudder thrilled through the heart of the princess , and she thought with herself , saying -- `` What sort of a creature am I that the flowers wither when I touch them , and the ponies despise me with their tails ?
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 12]: What a wretched , coarse , ill-bred creature I must be !
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 23]: There is that lovely child giving life instead of death to the flowers , and a moment ago I was hating her !
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 26]: I am made horrid , and I shall be horrid , and I hate myself , and yet I ca n't help being myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 33]: She heard the sound of galloping feet , and there was the pony , with the child seated betwixt his wings , coming straight on at full speed for where she lay .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 10]: `` I do n't care , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 12]: `` They may trample me under their feet if they like .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 18]: I am tired and sick of myself -- a creature at whose touch the flowers wither ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 6]: On came the winged pony .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 50]: But while yet some distance off , he gave a great bound , spread out his living sails of blue , rose yards and yards above her in the air , and alighted as gently as a bird , just a few feet on the other side of her .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 11]: The child slipped down and came and kneeled over her .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 8]: `` Did my pony hurt you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 7]: `` I am so sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 35]: `` Yes , he hurt me , '' answered the princess , `` but not more than I deserved , for I took liberties with him , and he did not like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 7]: `` Oh , you dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 5]: said the little girl .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 11]: `` I love you for talking so of my Peggy .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 12]: He is a good pony , though a little playful sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 9]: Would you like a ride upon him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 6]: `` You darling beauty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 5]: cried Rosamond , sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 12]: `` I do love you so , you are so good .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 8]: How did you become so sweet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 10]: `` Would you like to ride my pony ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 12]: repeated the child , with a heavenly smile in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 12]: `` No , no ; he is fit only for you .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 11]: My clumsy body would hurt him , '' said Rosamond .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 12]: `` You do n't mind me having such a pony ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 4]: said the child .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 4]: mind it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 6]: cried Rosamond , almost indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 25]: Then remembering certain thoughts that had but a few moments before passed through her mind , she looked on the ground and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 10]: `` You do n't mind it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 4]: repeated the child .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 36]: `` I am very glad there is such a you and such a pony , and that such a you has got such a pony , '' said Rosamond , still looking on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 15]: `` But I do wish the flowers would not die when I touch them .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 26]: I was cross to see you make them grow , but now I should be content if only I did not make them wither . ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 39]: As she spoke , she stroked the little girl 's bare feet , which were by her , half buried in the soft moss , and as she ended she laid her cheek on them and kissed them .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 5]: `` Dear princess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 16]: said the little girl , `` the flowers will not always wither at your touch .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 9]: Try now -- only do not pluck it .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 11]: Flowers ought never to be plucked except to give away .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 5]: Touch it gently . ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 15]: A silvery flower , something like a snow-drop , grew just within her reach .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 10]: Timidly she stretched out her hand and touched it .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 10]: The flower trembled , but neither shrank nor withered .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 10]: `` Touch it again , '' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 13]: It changed color a little , and Rosamond fancied it grew larger .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 10]: `` Touch it again , '' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 27]: It opened and grew until it was as large as a narcissus , and changed and deepened in color till it was a red glowing gold .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 4]: Rosamond gazed motionless .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 32]: When the transfiguration of the flower was perfected , she sprang to her feet with clasped hands , but for very ecstasy of joy stood speechless , gazing at the child .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 11]: `` Did you never see me before , Rosamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 10]: `` No , never , '' answered the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 11]: `` I never saw any thing half so lovely . ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 10]: `` Look at me , '' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 17]: And as Rosamond looked , the child began , like the flower , to grow larger .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 34]: Quickly through every gradation of growth she passed , until she stood before her a woman perfectly beautiful , neither old nor young ; for hers was the old age of everlasting youth .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 20]: Rosamond was utterly enchanted , and stood gazing without word or movement until she could endure no more delight .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 14]: Then her mind collapsed to the thought -- had the pony grown too ?
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 4]: She glanced round .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 41]: There was no pony , no grass , no flowers , no bright-birded forest -- but the cottage of the wise woman -- and before her , on the hearth of it , the goddess-child , the only thing unchanged .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 5]: She gasped with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 17]: `` You must set out for your father 's palace immediately , '' said the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 9]: `` But where is the wise woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 7]: asked Rosamond , looking all about .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 8]: `` Here , '' said the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 20]: And Rosamond , looking again , saw the wise woman , folded as usual in her long dark cloak .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 10]: `` And it was you all the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 17]: she cried in delight , and kneeled before her , burying her face in her garments .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 18]: `` It always is me , all the time , '' said the wise woman , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 9]: `` But which is the real you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 9]: asked Rosamond ; `` this or that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 7]: `` Or a thousand others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 5]: returned the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 27]: `` But the one you have just seen is the likest to the real me that you are able to see just yet -- but -- .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 13]: And that me you could not have seen a little while ago .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 47]: -- But , my darling child , '' she went on , lifting her up and clasping her to her bosom , `` you must not think , because you have seen me once , that therefore you are capable of seeing me at all times .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 18]: No ; there are many things in you yet that must be changed before that can be .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 9]: Now , however , you will seek me .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 17]: Every time you feel you want me , that is a sign I am wanting you .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 43]: There are yet many rooms in my house you may have to go through ; but when you need no more of them , then you will be able to throw flowers like the little girl you saw in the forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 6]: The princess gave a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 27]: `` Do not think , '' the wise woman went on , `` that the things you have seen in my house are mere empty shows .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 18]: You do not know , you can not yet think , how living and true they are .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 7]: -- Now you must go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 30]: She led her once more into the great hall , and there showed her the picture of her father 's capital , and his palace with the brazen gates .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 10]: `` There is your home , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 6]: `` Go to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 14]: The princess understood , and a flush of shame rose to her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 27]: She turned to the wise woman and said : `` Will you forgive ALL my naughtiness , and ALL the trouble I have given you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 19]: `` If I had not forgiven you , I would never have taken the trouble to punish you .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 21]: If I had not loved you , do you think I would have carried you away in my cloak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 18]: `` How could you love such an ugly , ill-tempered , rude , hateful little wretch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 24]: `` I saw , through it all , what you were going to be , '' said the wise woman , kissing her .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 15]: `` But remember you have yet only BEGUN to be what I saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 23]: `` I will try to remember , '' said the princess , holding her cloak , and looking up in her face .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 11]: `` Go , then , '' said the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 75]: Rosamond turned away on the instant , ran to the picture , stepped over the frame of it , heard a door close gently , gave one glance back , saw behind her the loveliest palace-front of alabaster , gleaming in the pale-yellow light of an early summer-morning , looked again to the eastward , saw the faint outline of her father 's city against the sky , and ran off to reach it .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 33]: It looked much further off now than when it seemed a picture , but the sun was not yet up , and she had the whole of a summer day before her .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 2]: XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 38]: The soldiers sent out by the king , had no great difficulty in finding Agnes 's father and mother , of whom they demanded if they knew any thing of such a young princess as they described .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 196]: The honest pair told them the truth in every point -- that , having lost their own child and found another , they had taken her home , and treated her as their own ; that she had indeed called herself a princess , but they had not believed her , because she did not look like one ; that , even if they had , they did not know how they could have done differently , seeing they were poor people , who could not afford to keep any idle person about the place ; that they had done their best to teach her good ways , and had not parted with her until her bad temper rendered it impossible to put up with her any longer ; that , as to the king 's proclamation , they heard little of the world 's news on their lonely hill , and it had never reached them ; that if it had , they did not know how either of them could have gone such a distance from home , and left their sheep or their cottage , one or the other , uncared for .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 40]: `` You must learn , then , how both of you can go , and your sheep must take care of your cottage , '' said the lawyer , and commanded the soldiers to bind them hand and foot .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 64]: Heedless of their entreaties to be spared such an indignity , the soldiers obeyed , bore them to a cart , and set out for the king 's palace , leaving the cottage door open , the fire burning , the pot of potatoes boiling upon it , the sheep scattered over the hill , and the dogs not knowing what to do .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 43]: Hardly were they gone , however , before the wise woman walked up , with Prince behind her , peeped into the cottage , locked the door , put the key in her pocket , and then walked away up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 33]: In a few minutes there arose a great battle between Prince and the dog which filled his former place -- a well-meaning but dull fellow , who could fight better than feed .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 46]: Prince was not long in showing him that he was meant for his master , and then , by his efforts , and directions to the other dogs , the sheep were soon gathered again , and out of danger from foxes and bad dogs .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 39]: As soon as this was done , the wise woman left them in charge of Prince , while she went to the next farm to arrange for the folding of the sheep and the feeding of the dogs .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 30]: When the soldiers reached the palace , they were ordered to carry their prisoners at once into the presence of the king and queen , in the throne room .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 30]: Their two thrones stood upon a high dais at one end , and on the floor at the foot of the dais , the soldiers laid their helpless prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 16]: The queen commanded that they should be unbound , and ordered them to stand up .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 17]: They obeyed with the dignity of insulted innocence , and their bearing offended their foolish majesties .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 26]: Meantime the princess , after a long day 's journey , arrived at the palace , and walked up to the sentry at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 9]: `` Stand back , '' said the sentry .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 17]: `` I wish to go in , if you please , '' said the princess gently .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 58]: laughed the sentry , for he was one of those dull people who form their judgment from a person 's clothes , without even looking in his eyes ; and as the princess happened to be in rags , her request was amusing , and the booby thought himself quite clever for laughing at her so thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 11]: `` I am the princess , '' Rosamond said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 5]: `` WHAT princess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 4]: bellowed the man .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 5]: `` The princess Rosamond .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 5]: Is there another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 5]: she answered and asked .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 26]: But the man was so tickled at the wondrous idea of a princess in rags , that he scarcely heard what she said for laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 38]: As soon as he recovered a little , he proceeded to chuck the princess under the chin , saying -- `` You 're a pretty girl , my dear , though you ai n't no princess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 6]: Rosamond drew back with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 13]: `` You have spoken three untruths at once , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 53]: `` I am NOT pretty , and I AM a princess , and if I were dear to you , as I ought to be , you would not laugh at me because I am badly dressed , but stand aside , and let me go to my father and mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 45]: The tone of her speech , and the rebuke she gave him , made the man look at her ; and looking at her , he began to tremble inside his foolish body , and wonder whether he might not have made a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 33]: He raised his hand in salute , and said -- `` I beg your pardon , miss , but I have express orders to admit no child whatever within the palace gates .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 15]: They tell me his majesty the king says he is sick of children . ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 10]: `` He may well be sick of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 19]: thought the princess ; `` but it ca n't mean that he does not want me home again .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 26]: -- I do n't think you can very well call me a child , '' she said , looking the sentry full in the face .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 32]: `` You ai n't very big , miss , '' answered the soldier , `` but so be you say you ai n't a child , I 'll take the risk .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 15]: The king can only kill me , and a man must die once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 14]: He opened the gate , stepped aside , and allowed her to pass .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 27]: Had she lost her temper , as every one but the wise woman would have expected of her , he certainly would not have done so .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 41]: She ran into the palace , the door of which had been left open by the porter when he followed the soldiers and prisoners to the throne-room , and bounded up the stairs to look for her father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 79]: As she passed the door of the throne-room she heard an unusual noise in it , and running to the king 's private entrance , over which hung a heavy curtain , she peeped past the edge of it , and saw , to her amazement , the shepherd and shepherdess standing like culprits before the king and queen , and the same moment heard the king say -- `` Peasants , where is the princess Rosamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 15]: `` Truly , sire , we do not know , '' answered the shepherd .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 11]: `` You ought to know , '' said the king .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 11]: `` Sire , we could keep her no longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 34]: `` You confess , then , '' said the king , suppressing the outbreak of the wrath that boiled up in him , `` that you turned her out of your house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 23]: For the king had been informed by a swift messenger of all that had passed long before the arrival of the prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 27]: `` We did , sire ; but not only could we keep her no longer , but we knew not that she was the princess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 21]: `` You ought to have known , the moment you cast your eyes upon her , '' said the king .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 24]: `` Any one who does not know a princess the moment he sees her , ought to have his eyes put out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 10]: `` Indeed he ought , '' said the queen .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 13]: To this they returned no answer , for they had none ready .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 30]: `` Why did you not bring her at once to the palace , '' pursued the king , `` whether you knew her to be a princess or not ?
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 8]: My proclamation left nothing to your judgment .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 6]: It said EVERY CHILD . ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 11]: `` We heard nothing of the proclamation , sire . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 12]: `` You ought to have heard , '' said the king .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 17]: `` It is enough that I make proclamations ; it is for you to read them .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 17]: Are they not written in letters of gold upon the brazen gates of this palace ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 38]: `` A poor shepherd , your majesty -- how often must he leave his flock , and go hundreds of miles to look whether there may not be something in letters of gold upon the brazen gates ?
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 21]: We did not know that your majesty had made a proclamation , or even that the princess was lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 12]: `` You ought to have known , '' said the king .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 6]: The shepherd held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 30]: `` But , '' said the queen , taking up the word , `` all that is as nothing , when I think how you misused the darling . ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 45]: The only ground the queen had for saying thus , was what Agnes had told her as to how the princess was dressed ; and her condition seemed to the queen so miserable , that she had imagined all sorts of oppression and cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 17]: But this was more than the shepherdess , who had not yet spoken , could bear .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 29]: `` She would have been dead , and NOT buried , long ago , madam , if I had not carried her home in my two arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 10]: `` Why does she say her TWO arms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 6]: said the king to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 7]: `` Has she more than two ?
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 7]: Is there treason in that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 13]: `` You dressed her in cast-off clothes , '' said the queen .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 13]: `` I dressed her in my own sweet child 's Sunday clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 10]: And this is what I get for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 8]: cried the shepherdess , bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 14]: `` And what did you do with the clothes you took off her ?
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 4]: Sell them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 9]: `` Put them in the fire , madam .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 12]: They were not fit for the poorest child in the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 18]: They were so ragged that you could see her skin through them in twenty different places . ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 14]: `` You cruel woman , to torture a mother 's feelings so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 12]: cried the queen , and in her turn burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 28]: `` And I 'm sure , '' sobbed the shepherdess , `` I took every pains to teach her what it was right for her to know .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 16]: I taught her to tidy the house and '' -- `` Tidy the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 4]: moaned the queen .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 7]: `` My poor wretched offspring ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 15]: `` And peel the potatoes , and '' -- `` Peel the potatoes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 4]: cried the queen .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 6]: `` Oh , horror ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 13]: `` And black her master 's boots , '' said the shepherdess .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 8]: `` Black her master 's boots ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 4]: shrieked the queen .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 7]: `` Oh , my white-handed princess !
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 7]: Oh , my ruined baby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 54]: `` What I want to know , '' said the king , paying no heed to this maternal duel , but patting the top of his sceptre as if it had been the hilt of a sword which he was about to draw , `` is , where the princess is now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 19]: The shepherd made no answer , for he had nothing to say more than he had said already .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 7]: `` You have murdered her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 4]: shouted the king .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 34]: `` You shall be tortured till you confess the truth ; and then you shall be tortured to death , for you are the most abominable wretches in the whole wide world . ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 8]: `` Who accuses me of crime ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 6]: cried the shepherd , indignant .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 27]: `` I accuse you , '' said the king ; `` but you shall see , face to face , the chief witness to your villany .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 7]: Officer , bring the girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 8]: Silence filled the hall while they waited .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 9]: The king 's face was swollen with anger .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 8]: The queen hid hers behind her handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 13]: The shepherd and shepherdess bent their eyes on the ground , wondering .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 35]: It was with difficulty Rosamond could keep her place , but so wise had she already become that she saw it would be far better to let every thing come out before she interfered .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 25]: At length the door opened , and in came the officer , followed by Agnes , looking white as death and mean as sin .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 24]: The shepherdess gave a shriek , and darted towards her with arms spread wide ; the shepherd followed , but not so eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 4]: `` My child !

Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 9]: Take all three of them to the rack .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 15]: Stretch them till their joints are torn asunder , and give them no water .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 5]: Away with them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 9]: The soldiers approached to lay hands on them .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 4]: But , behold !
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 44]: a girl all in rags , with such a radiant countenance that it was right lovely to see , darted between , and careless of the royal presence , flung herself upon the shepherdess , crying , -- `` Do not touch her .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 9]: She is my good , kind mistress . ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 18]: But the shepherdess could hear or see no one but her Agnes , and pushed her away .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 32]: Then the princess turned , with the tears in her eyes , to the shepherd , and threw her arms about his neck and pulled down his head and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 23]: And the tall shepherd lifted her to his bosom and kept her there , but his eyes were fixed on his Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 9]: `` What is the meaning of this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 10]: cried the king , starting up from his throne .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 10]: `` How did that ragged girl get in here ?
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 7]: Take her away with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 9]: She is one of them , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 52]: But the princess made the shepherd set her down , and before any one could interfere she had run up the steps of the dais and then the steps of the king 's throne like a squirrel , flung herself upon the king , and begun to smother him with kisses .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 18]: All stood astonished , except the three peasants , who did not even see what took place .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 38]: The shepherdess kept calling to her Agnes , but she was so ashamed that she did not dare even lift her eyes to meet her mother 's , and the shepherd kept gazing on her in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 33]: As for the king , he was so breathless and aghast with astonishment , that he was too feeble to fling the ragged child from him , as he tried to do .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 27]: But she left him , and running down the steps of the one throne and up those of the other , began kissing the queen next .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 16]: But the queen cried out , -- `` Get away , you great rude child !
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 10]: -- Will nobody take her to the rack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 53]: Then the princess , hardly knowing what she did for joy that she had come in time , ran down the steps of the throne and the dais , and placing herself between the shepherd and shepherdess , took a hand of each , and stood looking at the king and queen .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 6]: Their faces began to change .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 8]: At last they began to know her .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 55]: But she was so altered -- so lovelily altered , that it was no wonder they should not have known her at the first glance ; but it was the fault of the pride and anger and injustice with which their hearts were filled , that they did not know her at the second .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 42]: The king gazed and the queen gazed , both half risen from their thrones , and looking as if about to tumble down upon her , if only they could be right sure that the ragged girl was their own child .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 9]: A mistake would be such a dreadful thing !
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 5]: `` My darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 10]: at last shrieked the mother , a little doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 7]: `` My pet of pets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 11]: cried the father , with an interrogative twist of tone .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 15]: Another moment , and they were half way down the steps of the dais .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 47]: said a voice of command from somewhere in the hall , and , king and queen as they were , they stopped at once half way , then drew themselves up , stared , and began to grow angry again , but durst not go farther .

Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 7]: Every one made way for her .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 15]: She came straight on until she stood in front of the king and queen .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 7]: `` Miserable man and woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 36]: she said , in words they alone could hear , `` I took your daughter away when she was worthy of such parents ; I bring her back , and they are unworthy of her .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 40]: That you did not know her when she came to you is a small wonder , for you have been blind in soul all your lives : now be blind in body until your better eyes are unsealed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 6]: She threw her cloak open .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 40]: It fell to the ground , and the radiance that flashed from her robe of snowy whiteness , from her face of awful beauty , and from her eyes that shone like pools of sunlight , smote them blind .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 37]: Rosamond saw them give a great start , shudder , waver to and fro , then sit down on the steps of the dais ; and she knew they were punished , but knew not how .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 20]: She rushed up to them , and catching a hand of each said -- `` Father , dear father !
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 3]: mother dear !
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 11]: I will ask the wise woman to forgive you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 7]: `` Oh , I am blind !
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 5]: I am blind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 4]: they cried together .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 5]: `` Dark as night !
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 4]: Stone blind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 25]: Rosamond left them , sprang down the steps , and kneeling at her feet , cried , `` Oh , my lovely wise woman !
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 5]: do let them see .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 13]: Do open their eyes , dear , good , wise woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 24]: The wise woman bent down to her , and said , so that none else could hear , `` I will one day .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 13]: Meanwhile you must be their servant , as I have been yours .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 13]: Bring them to me , and I will make them welcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 51]: Rosamond rose , went up the steps again to her father and mother , where they sat like statues with closed eyes , half-way from the top of the dais where stood their empty thrones , seated herself between them , took a hand of each , and was still .

Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 19]: The moment she threw off her cloak she vanished from the sight of almost all who were present .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 40]: The woman who swept and dusted the hall and brushed the thrones , saw her , and the shepherd had a glimmering vision of her ; but no one else that I know of caught a glimpse of her .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 7]: The shepherdess did not see her .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 21]: Nor did Agnes , but she felt her presence upon her like the beat of a furnace seven times heated .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 31]: As soon as Rosamond had taken her place between her father and mother , the wise woman lifted her cloak from the floor , and threw it again around her .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 27]: Then everybody saw her , and Agnes felt as if a soft dewy cloud had come between her and the torrid rays of a vertical sun .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 10]: The wise woman turned to the shepherd and shepherdess .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 21]: `` For you , '' she said , `` you are sufficiently punished by the work of your own hands .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 67]: Instead of making your daughter obey you , you left her to be a slave to herself ; you coaxed when you ought to have compelled ; you praised when you ought to have been silent ; you fondled when you ought to have punished ; you threatened when you ought to have inflicted -- and there she stands , the full-grown result of your foolishness !
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 8]: She is your crime and your punishment .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 20]: Take her home with you , and live hour after hour with the pale-hearted disgrace you call your daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 15]: What she is , the worm at her heart has begun to teach her .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 11]: When life is no longer endurable , come to me .

Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 13]: `` I will see to that , '' said the wise woman .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 16]: `` But little of home you will find it until you have come to me .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 13]: The king carried you hither , and he shall carry you back .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 9]: But your husband shall not go with you .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 9]: He can not now if he would . ''
