Parsing [sent. 4 len. 51]: ADELA CATHCART Originally published in 1864 With appreciation to Mrs. Morag Black for the master copies of Volumes II and III , to the Bodleian Library for the photo-copies of Volume I , and to Miss Tracy Samuel for type-copying Volumes I , II , and III for this Edition .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 6]: To John Rutherfurd Russell M.D. .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 9]: This book is affectionately dedicated by the author .

Parsing [sent. 8 len. 5]: Chapter I. Christmas Eve .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 13]: It was the afternoon of Christmas Eve , sinking towards the night .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 35]: All day long the wintry light had been diluted with fog , and now the vanguard of the darkness coming to aid the mist , the dying day was well nigh smothered between them .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 78]: When I looked through the window , it was into a vague and dim solidification of space , a mysterious region in which awful things might be going on , and out of which anything might come ; but out of which nothing came in the meantime , except small sparkles of snow , or rather ice , which as we swept rapidly onwards , and the darkness deepened , struck faster and faster against the weather-windows .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 56]: For we , that is , myself and a fellow-passenger , of whom I knew nothing yet but the waistcoat and neckcloth , having caught a glimpse of them as he searched for an obstinate railway-ticket , were in a railway-carriage , darting along , at an all but frightful rate , northwards from London .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 43]: Being , the sole occupants of the carriage , we had made the most of it , like Englishmen , by taking seats diagonally opposite to each other , laying our heads in the corners , and trying to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 13]: But for me it was of no use to try any longer .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 25]: Not that I had anything particular on my mind or spirits ; but a man can not always go to sleep at spare moments .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 32]: If anyone can , let him consider it a great gift , and make good use of it accordingly ; that is , by going to sleep on every such opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 55]: As I , however , could not sleep , much as I should have enjoyed it , I proceeded to occupy my very spare time with building , up what I may call a conjectural mould , into which the face , dress , carriage , & c. , of my companion would fit .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 22]: I had already discovered that he was a clergyman ; but this added to my difficulties in constructing the said mould .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 58]: For , theoretically , I had a great dislike to clergymen ; having , hitherto , always found that the _ clergy _ absorbed the _ man _ ; and that the _ cloth _ , as they called it even themselves , would be no bad epithet for the individual , as well as the class .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 48]: For all clergymen whom I had yet met , regarded mankind and their interests solely from the clerical point of view , seeming far more desirous that a man should be a good church man , as they called it , than that he should love God .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 20]: Hence , there was always an indescribable and , to me , unpleasant odour of their profession about them .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 28]: If they knew more concerning the _ life _ of the world than other men , why should everything they said remind one of mustiness and mildew ?
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 26]: In a word , why were they not men at worst , when at best they ought to be more of men than other men ?
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 35]: -- And here lay the difficulty : by no effort could I get the face before me to fit into the clerical mould which I had all ready in my own mind for it .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 20]: That was , at all events , the face of a man , in spite of waistcoat and depilation .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 30]: I was not even surprised when , all at once , he sat upright in his seat , and asked me if I would join him in a cigar .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 4]: I gladly consented .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 33]: And here let me state a fact , which added then to my interest in my fellow-passenger , and will serve now to excuse the enormity of smoking in a railway carriage .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 29]: We were going to the same place -- we must be ; and nobody would enter that carriage to-night , but the man who had to clean it .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 77]: For , although we were shooting along at a terrible rate , the train would not stop to set us down , but would cast us loose a mile from our station ; and some minutes after it had shot by like an infernal comet of darkness , our carriage would trot gently up to the platform , as if it had come from London all on its own hook -- and thought nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 13]: We were a long way yet , however , from our destination .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 63]: The night grew darker and colder , and after the necessary unmuffling occasioned by the cigar process , we drew our wraps closer about us , leaned back in our corners , and smoked away in silence ; the red glow of our cigars serving to light the carriage nearly as well as the red nose of the neglected and half-extinguished lamp .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 30]: For we were in a second-class carriage , a fact for which I leave the clergyman to apologize : it is nothing to me , for I am nobody .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 37]: But , after all , I fear I am unjust to the Railway Company , for there was light enough for me to see , and in some measure scrutinize , the face of my fellow-passenger .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 38]: I could discern a strong chin , and good , useful jaws ; with a firm-lipped mouth , and a nose more remarkable for quantity than disposition of mass , being rather low , and very thick .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 12]: It was surmounted by two brilliant , kindly , black eyes .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 31]: I lay in wait for his forehead , as if I had been a hunter , and he some peculiar animal that wanted killing right in the middle of it .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 15]: But it was some time before I was gratified with a sight of it .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 14]: I did see it , however , and I _ was _ gratified .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 58]: For when he wanted to throw away the end of his cigar , finding his window immovable -LRB- the frosty wind that bore the snow-flakes blowing from that side -RRB- , and seeing that I opened mine to accommodate him , he moved across , and , in so doing , knocked his hat against the roof .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 13]: As he displaced , to replace it , I had my opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 15]: It was a splendid forehead for size every way , but chiefly for breadth .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 22]: A kind of rugged calm rested upon it -- a suggestion of slumbering power , which it delighted me to contemplate .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 25]: I felt that that was the sort of man to make a friend of , if one had the good luck to be able .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 12]: But I did not yet make any advance towards further acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 26]: My reader may , however , be desirous of knowing what kind of person is making so much use of the pronoun _ I _ .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 28]: He may have the same curiosity to know his fellow-traveller over the region of these pages , that I had to see the forehead of the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 24]: I can at least prevent any further inconvenience from this possible curiosity , by telling him enough to destroy his interest in me .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 111]: I am an -- ; well , I suppose I _ am _ an old bachelor ; not very far from fifty , in fact ; old enough , at all events , to be able to take pleasure in watching without sharing ; yet ready , notwithstanding , when occasion offers , to take any necessary part in what may be going on , I am able , as it were , to sit quietly alone , and look down upon life from a second-floor window , delighting myself with my own speculations , and weaving the various threads I gather , into webs of varying kind and quality .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 42]: Yet , as I have already said in another form , I am not the last to rush down stairs and into the street , upon occasion of an accident or a row in it , or a conflagration next door .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 37]: I may just mention , too , that having many years ago formed the Swedenborgian resolution of never growing old , I am as yet able to flatter myself that I am likely to keep it .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 32]: In proof of this , if further garrulity about myself can be pardoned , I may state that every year , as Christmas approaches , I begin to grow young again .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 78]: At least I judge so from the fact that a strange , mysterious pleasure , well known to me by this time , though little understood and very varied , begins to glow in my mind with the first hint , come from what quarter it may , whether from the church service , or a bookseller 's window , that the day of all the year is at hand -- is climbing up from the under-world .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 7]: I enjoy it like a child .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 51]: I buy the Christmas number of every periodical I can lay my hands on , especially those that have pictures in them ; and although I am not very fond of plum-pudding , I anticipate with satisfaction the roast beef and the old port that ought always to accompany it .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 18]: And above all things , I delight in listening to stories , and sometimes in telling them .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 48]: It amuses me to find what a welcome nobody I am amongst young people ; for they think I take no heed of them , and do n't know what they are doing ; when , all the time , I even know what they are thinking .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 36]: They would wonder to know how often I feel exactly as they do ; only I think the feeling is a more earnest and beautiful thing to me than it can be to them yet .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 29]: If I see a child crowing in his mother 's arms , I seem to myself to remember making precisely the same noise in my mother 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 26]: If I see a youth and a maiden looking into each other 's eyes , I know what it means perhaps better than they do .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 5]: But I say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 21]: I do not even smile ; for my face is puckered , and I have a weakness about the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 25]: But all this will be proof enough that I have not grown very old , in any bad and to-be-avoided sense , at least .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 17]: And now all the glow of the Christmas time was at its height in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 39]: For I was going to spend the Day , and a few weeks besides , with a very old friend of mine , who lived near the town at which we were about to arrive like a postscript .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 8]: -- Where could my companion be going ?
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 16]: I wanted to know , because I hoped to meet him again somehow or other .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 53]: I ought to have told you , kind reader , that my name is Smith -- actually _ John _ Smith ; but I 'm none the worse for that ; and as I do not want to be distinguished much from other people , I do not feel it a hardship .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 7]: But where was my companion going ?
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 18]: It could not be to my friend 's ; else I should have known something about him .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 40]: It could hardly be to the clergyman 's , because the vicarage was small , and there was a new curate coming with his wife , whom it would probably have to accommodate until their own house was ready .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 25]: It could not be to the lawyer 's on the hill , because there all were from home on a visit to their relations .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 41]: It might be to Squire Vernon 's , but he was the last man likely to ask a clergyman to visit him ; nor would a clergyman be likely to find himself comfortable with the swearing old fox - hunter .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 13]: The question must , then , for the present , remain unsettled .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 22]: -- So I left it , and , looking out of the window once more , buried myself in Christmas fancies .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 5]: It was now dark .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 9]: We were the under half of the world .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 18]: The sun was scorching and glowing on the other side , leaving us to night and frost .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 26]: But the night and the frost wake the sunshine of a higher world in our hearts ; and who cares for winter weather at Christmas ?
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 16]: -- I believe in the proximate correctness of the date of our Saviour 's birth .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 8]: I believe he always comes in winter .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 20]: And then let Winter reign without : Love is king within ; and Love is lord of the Winter .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 8]: How the happy fires were glowing everywhere !
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 16]: We shot past many a lighted cottage , and now and then a brilliant mansion .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 31]: Inside both were hearts like our own , and faces like ours , with the red coming out on them , the red of joy , because it was Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 12]: And most of them had some little feast _ toward _ .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 9]: Is it vulgar , this feasting at Christmas ?
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 33]: It is the Christmas feast that justifies all feasts , as the bread and wine of the Communion are the essence of all bread and wine , of all strength and rejoicing .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 33]: If the Christianity of eating is lost -- I will not say _ forgotten _ -- the true type of eating is to be found at the dinner-hour in the Zoological Gardens .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 59]: Certain I am , that but for the love which , ever revealing itself , came out brightest at that first Christmas time , there would be no feasting -- nay no smiling ; no world to go careering in joy about its central fire ; no men and women upon it , to look up and rejoice .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 13]: `` But you always look on the bright side of things . ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 13]: No one spoke aloud ; I heard the objection in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 21]: Could it come from the mind of my friend -- for so I already counted him -- opposite to me ?
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 19]: There was no need for that supposition -- I had heard the objection too often in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 12]: And now I answered it in set , though unspoken form .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 23]: `` Yes , '' I said , `` I do ; for I keep in the light as much as I can .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 12]: Let the old heathens count Darkness the womb of all things .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 22]: I count Light the older , from the tread of whose feet fell the first shadow -- and that was Darkness .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 13]: Darkness exists but by the light , and for the light . ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 7]: `` But that is all mysticism .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 4]: Look about you .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 12]: The dark places of the earth are the habitations of cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 8]: Men and women blaspheme God and die .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 11]: How can this then be an hour for rejoicing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 8]: `` They are in God 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 14]: Take from me my rejoicing , and I am powerless to help them .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 21]: It shall not destroy the whole bright holiday to me , that my father has given my brother a beating .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 6]: It will do him good .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 5]: He needed it somehow .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 8]: -- He is looking after them . ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 10]: Could I have spoken some of these words aloud ?
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 34]: For the eyes of the clergyman were fixed upon me from his corner , as if he were trying to put off his curiosity with the sop of a probable conjecture about me .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 16]: `` I fear he would think me a heathen , '' I said to myself .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 16]: `` But if ever there was humanity in a countenance , there it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 20]: It grew more and more pleasant to think of the bright fire and the cheerful room that awaited me .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 23]: Nor was the idea of the table , perhaps already beginning to glitter with crystal and silver , altogether uninteresting to me .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 6]: For I was growing hungry .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 13]: But the speed at which we were now going was quite comforting .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 6]: I dropped into a reverie .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 28]: I was roused from it by the sudden ceasing of the fierce oscillation , which had for some time been threatening to make a jelly of us .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 4]: We were loose .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 10]: In three minutes more we should be at Purleybridge .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 24]: And in three minutes more , we were at Purleybridge -- the only passengers but one who arrived at the station that night .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 37]: A servant was waiting for me , and I followed him through the booking-office to the carriage destined to bear me to _ The Swanspond _ , as my friend Colonel Cathcart 's house was called .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 21]: As I stepped into the carriage , I saw the clergyman walk by , with his carpet-bag in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 54]: Now I knew Colonel Cathcart intimately enough to offer the use of his carriage to my late companion ; but at the moment I was about to address him , the third passenger , of whom I had taken no particular notice , came between us , and followed me into the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 59]: This occasioned a certain hesitation , with which I am only too easily affected ; the footman shut the door ; I caught one glimpse of the clergyman turning the corner of the station into a field-path ; the horses made a scramble ; and away I rode to the Swanspond , feeling as selfish as ten Pharisees .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 47]: It is true , I had not spoken a word to him beyond accepting his invitation to smoke with him ; and yet I felt almost sure that we should meet again , and that when we did , we should both be glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 18]: And now he was carrying a carpet-bag , and I was seated in a carriage and pair !
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 77]: It was far too dark for me to see what my new companion was like ; but when the light from the colonel 's hall-door flashed upon us as we drew up , I saw that he was a young man , with a certain expression in his face which a first glance might have taken for fearlessness and power of some sort , but which notwithstanding , I felt to be rather repellent than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 31]: The moment the carriage-door was opened , he called the servant by his name , saying , `` When the cart comes with the luggage , send mine up directly .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 5]: Take that now . ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 7]: And he handed him his dressing-bag .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 36]: He spoke in a self-approving tone , and with a drawl which I will not attempt to imitate , because I find all such imitation tends to caricature ; and I want to be believed .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 17]: Besides , I find the production of caricature has unfailingly a bad moral reaction upon myself .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 25]: I daresay it is not so with others , but with that I have nothing to do : it is one of my weaknesses .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 54]: My worthy old friend , the colonel , met us in the hall -- straight , broad-shouldered , and tall , with a severe military expression underlying the genuine hospitality of his countenance , as if he could not get rid of a sense of duty even when doing what he liked best .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 41]: The door of the dining-room was partly open , and from it came the red glow of a splendid fire , the chink of encountering glass and metal , and , best of all , the pop of a cork .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 20]: `` Would you like to go up-stairs , Smith , or will you have a glass of wine first ?
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 9]: -- How do you do , Percy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 17]: `` Thank you ; I 'll go to my room at once , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 11]: `` You 'll find a fire there , I know .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 11]: Having no regiment now , I look after my servants .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 7]: Mind you make use of them .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 11]: I ca n't find enough of work for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 37]: He left me , and again addressed the youth , who had by this time got out of his great-coat , and , cold as it was , stood looking at his hands by the hall-lamp .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 24]: As I moved away , I heard him say , in a careless tone , `` And how 's Adela , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 17]: The reply did not reach me , but I knew now who the young fellow was .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 55]: Hearing a kind of human grunt behind me , I turned and saw that I was followed by the butler ; and , by a kind of intuition , I knew that this grunt was a remark , an inarticulate one , true , but not the less to the point on that account .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 34]: I knew that he had been in the dining-room by the pop I had heard ; and I knew by the grunt that he had heard his master 's observation about his servants .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 17]: `` Come , Beeves , '' I said , `` I do n't want your help .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 27]: You 've got plenty to do , you know , at dinner-time ; and your master is rather hard upon you -- is n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 8]: I knew the man , of course .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 20]: `` Well , Mr. Smith , master is the best master in the country , _ he is _ .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 16]: But he do n't know what work is , _ he do n't _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 13]: `` Well , go to your work , and never mind me .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 15]: I know every turn in the house as well as yourself , Beeves . ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 18]: `` No , Mr. Smith ; I 'll attend to you , if _ you _ please .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 12]: Mr. Percy will take care of _ his _ - self .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 7]: There 's no fear of him .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 6]: But you 're my business .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 19]: You are sure to give a man a kind word who does his best to please you . ''
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 17]: `` Why , Beeves , I think that is the least a man can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 19]: `` It 's the most too , sir ; and some people think it 's too much . ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 14]: I saw that the man was hurt , and sought to soothe him .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 14]: `` You and I are old friends , at least , Beeves . ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 6]: `` Yes , Mr. Smith .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 9]: Money wo n't do ` t , sir .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 14]: My master gives good wages , and I 'm quite independing of visitors .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 51]: But when a gentleman says to me , ` Beeves , I 'm obliged to you , ' why then , Mr. Smith , you feels at one _ and _ the same time , that he 's a gentleman , and that you aint a boot-jack or a coal-scuttle .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 8]: It 's the sentiman , Mr. Smith .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 11]: If he despises us , why , we despises him .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 14]: And we do n't like waiting on a gentleman as aint a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 22]: Ring the bell , Mr. Smith , when you want anythink , and _ I 'll _ attend to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 11]: He had been twenty years in the colonel 's service .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 26]: He was not an old soldier , yet had a thorough _ esprit de corps _ , looking , upon service as an honourable profession .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 25]: In this he was not only right , but had a vast advantage over everybody whose profession is not sufficiently honourable for his ambition .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 8]: All such must _ feel _ degraded .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 20]: Beeves was fifty ; and , happily for his opinion of his profession , had never been to London .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 21]: And the colonel was the best of masters ; for because he ruled well , every word of kindness told .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 28]: It is with servants as with children and with horses -- it is of no use caressing them unless they know that you mean them to go .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 11]: When the dinner-bell rang , I proceeded to the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 16]: The colonel was there , and I thought for a moment that he was alone .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 29]: But I soon saw that a couch by the fire was occupied by his daughter , the Adela after whose health I had heard young Percy Cathcart inquiring .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 23]: She was our hostess , for Mrs. Cathcart had been dead for many years , and Adela had been her only child .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 41]: I approached to pay my respects , but as soon as I got near enough to see her face , I turned involuntarily to her father , and said , `` Cathcart , you never told me of this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 17]: He made me no reply ; but I saw the long stern upper lip twitching convulsively .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 31]: I turned again to Adela , who tried to smile -- with precisely the effect of a momentary gleam of sunshine upon a cold , leafless , and wet landscape .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 12]: `` Adela , my dear , what is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 9]: `` I do n't know , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 23]: She had called me uncle , since ever she had begun to speak , which must have been nearly twenty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 7]: I stood and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 17]: Her face was pale and thin , and her eyes were large , and yet sleepy .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 28]: I may say at once that she had dark eyes and a sweet face ; and that is all the description I mean to give of her .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 36]: I had been accustomed to see that face , if not rosy , yet plump and healthy ; and those eyes with plenty of light for themselves , and some to spare for other people .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 23]: But it was neither her wan look nor her dull eyes that distressed me : it was the expression of her face .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 24]: It was very sad to look at ; but it was not so much sadness as utter and careless hopelessness that it expressed .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 9]: `` Have you any pain , Adela ? ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 7]: `` No , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 7]: `` But you feel ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 38]: And as she spoke , she tapped with one finger on the edge of the _ couvre-pied _ which was thrown over her , and gave a sigh as if her very heart was weary of everything .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 11]: `` Shall you come down to dinner with us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 11]: `` Yes , uncle ; I suppose I must . ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 19]: `` If you would rather have your dinner sent up , my love -- '' began her father .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 2]: no .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 8]: It is all the same to me .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 8]: I may as well go down . ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 13]: My young companion of the carriage now entered , got up expensively .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 11]: He , too , looked shocked when he saw her .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 6]: `` Why , Addie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 28]: But she received him with perfect indifference , just lifting one cold hand towards his , and then letting it fall again where it had lain before .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 24]: Percy looked a little mortified ; in fact , more mortified now than sorry ; turned away , and stared at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 26]: Every time I open my mouth in a drawing-room before dinner , I am aware of an amount of self-denial worthy of a forlorn hope .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 37]: Yet the silence was so awkward now , that I felt I must make an effort to say something ; and the more original the remark the better I felt it would be for us all .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 31]: But , with the best intentions , all I could effect was to turn towards Mr. Percy and say , `` Rather cold for travelling , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 13]: `` Those foot-warmers are capital things , though , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 6]: `` Mine was jolly hot .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 12]: Might have roasted a potato on it , by Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 24]: `` I came in a second-class carriage , '' I replied ; `` and they are too cold to need a foot-warmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 27]: He gave a shrug with his shoulders , as if he had suddenly found himself in low company , and must make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 7]: But he offered no further remark .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 4]: Beeves announced dinner .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 10]: `` Will you take Adela , Mr. Smith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 4]: said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 19]: `` I think I wo n't go , after all , papa , if you do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 8]: I do n't want any dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 44]: `` Very well , my dear , '' began her father , but could not help showing his distress ; perceiving which , Adela rose instantly from her couch , put her arm in his , and led the way to the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 5]: Percy and I followed .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 11]: `` What can be the matter with the girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 10]: thought I. `` She used to be merry enough .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 9]: Some love affair , I should n't wonder .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 7]: I 've never heard of any .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 23]: I know her father favours that puppy Percy ; but I do n't think she is dying for _ him _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 11]: It was the dreariest Christmas Eve I had ever spent .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 49]: The fire was bright ; the dishes were excellent ; the wine was thorough ; the host was hospitable ; the servants were attentive ; and yet the dinner was as gloomy as if we had all known it to be the last we should ever eat together .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 32]: If a ghost had been sitting in its shroud at the head of the table , instead of Adela , it could hardly have cast a greater chill over the guests .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 35]: She did her duty well enough ; but she did not look it ; and the charities which occasioned her no pleasure in the administration , could hardly occasion us much in the reception .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 32]: As soon as she had left the room , Percy broke out , with more emphasis than politeness : `` What the devil 's the matter with Adela , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 27]: `` Indeed , I ca n't tell , my boy , '' answered the colonel , with more kindness than the form of the question deserved .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 10]: `` Have you no conjecture on the subject ? ''
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 3]: `` None .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 14]: I have tried hard to find out ; but I have altogether failed .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 17]: She tells me there is nothing the matter with her , only she is so tired .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 8]: What has she to tire her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 14]: `` If she is tired inside first , everything will tire her . ''
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 13]: `` I wish you would try to find out , Smith . ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 5]: `` I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 9]: `` Her mother died of a decline . ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 4]: `` I know .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 7]: Have you had no advice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 17]: Dr. Wade is giving her steel-wine , and quinine , and all that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 12]: For my part , I do n't believe in their medicines .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 10]: Certainly they do n't do her any good . ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 11]: `` Is her chest affected -- does he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 29]: `` He says not ; but I believe he knows no more about the state of her chest than he does about the other side of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 7]: He 's a stupid old fool .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 13]: He comes here for his fees , and he has them . ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 16]: `` Why do n't you call in another , if you are not satisfied ? ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 18]: `` Why , my dear fellow , they 're all the same in this infernal old place .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 14]: I believe they 've all embalmed themselves , and are going by clockwork .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 10]: They and the clergy make sad fools of us .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 13]: But we make worse fools of ourselves to have them about us .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 11]: To be sure , they see that everything is proper .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 25]: The doctor makes sure that we are dead before we are buried , and the parson that we are buried after we are dead .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 13]: About the resurrection I suspect he knows as much as we do .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 6]: He goes by book . ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 14]: In his perplexity and sorrow , the poor colonel was irritable and unjust .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 13]: I saw that it would be better to suggest than to reason .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 26]: And I partly took the homoeopathic system -- the only one on which mental distress , at least , can be treated with any advantage .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 31]: `` Certainly , '' I said , `` the medical profession has plenty of men in it who live on humanity , like the very diseases they attempt to cure .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 13]: And plenty of the clergy find the Church a tolerably profitable investment .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 21]: The reading of the absolution is as productive to them now , as it was to the pardon-sellers of old .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 21]: But surely , colonel , you wo n't huddle them all up together in one shapeless mass of condemnation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 17]: `` You always were right , Smith , and I 'm a fool , as usual .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 15]: -- Percy , my boy , what 's going on at Somerset House ? ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 7]: `` The river , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 5]: `` Nothing else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 8]: `` Well -- I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 3]: Nothing much .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 6]: It 's horribly slow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 12]: `` I 'm afraid you wo n't find this much better .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 9]: But you must take care of yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 13]: `` I 've made that a branch of special study , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 11]: I flatter myself I _ can _ do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 4]: Colonel Cathcart laughed .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 23]: Percy was the son of his only brother , who had died young , and he had an especial affection for him .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 40]: And where the honest old man loved , he could see no harm ; for he reasoned something in this way : `` He must be all right , or how could I like him as I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 55]: But Percy was a common-place , selfish fellow -- of that I was convinced -- whatever his other qualities , good or bad , might be ; and I sincerely hoped that any designs he might have of marrying his cousin , might prove as vain as his late infantile passion for the moon .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 48]: For I beg to assure my readers that the circumstances in which I have introduced Adela Cathcart , are no more fair to her real character , than my lady readers would consider the effect of a lamp-shade of bottle-green true in its presentation of their complexion .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 9]: We did not sit long over our wine .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 23]: When we went up to the drawing-room , Adela was not there , nor did she make her appearance again that evening .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 74]: For a little while we tried to talk ; but , after many failures , I yielded and withdrew on the score of fatigue ; no doubt relieving the mind of my old friend by doing so , for he had severe ideas of the duty of a host as well as of a soldier , and to these ideas he found it at present impossible to elevate the tone of his behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 21]: When I reached my own room , I threw myself into the easiest of arm-chairs , and began to reflect .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 36]: `` John Smith , '' I said , `` this is likely to be as uncomfortable a Christmas-tide , as you , with your all but ubiquity , have ever had the opportunity of passing .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 37]: Nevertheless , please to remember a resolution you came to once upon a time , that , as you were nobody , so you would be nobody ; and see if you can make yourself useful .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 10]: -- What can be the matter with Adela ? ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 39]: I sat and reflected for a long time ; for during my life I had had many opportunities of observation , and amongst other cases that had interested me , I had seen some not unlike the present .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 44]: The fact was that , as everybody counted me nobody , I had taken full advantage of my conceded nonentity , which , like Jack the Giant-killer 's coat of darkness , enabled me to learn much that would otherwise have escaped me .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 34]: My reflections on my observations , however , did not lead me to any further or more practical conclusion just yet , than that other and better advice ought to be called in .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 18]: Having administered this sedative sop to my restless practicalness , I went to bed and to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 3]: Chapter II .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 2]: Church .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 21]: Adela did not make her appearance at the breakfast-table next morning , although it was the morning of Christmas Day .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 24]: And no one who had seen her at dinner on Christmas Eve , would have expected to see her at breakfast on Christmas-morn .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 24]: Yet although her absence was rather a relief , such a gloom occupied her place , that our party was anything but cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 29]: But the world about us was happy enough , not merely at its unseen heart of fire , but on its wintered countenance -- evidently to all men .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 75]: It was not `` to hide her guilty front , '' as Milton says , in the first two -- and the least worthy -- stanzas on the Nativity , that the earth wooed the gentle air for innocent snow , but to put on the best smile and the loveliest dress that the cold time and her suffering state would allow , in welcome of the Lord of the snow and the summer .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 62]: I thought of the lines from Crashaw 's _ Hymn of the Nativity _ -- Crashaw , who always suggested to me Shelley turned a Catholic Priest : `` I saw the curled drops , soft and slow , Come hovering o'er the place 's head , Offering their whitest sheets of snow , To furnish the fair infant 's bed .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 22]: Forbear , said I , be not too bold : Your fleece is white , but 't is too cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 51]: And as the sun shone rosy with mist , I naturally thought of the next following stanza of the same hymn : `` I saw the obsequious seraphim Their rosy fleece of fire bestow ; For well they now can spare their wings , Since Heaven itself lies here below .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 3]: Well done !
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 19]: said I ; but are you sure Your down , so warm , will pass for pure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 47]: Adela , pale face and all , was down in time for church ; and she and the colonel and I walked to it together by the meadow path , where , on each side , the green grass was peeping up through the glittering frost .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 38]: For the colonel , notwithstanding his last night 's outbreak upon the clergy , had a profound respect for them , and considered church-going one of those military duties which belonged to every honest soldier and gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 6]: Percy had found employment elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 61]: It was a blessed little church that , standing in a little meadow church-yard , with a low strong ancient tower , and great buttresses that put one in mind of the rock of ages , and a mighty still river that flowed past the tower end , and a picturesque , straggling , well-to-do parsonage at the chancel end .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 41]: The church was nearly covered with ivy , and looked as if it had grown out of the churchyard , to be ready for the poor folks , as soon as they got up again , to praise God in .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 39]: But it had stood a long time , and none of them came , and the praise of the living must be a poor thing to the praise of the dead , notwithstanding all that the Psalmist says .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 17]: So the church got disheartened , and drooped , and now looked very old and grey-headed .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 10]: It could not get itself filled with praise enough .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 28]: -- And into this old , and quaint , and weary but stout-hearted church , we went that bright winter morning , to hear about a baby .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 10]: My heart was full enough before I left it .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 46]: Old Mr. Venables read the service with a voice and manner far more memorial of departed dinners than of joys to come ; but I sat -- little heeding the service , I confess -- with my mind full of thoughts that made me glad .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 15]: Now all my glad thoughts came to me through a hole in the tower-door .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 32]: For the door was far in a shadowy retreat , and in the irregular lozenge-shaped hole in it , there was a piece of coarse thick glass of a deep yellow .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 9]: And through this yellow glass the sun shone .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 25]: And the cold shine of the winter sun was changed into the warm glory of summer by the magic of that bit of glass .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 80]: Now when I saw the glow first , I thought without thinking , that it came from some inner place , some shrine of old , or some ancient tomb in the chancel of the church -- forgetting the points of the compass -- where one might pray as in the _ penetralia _ of the temple ; and I gazed on it as the pilgrim might gaze upon the lamp-light oozing from the cavern of the Holy Sepulchre .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 27]: But some one opened the door , and the clear light of the Christmas morn broke upon the pavement , and swept away the summer splendour .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 8]: -- The door was to the outside .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 38]: -- And I said to myself : All the doors that lead inwards to the secret place of the Most High , are doors outwards -- out of self -- out of smallness -- out of wrong .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 35]: And these were some of the thoughts that came to me through the hole in the door , and made me forget the service , which Mr. Venables mumbled like a nicely cooked sweetbread .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 35]: But another voice broke the film that shrouded the ears of my brain , and the words became inspired and alive , and I forgot my own thoughts in listening to the Holy Book .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 17]: For is not the voice of every loving spirit a fresh inspiration to the dead letter ?
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 12]: With a voice other than this , does it not kill ?
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 22]: And I thought I had heard the voice before , but where I sat I could not see the Communion Table .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 35]: -- At length the preacher ascended the pulpit stairs , and , to my delight and the rousing of an altogether unwonted expectation , who should it be but my fellow-traveller of last night !
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 21]: He had a look of having something to say ; and I immediately felt that I had something to hear .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 31]: Having read his text , which I forget , the broad-browed man began with something like this : `` It is not the high summer alone that is God 's .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 6]: The winter also is His .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 10]: And into His winter He came to visit us .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 36]: And all man 's winters are His -- the winter of our poverty , the winter of our sorrow , the winter of our unhappiness -- even ` the winter of our discontent . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 7]: I stole a glance at Adela .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 9]: Her large eyes were fixed on the preacher .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 24]: `` Winter , '' he went on , `` does not belong to death , although the outside of it looks like death .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 9]: Beneath the snow , the grass is growing .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 11]: Below the frost , the roots are warm and alive .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 18]: Winter is only a spring too weak and feeble for us to see that it is living .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 29]: The cold does for all things what the gardener has sometimes to do for valuable trees : he must half kill them before they will bear any fruit .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 12]: Winter is in truth the small beginnings of the spring . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 16]: I glanced at Adela again ; and still her eyes were fastened on the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 10]: `` The winter is the childhood of the year .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 23]: Into this childhood of the year came the child Jesus ; and into this childhood of the year must we all descend .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 43]: It is as if God spoke to each of us according to our need : My son , my daughter , you are growing old and cunning ; you must grow a child again , with my son , this blessed birth-time .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 13]: You are growing old and selfish ; you must become a child .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 13]: You are growing old and careful ; you must become a child .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 13]: You are growing old and distrustful ; you must become a child .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 47]: You are growing old and petty , and weak , and foolish ; you must become a child -- my child , like the baby there , that strong sunrise of faith and hope and love , lying in his mother 's arms in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 16]: `` But one may say to me : ` You are talking in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 10]: The Son of God is a child no longer .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 8]: He is the King of Heaven . '
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 5]: True , my friends .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 24]: But He who is the Unchangeable , could never become anything that He was not always , for that would be to change .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 12]: He is as much a child now as ever he was .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 31]: When he became a child , it was only to show us by itself , that we might understand it better , what he was always in his deepest nature .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 58]: And when he was a child , he was not less the King of Heaven ; for it is in virtue of his childhood , of his sonship , that he is Lord of Heaven and of Earth -- ` for of such ' -- namely , of children -- ` is the kingdom of heaven . '
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 31]: And , therefore , when we think of the baby now , it is still of the Son of man , of the King of men , that we think .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 80]: And all the feelings that the thought of that babe can wake in us , are as true now as they were on that first Christmas day , when Mary covered from the cold his little naked feet , ere long to be washed with the tears of repentant women , and nailed by the hands of thoughtless men , who knew not what they did , to the cross of fainting , and desolation , and death . ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 7]: Adela was hiding her face now .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 13]: `` So , my friends , let us be children this Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 24]: Of course , when I say to anyone , ` You must be like a child , ' I mean a good child .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 14]: A naughty child is not a child as long as his naughtiness lasts .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 18]: He is not what God meant when He said , ' I will make a child . '
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 18]: Think of the best child you know -- the one who has filled you with most admiration .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 10]: It is his child-likeness that has so delighted you .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 15]: It is because he is so true to the child-nature that you admire him .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 6]: Jesus is like that child .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 7]: You must be like that child .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 21]: But you can not help knowing some faults in him -- some things that are like ill-grown men and women .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 8]: Jesus is not like him , there .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 63]: Think of the best child you can imagine ; nay , think of a better than you can imagine -- of the one that God thinks of when he invents a child in the depth of his fatherhood : such child-like men and women must you one day become ; and what day better to begin , than this blessed Christmas Morn ?
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 12]: Let such a child be born in your hearts this day .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 33]: Take the child Jesus to your bosoms , into your very souls , and let him grow there till he is one with your every thought , and purpose , and hope .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 30]: As a good child born in a family will make the family good ; so Jesus , born into the world , will make the world good at last .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 26]: And this perfect child , born in your hearts , will make your hearts good ; and that is God 's best gift to you .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 16]: `` Then be happy this Christmas Day ; for to you a child is born .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 12]: Childless women , this infant is yours -- wives or maidens .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 16]: Fathers and mothers , he is your first-born , and he will save his brethren .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 36]: Eat and drink , and be merry and kind , for the love of God is the source of all joy and all good things , and this love is present in the child Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 18]: -- Now , to God the Father , & c. '' `` O my baby Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 21]: I said in my heart ; for the clergyman had forgotten me , and said nothing about us old bachelors .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 64]: Of course this is but the substance of the sermon ; and as , although I came to know him well before many days were over , he never lent me his manuscript -- indeed , I doubt if he had any -- my report must have lost something of his nervous strength , and be diluted with the weakness of my style .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 88]: Although I had been attending so well to the sermon , however , my eyes had now and then wandered , not only to Adela 's face , but all over the church as well ; and I could not help observing , a few pillars off , and partly round a corner , the face of a young man -- well , he was about thirty , I should guess -- out of which looked a pair of well-opened hazel eyes , with rather notable eyelashes .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 43]: Not that I , with my own weak pair of washed-out grey , could see the eyelashes at that distance , but I judged it must be their length that gave a kind of feminine cast to the outline of the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 68]: Nor should I have noticed the face itself much , had it not seemed to me that those eyes were pursuing a very thievish course ; for , by the fact that , as often as I looked their way , I saw the motion of their withdrawal , I concluded that they were stealing glances at , certainly not from , my adopted niece , Adela .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 10]: This made me look at the face more attentively .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 13]: I found it a fine , frank , brown , country-looking face .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 12]: -- Could it have anything to do with Adela 's condition ?
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 2]: Absurd !
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 19]: How could such health and ruddy life have anything to do with the worn pallor of her countenance ?
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 23]: Nor did a single glance on the part of Adela reveal that she was aware of the existence of the neighbouring observatory .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 5]: I dismissed the idea .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 9]: And I was right , as time showed .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 6]: We remained to the Communion .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 35]: When that was over , we walked out of the old dark-roofed church , Adela looking as sad as ever , into the bright cold sunshine , which wrought no change on her demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 18]: How could it , if the sun of righteousness , even , had failed for the time ?
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 53]: And there , in the churchyard , we found Percy , standing astride of an infant 's grave , with his hands in his trowser-pockets , and an air of condescending satisfaction on his countenance , which seemed to say to the dead beneath him : `` Pray , do n't apologize .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 39]: I know you are disagreeable ; but you ca n't help it , you know ; '' -- and to the living coming out of church : `` Well , have you had your little whim out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 19]: But what he did say , was to Adela : `` A merry Christmas to you , Addie !
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 7]: Wo n't you lean on me ?
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 8]: You do n't look very stunning . ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 18]: But her sole answer was to take my arm ; and so we walked towards the Swanspond .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 18]: `` I suppose that 's what they call _ Broad Church , _ '' said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 14]: `` Generally speaking , I prefer breadth , '' I answered , vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 10]: `` Do you think that 's _ Broad Church ?
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 5]: _ '' `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 7]: I suppose it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 8]: He ran me through , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 14]: `` I hope it _ is _ all right , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 6]: `` It suits me . ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 15]: `` Well , I 'm sure you know ten times better than I do .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 17]: He seems a right sort of man , whatever sort of clergyman he may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 11]: `` Who is he -- can you tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 8]: `` Why , do n't you know ?
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 10]: That 's our new curate , Mr. Armstrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 4]: `` Curate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 6]: `` A man like that !
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 6]: And at his years too !
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 5]: He must be forty .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 5]: You astonish me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 8]: `` Well , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 5]: He may be forty .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 14]: He is our curate ; that is all I can answer for . ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 12]: `` He was my companion in the train last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 5]: that accounts for it .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 12]: You had some talk with him , and found him out ?
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 12]: I believe he is a superior sort of man , too .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 9]: Old Mr. Venables seems to like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 43]: `` All the talk I have had with him passed between pulpit and pew this morning , '' I replied ; `` for the only words that we exchanged last night were , ` Will you join me in a cigar ? '
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 14]: from him , and ` With much pleasure , ' from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 21]: `` Then , upon my life , I ca n't see what you think remarkable in his being a curate .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 16]: Though I confess , as I said before , he ran me through the body .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 14]: I 'm rather soft-hearted , I believe , since Addie 's illness . ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 7]: He gave her a hasty glance .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 36]: But she took no notice of what he had said ; and , indeed , seemed to have taken no notice of the conversation -- to which Percy had shown an equal amount of indifference .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 11]: A very different indifference seemed the only bond between them .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 32]: When we reached home , we found lunch ready for us , and after waiting a few minutes for Adela , but in vain , we seated ourselves at the table .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 13]: `` Awfully like Sunday , and a cold dinner , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 3]: remarked Percy .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 16]: `` We 'll make up for that , my boy , when dinner-time comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 13]: `` You do n't like Sunday , then , Mr. Percy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 9]: `` A horrid bore , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 9]: `` My old mother made me hate it .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 17]: We had to go to church twice ; and that was even worse than her veal-broth .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 33]: But the worst of it is , I ca n't get it out of my head that I ought to be there , even when I 'm driving tandem to Richmond . ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 15]: your mother will be with us on Sunday , I hope , Percy . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 6]: `` Good heavens , uncle !
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 8]: Do you know what you are about ?
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 4]: My mother here !
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 15]: I 'll just ring the bell , and tell James to pack my traps .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 6]: I wo n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 4]: I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 6]: Indeed I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 6]: He rose as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 26]: His uncle caught him by the arm , laughing , and made him sit down again ; which he did with real or pretended reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 10]: `` We 'll take care of you , Percy .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 3]: Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 20]: -- Do n't be a fool , '' he added , seeing the evident annoyance of the young fellow .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 41]: `` Well , uncle , you ought to have known better , '' said Percy , sulkily , as , yielding , he resumed his seat , and poured himself out a bumper of claret , by way of consolation .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 32]: He had not been much of a companion before : now he made himself almost as unpleasant as a young man could be , and that is saying a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 33]: One , certainly , had need to have found something beautiful at church , for here was the prospect of as wretched a Christmas dinner as one could ever wish to avoid .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 44]: When Percy had drunk another bumper of claret , he rose and left the room ; and my host , turning to me , said : `` I fear , Smith , you will have anything but a merry Christmas , this year .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 18]: I hoped the sight of you would cheer up poor Adela , and set us all right .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 29]: And now Percy 's out of humour at the thought of his mother coming , and I 'm sure I do n't know what 's to be done .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 14]: We shall sit over our dinner to-day like four crows over a carcass .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 10]: It 's very good of you to stop . ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 8]: never mind me , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 11]: `` I , too , can take care of myself .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 11]: But has Adela no companions of her own age ? ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 5]: `` None but Percy .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 11]: And I am afraid she has got tired of him .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 13]: He 's a good fellow , though a bit of a puppy .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 5]: That 'll wear off .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 14]: I wish he would take a fancy to the army , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 11]: I made no reply , but I thought the more .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 28]: It seemed to me that to get tired of Percy was the most natural proceeding that could be adopted with regard to him and all about him .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 12]: But men judge men -- and women , women -- hardly .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 15]: `` I 'll tell you what I will do , '' said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 19]: `` I will ask Mr. Bloomfield , the schoolmaster , and his wife , to dine with us .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 13]: It 's no use asking anybody else that I can think of .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 21]: But they have no family , and I dare say they can put off their own Christmas dinner till to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 14]: They have but one maid , and she can dine with our servants .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 11]: They are very respectable people , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 16]: The colonel always considered his plans thoroughly , and then acted on them at once .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 3]: He rose .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 6]: `` A capital idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 7]: I said , as he disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 8]: I went up to look for Adela .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 7]: She was not in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 14]: I went up again , and tapped at the door of her room .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 13]: `` Come in , '' she said , in a listless voice .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 3]: I entered .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 9]: `` How are you now , Adela ? ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 12]: `` Thank you , uncle , '' was all her reply .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 12]: `` What is the matter with you , my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 10]: I said , and drew a chair near hers .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 15]: She was half reclining , with a book lying upside down on her knee .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 24]: `` I would tell you at once , uncle , if I knew , '' she answered very sweetly , but as sadly .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 17]: I believe I am dying ; but of what I have not the smallest idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 7]: `` You 're not dying . ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 24]: `` You need not think to comfort me that way , uncle ; for I think I would rather die than not . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 9]: `` Is there anything you would like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 10]: There is nothing worth liking , but sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 9]: `` Do n't you sleep at night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 4]: `` Not well .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 11]: -- I will tell you all I know about it .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 30]: -- Some six weeks ago , I woke suddenly one morning , very early -- I think about three o'clock -- with an overpowering sense of blackness and misery .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 14]: Everything I thought of seemed to have a core of wretchedness in it .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 17]: I fought with the feeling as well as I could , and got to sleep again .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 12]: But the effect of it did not leave me next day .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 15]: I said to myself : ` They say `` morning thoughts are true . ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 14]: What if this should be the true way of looking at things ? '
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 9]: And everything became grey and dismal about me .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 8]: Next morning it was just the same .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 27]: It was as if I had waked in the middle of some chaos over which God had never said : ` Let there be light . '
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 7]: And the next day was worse .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 24]: I began to see the bad in everything -- wrong motives -- and self-love -- and pretence , and everything mean and low .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 9]: And so it has gone on ever since .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 6]: I wake wretched every morning .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 14]: I am crowded with wretched , if not wicked thoughts , all day .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 5]: Nothing seems worth anything .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 8]: I do n't care for anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 7]: `` But you love somebody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 8]: `` I hope I love my father .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 10]: I do n't feel as if I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 9]: `` And there 's your cousin Percy . ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 10]: I confess this was a feeler I put out .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 7]: `` Percy 's a fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 19]: she said , with some show of indignation , which I hailed , for more reasons than one .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 14]: `` But you enjoyed the sermon this morning , did you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 20]: I thought it very poetical and very pretty ; but whether it was true -- how could I tell ?
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 5]: I did n't care .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 10]: The baby he spoke about was nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 13]: I did n't love him , or want to hear about him .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 11]: Do n't you think me a brute , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 7]: `` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 6]: I think you are ill .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 21]: And I think we shall find something that will do you good ; but I ca n't tell yet what .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 11]: You will dine with us , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 10]: yes , if you and papa wish it . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 6]: `` Of course we do .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 16]: He is just gone to ask Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield to dine with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 10]: `` You do n't mind , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 2]: no .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 5]: They are nice people .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 6]: I like them both . ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 11]: `` Well , I will leave you , my child .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 5]: Sleep if you can .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 21]: I will go and walk in the garden , and think what can be done for my little girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 6]: `` Thank you , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 9]: But you ca n't do me any good .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 11]: What if this should be the true way of things ?
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 12]: It is better to know it , if it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 11]: `` Disease could n't make a sun in the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 16]: But it could make a man blind , that he could not see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 8]: `` I do n't understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 11]: It 's of no consequence whether you do or not .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 12]: When you see light again , you will believe in it .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 6]: For light compels faith . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 12]: `` I believe in you , uncle ; I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 7]: `` Thank you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 18]: I went round by the stables , and there found the colonel , talking to his groom .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 14]: He had returned already from his call , and the Bloomfields were coming .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 16]: I met Percy next , sauntering about , with a huge cigar in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 15]: `` The Bloomfields are coming to dinner , Mr. Percy , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 6]: `` Who are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 8]: `` The schoolmaster and his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 10]: `` Just like that precious old uncle of mine !
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 12]: Why the deuce did he ask _ me _ this Christmas ?
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 14]: I tell you what , Mr. Smith -- I ca n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 13]: There 's nothing , not even cards , to amuse a fellow .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 13]: And when my mother comes , it will be ten times worse .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 9]: I 'll cut and run for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 10]: no , you wo n't , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 7]: But I heartily wished he would .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 11]: I confess the insincerity , and am sorry for it .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 14]: `` But what the devil does my mother want , coming here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 27]: `` I have n't the pleasure of knowing your mother , so I can not tell what the devil she can want , coming here . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 4]: He walked away .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 3]: Chapter III .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 4]: The Christmas dinner .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 60]: Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield arrived ; the former a benevolent , grey-haired man , with a large nose and small mouth , yet with nothing of the foolish look which often accompanies such a malconformation ; and the latter a nice-looking little body , middle-aged , rather more ; with half-grey curls , and a cap with black ribbons .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 8]: Indeed , they were both in mourning .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 21]: Mr. Bloomfield bore himself with a kind of unworldly grace , and Mrs. Bloomfield with a kind of sweet primness .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 23]: The schoolmaster was inclined to be talkative ; nor was his wife behind him ; and that was just what we wanted .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 21]: `` I am sorry to see you in mourning , '' said the colonel to Mr. Bloomfield , during dessert .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 11]: `` I trust it is for no near relative . ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 8]: `` No relative at all , sir .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 34]: But a boy of mine , to whom , through God 's grace , I did a good turn once , and whom , as a consequence , I loved ever after . ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 14]: `` Tell Colonel Cathcart the story , James , '' said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 20]: `` It can do no harm to anybody now ; and you need n't mention names , you know .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 14]: You would like to hear it , would n't you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 10]: `` Very much indeed , '' answered the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 34]: `` Well , sir , '' began the schoolmaster , `` there 's not much in it to you , I fear ; though there was a good deal to him and me .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 10]: I was usher in a school at Peckham once .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 35]: I was but a lad , but I tried to do my duty ; and the first part of my duty seemed to me , to take care of the characters of the boys .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 21]: So I tried to understand them all , and their ways of looking at things , and thinking about them .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 27]: `` One day , to the horror of the masters , it was discovered that a watch belonging to one of the boys had been stolen .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 29]: The boy who had lost it was making a dreadful fuss about it , and declaring he would tell the police , and set them to find it .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 24]: The moment I heard of it , my suspicion fell , half by knowledge , half by instinct , upon a certain boy .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 49]: He was one of the most gentlemanly boys in the school ; but there was a look of cunning in the corner of his eye , and a look of greed in the corner of his mouth , which now and then came out clear enough to me .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 15]: Well , sir , I pondered for a few moments what I should do .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 43]: I wanted to avoid calling any attention to him ; so I contrived to make the worst of him in the Latin class -- he was not a bad scholar -- and so keep him in when the rest went to play .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 39]: As soon as they were gone , I took him into my own room , and said to him , ` Fred , my boy , you knew your lesson well enough ; but I wanted you here .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 8]: You stole Simmons 's watch . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 16]: `` You had better mention no names , Mr. Bloomfield , '' interrupted his wife .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 9]: `` I beg your pardon , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 6]: But it does n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 11]: Simmons was eaten by a tiger , ten years ago .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 20]: And I hope he agreed with him , for he never did with anybody else I ever heard of .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 9]: He was the worst boy I ever knew .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 8]: -- ` You stole Simmons 's watch .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 5]: Where is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 13]: He fell on his knees , as white as a sheet . '
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 15]: I sold it , ' he said , in a voice choked with terror .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 9]: ` God help you , my boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 5]: He burst out crying .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 8]: ` Where did you sell it ? '
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 4]: He told me .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 11]: ` Where 's the money you got for it ? '
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 22]: ` That 's all I have left , ' he answered , pulling out a small handful of shillings and halfcrowns .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 9]: ` Give it me , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 7]: He gave it me at once .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 14]: ` Now you go to your lesson , and hold your tongue . '
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 44]: I got a sovereign of my own to make up the sum -- I could ill spare it , sir , but the boy could worse spare his character -- and I hurried off to the place where he had sold the watch .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 26]: To avoid scandal , I was forced to pay the man the whole price , though I daresay an older man would have managed better .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 9]: At all events , I brought it home .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 37]: I contrived to put it in the boy 's own box , so that the whole affair should appear to have been only a trick , and then I gave the culprit a very serious talking-to .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 27]: He never did anything of the sort again , and died an honourable man and a good officer , only three months ago , in India .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 49]: A thousand times over did he repay me the money I had spent for him , and he left me this gold watch in his will -- a memorial , not so much of his fault , as of his deliverance from some of its natural consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 19]: The schoolmaster pulled out the watch as he spoke , and we all looked at it with respect .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 9]: It was a simple story and simply told .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 14]: But I was pleased to see that Adela took some interest in it .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 26]: I remembered that , as a child , she had always liked better to be told a story than to have any other amusement whatever .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 32]: And many a story I had had to coin on the spur of the moment for the satisfaction of her childish avidity for that kind of mental bull 's - eye .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 36]: When we gentlemen were left alone , and the servants had withdrawn , Mr. Bloomfield said to our host : `` I am sorry to see Miss Cathcart looking so far from well , colonel .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 10]: I hope you have good advice for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 24]: `` Dr. Wade has been attending her for some time , but I do n't think he 's doing her any good . ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 18]: `` Do n't you think it might be well to get the new doctor to see her ?
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 12]: He 's quite a remarkable man , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 15]: The young fellow that goes flying about the country in boots and breeches ? ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 12]: `` Well , I suppose that is the man I mean .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 14]: He 's not so very young though -- he 's thirty at least .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 26]: And for the boots and breeches -- I asked him once , in a joking way , whether he did not think them rather unprofessional .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 19]: But he told me he saved ever so much time in open weather by going across the country .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 31]: ` And , ' said he , ` if I can see patients sooner , and more of them , in that way , I think it is quite professional .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 37]: The other day , ' he said , ' I was sent for , and I went straight as the crow flies , and I beat a little baby only by five minutes after all . '
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 12]: Of course after that there was nothing more to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 12]: `` He has very queer notions , has n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 11]: `` Yes , he has , for a medical man .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 9]: He goes to church , for instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 10]: `` I do n't count that a fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 10]: `` Well , neither do I. Rather the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 24]: But one of the profession here says it is for the sake of being called out in the middle of the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 4]: that is stale .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 10]: I do n't think he would find that answer .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 11]: But it is a pity he is not married . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 5]: `` So it is .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 5]: I wish he were .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 12]: But that is a fault that may be remedied some day .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 44]: One thing I know about him is , that when I called him in to see one of my boarders , he sat by his bedside half an hour , watching him , and then went away without giving him any medicine . ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 10]: `` I do n't see the good of that .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 7]: What do you make of that ?
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 7]: I call it very odd . ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 18]: `` He said to me : ' I am not sure what is the matter with him .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 17]: A wrong medicine would do him more harm than the right one would do him good .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 7]: Meantime he is in no danger .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 10]: I will come and see him to-morrow morning . '
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 17]: Now I liked that , because it showed me that he was thinking over the case .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 8]: The boy was well in two days .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 6]: Not that that indicates much .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 13]: All I say is , he is not a common man . ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 11]: `` I do n't like to dismiss Dr. Wade . ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 19]: `` No ; but you must not stand on ceremony , if he is doing her no good .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 8]: You are judge enough of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 47]: I thought it best to say nothing ; but I heartily approved of all the honest gentleman said ; and I meant to use my persuasion afterwards , if necessary , to the same end ; for I liked all he told about the new doctor .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 5]: I asked his name .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 9]: `` Mr. Armstrong , '' answered the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 7]: `` Armstrong -- '' I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 12]: `` Is not that the name of the new curate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 5]: `` To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 4]: They are brothers .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 13]: Henry , the doctor , is considerably younger than the curate . ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 16]: `` Did the curate seek the appointment because the doctor was here before him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 5]: `` I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 9]: They are much attached to each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 36]: `` If he is at all equal as a doctor to what I think his brother is as a preacher , Purleybridge is a happy place to possess two such healers , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 12]: `` Well , time will show , '' returned Mr. Bloomfield .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 11]: All this time Percy sat yawning , and drinking claret .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 16]: When we joined the ladies , we found them engaged in a little gentle chat .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 11]: There was something about Mrs. Bloomfield that was very pleasing .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 11]: The chief ingredient in it was a certain quaint repose .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 63]: She looked as if her heart were at rest ; as if for her everything , was right ; as if she had a little room of her own , just to her mind , and there her soul sat , looking out through the muslin curtains of modest charity , upon the world that went hurrying and seething past her windows .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 29]: When we entered -- `` I was just beginning to tell Miss Cathcart , '' she said , `` a curious history that came under my notice once .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 16]: I do n't know if I ought though , for it is rather sad . ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 9]: I like sad stories , '' said Adela .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 25]: `` Well , there is n't much of romance in it either , but I will cut it short now the gentlemen are come .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 5]: I knew the lady .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 7]: She had been married some years .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 11]: And report said her husband was not overkind to her .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 15]: All at once she disappeared , and her husband thought the worst of her .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 17]: Knowing her as well as I did , I did not believe a word of it .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 26]: Yet it was strange that she had left her baby , her only child , of a few months , as well as her husband .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 28]: I went to see her mother directly I heard of it , and together we went to the police ; and such a search as we had !
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 27]: We traced her to a wretched lodging , where she had been for two nights , but they did not know what had become of her .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 14]: In fact , they had turned her out because she had no money .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 16]: Some information that we had , made us go to a house near Hyde Park .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 5]: We rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 19]: Who should open the door , in a neat cap and print-gown , but the poor lady herself !
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 8]: She fainted when she saw her mother .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 8]: And then the whole story came out .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 39]: Her husband was stingy , and only allowed her very small sum for housekeeping ; and perhaps she was not a very good manager , for good management is a gift , and everybody has not got it .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 49]: So she found that she could not clear off the butcher 's bills on the sum allowed her ; and she had let the debt gather and gather , till the thought of it , I believe , actually drove her out of her mind for the time .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 42]: She dared not tell her husband ; but she knew it must come out some day , and so at last , quite frantic with the thought of it , she ran away , and left her baby behind her . ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 8]: `` And what became of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 3]: asked Adela .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 12]: `` Her husband would never hear a word in her favour .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 22]: He laughed at her story in the most scornful way , and said he was too old a bird for that .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 11]: In fact , I believe he never saw her again .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 7]: She went to her mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 31]: She will have her child now , I suppose ; for I hear that the wretch of a husband , who would not let her have him , is dead .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 8]: I daresay she is happy at last .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 3]: Poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 14]: Some people would need stout hearts , and have not got them . ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 3]: Adela sighed .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 10]: This story , too , seemed to interest her .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 7]: `` What a miserable life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 17]: `` Well , Miss Cathcart , '' said the schoolmaster , `` no doubt it was .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 36]: But every life that has to be lived , can be lived ; and however impossible it may seem to the onlookers , it has its own consolations , or , at least , interests .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 26]: And I always fancy the most indispensable thing to a life is , that it should be interesting to those who have it to live .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 33]: My wife and I have come through a good deal , but the time when the life looked hardest to others , was not , probably , the least interesting to us .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 20]: It is just like reading a book : anything will do if you are taken up with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 5]: `` Very good philosophy !
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 7]: Is n't it , Adela ? ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 4]: said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 20]: Adela cast her eyes down , as if with a despairing sense of rebuke , and did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 29]: `` I wish you would tell Miss Cathcart , '' resumed the schoolmaster to his wife , `` that little story about the foolish lad you met once .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 17]: And you need not keep back the little of your own history that belongs to it .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 10]: I am sure the colonel will excuse you . ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 19]: `` I insist on hearing the whole of it , '' said the colonel , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 5]: And Mrs. Bloomfield began .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 72]: Let me say here once for all , that I can not keep the tales I tell in this volume from partaking of my own peculiarities of style , any more than I could keep the sermon free of such ; for of course I give them all at second hand ; and sometimes , where a joint was missing , I have had to supply facts as well as words .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 23]: But I have kept as near to the originals as these necessities and a certain preparation for the press would permit me .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 46]: Mrs. Bloomfield , I say , began : `` A good many years ago , now , on a warm summer evening , a friend , whom I was visiting , asked me to take a drive with her through one of the London parks .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 14]: I agreed to go , though I did not care much about it .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 21]: I had not breathed the fresh air for some weeks ; yet I felt it a great trouble to go .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 29]: I had been ill , and my husband was ill , and we had nothing to do , and we did not know what would become of us .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 7]: So I was anything but cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 52]: I _ knew _ that all was for the best , as my good husband was always telling me , but my eyes were dim and my heart was troubled , and I could not feel sure that God cared quite so much for us as he did for the lilies .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 45]: `` My friend was very cheerful , and seemed to enjoy everything ; but a kind of dreariness came over me , and I began comparing the loveliness of the summer evening with the cold misty blank that seemed to make up my future .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 7]: My wretchedness grew greater and greater .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 33]: The very colours of the flowers , the blue of the sky , the sleep of the water , seemed to push us out of the happy world that God had made .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 37]: And yet the children seemed as happy as if God were busy making , the things before their eyes , and holding out each thing , as he made it , for them to look at .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 14]: `` I should have told you that we had two children then . ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 15]: `` I did not know you had any family , '' interposed the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 8]: `` Yes , we had two then .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 18]: One of them is now in India , and the other was not long out of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 37]: -- Well , I was glad when my friend stopped the carriage , and got out with the children , to take them close to the water 's edge , and let them feed the swans .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 22]: I liked better to sit in the carriage alone -- an ungrateful creature , in the midst of causes for thankfulness .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 24]: I did not care for the beautiful things about me ; and I was not even pleased that other people should enjoy them .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 21]: I listlessly watched the well-dressed ladies that passed , and hearkened contemptuously to the drawling way in which they spoke .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 18]: So bad and proud was I , that I said in my heart , ` Thank God !
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 8]: I am not like them yet ! '
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 35]: Then came nursemaids and children ; and I did envy the servants , because they had work to do , and health to do it , and wages for it when it was done .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 12]: The carriage was standing still all this time , you know .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 20]: Then sickly-looking men passed , with still more sickly-looking wives , some of them leading a child between them .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 19]: But even their faces told of wages , and the pleasure of an evenings walk in the park .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 17]: And now I was able to thank God that they had the parks to walk in .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 31]: Then came tottering by , an old man , apparently of eighty years , leaning on the arm of his grand-daughter , I supposed -- a tidy , gentle-looking maiden .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 31]: As they passed , I heard the old man say : ` He maketh me to lie down in green pastures ; He leadeth me beside the still waters . '
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 30]: And his quiet face looked as if the fields were yet green to his eyes , and the still waters as pleasant as when he was a little child .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 31]: `` At last I caught sight of a poor lad , who was walking along very slowly , looking at a gay-coloured handkerchief which he had spread out before him .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 13]: His clothes were rather ragged , but not so ragged as old .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 11]: On his head was what we now call a wide-awake .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 33]: It was very limp and shapeless ; but some one that loved him had trimmed it with a bit of blue ribbon , the ends of which hung down on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 11]: This gave him an odd appearance even at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 15]: When he came up and I could see his face , it explained everything .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 39]: There was a constant smile about his mouth , which in itself was very sweet ; but as it had nothing to do with the rest of the countenance , the chief impression it conveyed was of idiotcy .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 26]: He came near the carriage , and stood there , watching some men who were repairing the fence which divided the road from the footpath .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 14]: His hair was almost golden , and went waving about in the wind .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 14]: His eye was very large and clear , and of a bright blue .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 8]: But it had no meaning in it .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 34]: He would have been very handsome , had there been mind in his face ; but as it was , the very regularity of his unlighted features made the sight a sadder one .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 17]: His figure was young ; but his face might have belonged to a man of sixty .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 21]: `` He opened his mouth , stuck out his under jaw , and stood staring and grinning at the men .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 27]: At last one of them stopped to take breath , and , catching sight of the lad , called out : '' ` Why , Davy !
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 6]: is that you ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 15]: ` Ya-as , it be , ' replied Davy , nodding his head . ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 18]: ` Why , Davy , it 's ever so long since I clapped eyes on ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 10]: ` Where ha ' ye been ? ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 13]: I ` aint been nowheres , as I knows on . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 16]: ` Well , if ye ` aint been nowheres , what have ye been doing ?
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 5]: Flying your kite ? '
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 19]: `` Davy shook his head sorrowfully , and at the same time kept on grinning foolishly . '' '
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 16]: I ` aint got no kite ; so I ca n't fly it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 13]: ` But you likes flyin ' kites , do n't ye ? '
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 7]: said his friend , kindly . ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 20]: ` Ya-as , ' answered Davy , nodding his head , and rubbing his hands , and laughing out .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 6]: ` Kites is such fun !
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 8]: I wish I 'd got un . '
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 25]: `` Then he looked thoughtfully , almost moodily , at the man , and said : '' ` Where 's _ your _ kite ?
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 4]: I likes kites .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 7]: Kites is friends to me . '
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 36]: `` But by this time the man had turned again to his work , and was busy driving a post into the ground ; so he paid no attention to the lad 's question . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 36]: `` Why , Mrs. Bloomfield , '' interrupted the colonel , `` I should just like you to send out with a reconnoitring party , for you seem to see everything and forget nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 31]: `` You see best and remember best what most interests you , colonel ; and besides that , I got a good rebuke to my ingratitude from that poor fellow .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 10]: So you see I had reason to remember him .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 12]: I hope I do n't tire you , Miss Cathcart . ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 10]: `` Quite the contrary , '' answered our hostess .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 17]: `` By this time , '' resumed Mrs. Bloomfield , `` another man had come up .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 33]: He had a coarse , hard-featured face ; and he tried , or pretended to try , to wheel his barrow , which was full of gravel , over Davy 's toes .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 19]: The said toes were sticking quite bare through great holes in an old pair of woman 's boots .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 9]: Then he began to tease him rather roughly .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 26]: But Davy took all his banter with just the same complacency and mirth with which he had received the kindliness of the other man . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 9]: ` How 's yer sweetheart , Davy ? '
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 4]: he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 12]: ` Quite well , thank ye , ' answered Davy . ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 8]: ` What 's her name ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 9]: I wo n't tell ye that . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 13]: ` Come now , Davy , tell us her name . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 5]: ` Noa . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 10]: ` Do n't be a fool . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 5]: I aint a fool .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 12]: But I wo n't tell you her name . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 11]: I do n't believe ye 've got e'er a sweetheart .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 6]: Come now . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 7]: I have though . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 9]: I do n't believe ye . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 4]: I have though .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 10]: I was at church with her last Sunday . '
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 32]: `` Suddenly the man , looking hard at Davy , changed his tone to one of surprise , and exclaimed : '' ` Why , boy , ye 've got whiskers !
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 12]: Ye had n't them the last time I see 'd ye .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 10]: Why , ye _ are _ set up now !
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 9]: When are ye going to begin to shave ?
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 8]: Where 's your razors ? ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 8]: Aint begun yet , ' replied Davy .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 16]: ` Shall shave some day , but I ` aint got too much yet . '
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 13]: `` As he said this , he fondled away at his whiskers .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 15]: They were few in number , but evidently of great value in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 34]: Then he began to stroke his chin , on which there was a little down visible -- more like mould in its association with his curious face than anything of more healthy significance .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 32]: After a few moments ' pause , his tormentor began again : '' ` Well , I ca n't think where ye got them whiskers as ye 're so fond of .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 9]: Do ye know where ye got them ? '
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 18]: `` Davy took out his pocket-handkerchief , spread it out before him , and stopped grinning . ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 16]: ` Yaas ; to be sure I do , ' he said at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 5]: ` Ye do ? '
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 11]: growled the man , half humorously , half scornfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 15]: ` Yaas , ' said Davy , nodding his head again and again . ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 8]: ` Did ye buy 'em ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 40]: ` Noa , ' answered Davy ; and the sweetness of the smile which he now smiled was not confined to his mouth , but broke like light , the light of intelligence , over his whole face . ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 8]: ` Were they gave to ye ? '
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 15]: pursued the man , now really curious to hear what he would say . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 22]: ` Yaas , ' said the poor fellow ; and he clapped his hands in a kind of suppressed glee . ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 10]: ` Why , who gave 'em to ye ? '
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 25]: `` Davy looked up in a way I shall never forget , and , pointing up with his finger too , said nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 7]: ` What do ye mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 8]: ` Who gave ye yer whiskers ? '
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 45]: `` Davy pointed up to the sky again ; and then , looking up with an earnest expression , which , before you saw it , you would not have thought possible to his face , said , '' ` Blessed Father . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 4]: ` Who ? '
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 5]: shouted the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 14]: ` Blessed Father , ' Davy repeated , once more pointing upwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 5]: ` Blessed Father ! '
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 13]: returned the man , in a contemptuous tone ; ` Blessed Father !
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 11]: -- I do n't know who _ that _ is .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 5]: Where does he live ?
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 9]: I never heerd on _ him _ . '
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 13]: `` Davy looked at him as if he were sorry for him .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 17]: Then going closer up to him , he said : '' ` Did n't you though ?
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 12]: He lives up there ' -- again pointing to the sky .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 7]: ` And he is so kind !
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 10]: He gives me lots o ' things . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 14]: said the man , ' I wish he 'd give me thing 's .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 12]: But you do n't look so very rich nayther . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 31]: but he gives me lots o ' things ; and he 's up there , and he gives everybody lots o ' things as likes to have 'em . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 11]: ` Well , what 's he gave you ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 23]: ` Why , he 's gave me some bread this mornin ' , and a tart last night -- he did . '
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 21]: `` And the boy nodded his head , as was his custom , to make his assertion still stronger . ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 16]: ` But you was sayin ' just now , you had n't got a kite .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 11]: Why do n't he give you one ? ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 23]: _ He 'll _ give me one fast ` nuff , ' said Davy , grinning again , and rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 14]: `` Miss Cathcart , I assure you I could have kissed the boy .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 50]: And I hope I felt some gratitude to God for giving the poor lad such trust in Him , which , it seemed to me , was better than trusting in the three-per-cents , colonel ; for you can draw upon him to no end o ' good things .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 27]: So Davy thought anyhow ; and he had got the very thing for the want of which my life was cold and sad , and discontented .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 47]: Those words , _ Blessed Father _ , and that look that turned his vacant face , like Stephen 's , into the face of an angel , because he was looking up to the same glory , were in my ears and eyes for days .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 9]: And they taught me , and comforted me .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 12]: He was the minister of God 's best gifts to me .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 10]: And to how many more , who can tell ?
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 12]: For Davy believed that God did care for his own children .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 37]: `` Davy sauntered away , and before my friend came back with the children , I had lost sight of him ; but at my request we moved on slowly till we should find him again .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 21]: Nor had we gone far , before I saw him sitting in the middle of a group of little children .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 10]: He was showing them the pictures on his pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 19]: I had one sixpence in my purse -- it was the last I had , Mr. Smith . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 13]: Here , from some impulse or other , Mrs. Bloomfield addressed me .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 64]: `` But I was n't so poor but I could borrow , and it was a small price to give for what I had got ; and so , as I was not able to leave the carriage , I asked my friend to take it to him , and tell him that Blessed Father had sent him that to buy a kite .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 29]: The expression of childish glee upon his face , and the devout God bless you , Lady , upon his tongue , were strangely but not incongruously mingled .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 40]: `` Well , it was my last sixpence then , but here I and my husband are , owing no man anything , and spending a happy Christmas Day , with many thanks to Colonel and Miss Cathcart . ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 27]: `` No , my good Madam , '' said the colonel ; `` it is we who owe you the happiest part of our Christmas Day .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 7]: Is it not , Adela ? ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 13]: `` Yes , papa , it is indeed , '' answered Adela .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 19]: Then , with some hesitation , she added , `` But do you think it was quite fair ?
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 17]: It was _ you _ , Mrs. Bloomfield , who gave the boy the sixpence . ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 13]: `` I only said God sent it , '' said Mrs. Bloomfield .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 35]: `` Besides , '' I interposed , `` the boy never doubted it ; and I think , after all , with due submission to my niece , he was the best judge . ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 19]: `` I should be only too happy to grant it , '' she answered , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 18]: `` Things might be all right if one could believe that -- thoroughly , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 27]: `` At least you will allow , '' I said , `` that this boy was not by any means so miserable as he looked . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 11]: `` Certainly , '' she answered , with hearty emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 11]: `` I think he was much to be envied . ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 11]: Here I discovered that Percy was asleep on a sofa .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 12]: Other talk followed , and the colonel was looking very thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 17]: Tea was brought in , and soon after , our visitors rose to take their leave .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 8]: `` You are not going already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 4]: said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 12]: `` If you will excuse us , '' answered the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 7]: `` We are early birds . ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 13]: `` Well , will you dine with us this day week ? ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 12]: `` With much pleasure , '' answered both in a breath .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 48]: It was clear both that the colonel liked their simple honest company , and that he saw they might do his daughter good ; for her face looked very earnest and sweet ; and the clearness that precedes rain was evident in the atmosphere of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 38]: After their departure we soon separated ; and I retired to my room full of a new idea , which I thought , if well carried out , might be of still further benefit to the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 37]: But before I went to bed , I had made a rough translation of the following hymn of Luther 's , which I have since completed -- so far at least as the following is complete .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 23]: I often find that it helps to keep good thoughts before the mind , to turn them into another shape of words .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 34]: From heaven above I come to you , To bring a story good and new : Of goodly news so much I bring -- I can not help it , I must sing .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 34]: To you a child is come this morn , A child of holy maiden born ; A little babe , so sweet and mild -- It is a joy to see the child !
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 31]: 'T is little Jesus , whom we need Us out of sadness all to lead : He will himself our Saviour be , And from all sinning set us free .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 34]: Here come the shepherds , whom we know ; Let all of us right gladsome go , To see what God to us hath given -- A gift that makes a stable heaven .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 6]: Take heed , my heart .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 3]: Be lowly .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 23]: So Thou seest him lie in manger low : That is the baby sweet and mild ; That is the little Jesus-child .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 4]: Ah , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 6]: the maker of us all !
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 25]: How hast thou grown so poor and small , That there thou liest on withered grass -- The supper of the ox and ass ?
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 32]: Were the world wider many-fold , And decked with gems and cloth of gold , ` Twere far too mean and narrow all , To make for Thee a cradle small .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 34]: Rough hay , and linen not too fine , The silk and velvet that are thine ; Yet , as they were thy kingdom great , Thou liest in them in royal state .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 36]: And this , all this , hath pleased Thee , That Thou mightst bring this truth to me : That all earth 's good , in one combined , Is nothing to Thy mighty mind .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 5]: Ah , little Jesus !
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 30]: lay thy head Down in a soft , white , little bed , That waits Thee in this heart of mine , And then this heart is always Thine .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 16]: Such gladness in my heart would make Me dance and sing for Thy sweet sake .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 16]: Glory to God in highest heaven , For He his son to us hath given !
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 3]: Chapter IV .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 4]: The new doctor .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 29]: Next forenoon , wishing to have a little private talk with my friend , I went to his room , and found him busy writing to Dr. Wade .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 56]: He consulted me on the contents of the letter , and I was heartily pleased with the kind way in which he communicated to the old gentleman the resolution he had come to , of trying whether another medical man might not be more fortunate in his attempt to treat the illness of his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 18]: `` I fear Dr. Wade will be offended , say what I like , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 39]: `` It is quite possible to be too much afraid of giving offence , '' I said ; `` But nothing can be more gentle and friendly than the way in which you have communicated the necessity . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 12]: `` Well , it is a great comfort you think so .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 12]: Will you go with me to call on Mr. Armstrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 16]: `` With much pleasure , '' I answered ; and we set out at once .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 17]: Shown into the doctor 's dining-room , I took a glance at the books lying about .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 15]: I always take advantage of such an opportunity of gaining immediate insight into character .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 36]: Let me see a man 's book-shelves , especially if they are not extensive , and I fancy I know at once , in some measure , what sort of a man the owner is .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 20]: One small bookcase in a recess of the room seemed to contain all the non-professional library of Mr. Armstrong .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 38]: I am not going to say here what books they were , or what books I like to see ; but I was greatly encouraged by the consultation of the auguries afforded by the backs of these .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 17]: I was still busy with them , when the door opened , and the doctor entered .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 15]: He was the same man whom I had seen in church looking at Adela .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 28]: He advanced in a frank manly way to the colonel , and welcomed him by name , though I believe no introduction had ever passed between them .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 14]: Then the colonel introduced me , and we were soon chatting very comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 17]: In his manner , I was glad to find that there was nothing of the professional .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 5]: I hate the professional .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 35]: I was delighted to observe , too , that what showed at a distance as a broad honest country face , revealed , on a nearer view , lines of remarkable strength and purity .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 21]: `` My daughter is very far from well , '' said the colonel , in answer to a general inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 14]: `` So I have been sorry to understand , '' the doctor rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 13]: `` Indeed , it is only too clear from her countenance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 17]: `` I want you to come and see if you can do her any good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 9]: `` Is not Dr. Wade attending her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 15]: `` I have already informed him that I meant to request your advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 35]: `` I shall be most happy to be of any service ; but -- might I suggest the most likely means of enabling me to judge whether I can be useful or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 5]: `` Most certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 19]: `` Then will you give me the opportunity of seeing her in a non - professional way first ?
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 31]: I presume , from the fact that she is able to go to church , that she can be seen at home without the formality of an express visit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 10]: `` Certainly , '' replied the colonel , heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 39]: `` Do me the favour to dine with us this evening , and , as far as that can go you will see her -- to considerable disadvantage , I fear , '' he concluded , smiling sadly .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 7]: `` Thank you ; thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 11]: If in my power , I shall not fail you .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 11]: But you must leave a margin for professional contingencies . ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 5]: That is understood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 24]: I had been watching Mr. Armstrong during this brief conversation , and the favourable impressions I had already received of him were deepened .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 22]: His fine manly vigour , and the simple honesty of his countenance , were such as became a healer of men .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 38]: It seemed altogether more likely that health might flow from such a source , than from the _ pudgey _ , flabby figure of snuff-taking Dr. Wade , whose face had no expression except a professional one .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 63]: Mr. Armstrong 's eyes looked you full in the face , as if he was determined to understand you if he could ; and there seemed to me , with my foolish way of seeing signs everywhere , something of tenderness about the droop of those long eyelashes , so that his interpretation was not likely to fail from lack of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 30]: Then there was the firm-set mouth of his brother the curate , and a forehead as broad as his , if not so high or so full of modelling .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 46]: When we had taken our leave , I said to the colonel , `` If that man 's opportunity has been equal to his qualification , I think we may have great hopes of his success in encountering this unknown disease of poor Adela . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 6]: `` God grant it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 7]: was all my friend 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 42]: When he informed Adela that he expected Mr. Henry Armstrong to dinner , she looked at him with a surprised expression , as much as to say -- `` Surely you do not mean to give me into his hands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 12]: but she only said : `` Very well , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 41]: So Mr. Armstrong came , and made himself very agreeable at dinner , talking upon all sorts of subjects , and never letting drop a single word to remind Adela that she was in the presence of a medical man .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 60]: Nor did he seem to take any notice of her more than was required by ordinary politeness ; but behavior without speciality of any sort , he drew his judgments from her general manner , and such glances as fell naturally to his share , of those that must pass between all the persons making up a small dinner-company .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 24]: This enabled him to see her as she really was , for she remained quite at such ease as her indisposition would permit .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 28]: He drank no wine at dinner , and only one glass after ; and then asked the host if he might go to the drawing - room .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 14]: `` And will you oblige me by coming with me , Mr. Smith ?
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 11]: I can see that you are at home here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 13]: Of course the colonel consented , and I was at his service .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 11]: Adela rose from her couch when we entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 22]: Mr. Armstrong went up to her gently , and said : `` Are you able to sing something , Miss Cathcart ?
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 8]: I have heard of your singing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 18]: `` I fear not , '' she answered ; `` I have not sung for months . ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 6]: `` That is a pity .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 12]: You must lose something by letting yourself get out of practice .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 10]: May I play something to you , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 19]: She gave him a quick glance that indicated some surprise , and said : `` If you please .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 7]: It will give me pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 10]: `` May I look at your music first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 4]: `` Certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 12]: He turned over all her loose music from beginning to end .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 11]: Then without a word seated himself at the grand piano .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 36]: Whether he extemporized or played from memory , I , as ignorant of music as of all other accomplishments , could not tell , but even to stupid me , what he did play spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 31]: I assure my readers that I hardly know a term in the whole musical vocabulary ; and yet I am tempted to try to describe what this music was like .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 19]: In the beginning , I heard nothing but a slow sameness , of which I was soon weary .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 12]: There was nothing like an air of any kind in it .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 20]: It seemed as if only his fingers were playing , and his mind had nothing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 19]: It oppressed me with a sense of the common-place , which , of all things , I hate .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 42]: At length , into the midst of it , came a few notes , like the first chirp of a sleepy bird trying to sing ; only the attempt was half a wail , which died away , and came again .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 61]: Over and over again came these few sad notes , increasing in number , fainting , despairing , and reviving again ; till at last , with a fluttering of agonized wings , as of a soul struggling up out of the purgatorial smoke , the music - bird sprang aloft , and broke into a wild but unsure jubilation .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 50]: Then , as if in the exuberance of its rejoicing it had broken some law of the kingdom of harmony , it sank , plumb-down , into the purifying fires again ; where the old wailing , and the old struggle began , but with increased vehemence and aspiration .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 25]: By degrees , the surrounding confusion and distress melted away into forms of harmony , which sustained the mounting cry of longing and prayer .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 10]: Then all the cry vanished in a jubilant praise .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 89]: Stronger and broader grew the fundamental harmony , and bore aloft the thanksgiving ; which , at length , exhausted by its own utterance , sank peacefully , like a summer sunset , into a grey twilight of calm , with the songs of the summer birds dropping asleep one by one ; till , at last , only one was left to sing the sweetest prayer for all , before he , too , tucked his head under his wing , and yielded to the restoring silence .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 5]: Then followed a pause .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 5]: I glanced at Adela .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 5]: She was quietly weeping .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 9]: But he did not leave the instrument yet .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 37]: A few notes , as of the first distress , awoke ; and then a fine manly voice arose , singing the following song , accompanied by something like the same music he had already played .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 62]: It was the same feelings put into words ; or , at least , something like the same feelings , for I am a poor interpreter of music : Rejoice , said the sun , I will make thee gay With glory , and gladness , and holiday ; I am dumb , O man , and I need thy voice .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 6]: But man would not rejoice .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 17]: Rejoice in thyself said he , O sun ; For thou thy daily course dost run .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 19]: In thy lofty place , rejoice if thou can : For me , I am only a man .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 22]: Rejoice , said the wind , I am free and strong ; I will wake in thy heart an ancient song .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 7]: In the bowing woods -- hark !
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 4]: hear my voice !
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 6]: But man would not rejoice .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 18]: Rejoice , O wind , in thy strength , said he , For thou fulfillest thy destiny .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 19]: Shake the trees , and the faint flowers fan : For me , I am only a man .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 32]: I am here , said the night , with moon and star ; The sun and the wind are gone afar ; I am here with rest and dreams of choice .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 6]: But man would not rejoice .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 22]: For he said -- What is rest to me , I pray , Who have done no labour all the day ?
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 9]: He only should dream who has truth behind .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 6]: for me and my kind !
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 35]: Then a voice , that came not from moon nor star , From the sun , nor the roving wind afar , Said , Man , I am with thee -- rejoice , rejoice !
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 8]: And man said , I will rejoice !
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 7]: `` A wonderful physician this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 5]: thought I to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 24]: `` He must be a follower of some of the old mystics of the profession , counting harmony and health all one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 28]: He sat still , for a few moments , before the instrument , perhaps to compose his countenance , and then rose and turned to the company .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 10]: The colonel and Percy had entered by this time .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 27]: The traces of tears were evident on Adela 's face , and Percy was eyeing first her and then Armstrong , with some signs of disquietude .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 27]: Even during dinner it had been clear to me that Percy did not like the doctor , and now he was as evidently jealous of him .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 13]: A little general conversation ensued , and the doctor took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 8]: The colonel followed him to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 15]: I would gladly have done so too , but I remained in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 27]: All that passed between them was : `` Will you oblige me by calling on Sunday morning , half an hour before church-time , colonel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 5]: `` With pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 10]: `` Will you come with me , Smith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 11]: asked my friend , after informing me of the arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 13]: `` Do n't you think I might be in the way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 7]: I am getting old and stupid .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 12]: I should like you to come and take care of me .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 12]: He wo n't do Adela any good , I fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 8]: `` Why do you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 10]: `` He has a depressing effect on her already .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 8]: She is sure not to like him .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 13]: She was crying when I came into the room after dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 25]: `` Tears are not grief , '' I answered ; `` nor only the signs of grief , when they do indicate its presence .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 9]: They are a relief to it as well .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 23]: But I can not help thinking there was some pleasure mingled with those tears , for he had been playing very delightfully .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 9]: He must be a very gifted man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 9]: `` I do n't know anything about that .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 9]: You know I have no ear for music .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 10]: -- That wo n't cure my child anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 6]: `` It may help . ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 18]: `` Do you mean to say he thinks to cure her by playing the piano to her ?
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 15]: If he thinks to come here and do that , he is mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 18]: `` You forget , Cathcart , that I have had no more conversation with him than yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 14]: But surely you have seen no reason to quarrel with him already . ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 9]: `` No , no , my dear fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 11]: I do believe I am getting a crusty old curmudgeon .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 11]: I ca n't bear to see Adela like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 25]: `` Well , I confess , I have hopes from the new doctor ; but we will see what he says on Sunday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 10]: `` Why should we not have called to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 7]: `` I ca n't answer that .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 12]: I presume he wants time to think about the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 21]: `` And meantime he may break his neck over some gate that he ca n't or wo n't open . ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 9]: `` Well , I should be sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 11]: `` But what 's to become of us then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 4]: you allow that ?
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 9]: Then you do expect something of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 30]: `` To be sure I do , only I am afraid of making a fool of myself , and that sets me grumbling at him , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 19]: Next day was Saturday ; and Mrs. Cathcart , Percy 's mother , was expected in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 21]: I had a long walk in the morning , and after that remained in my own room till dinner time .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 32]: I confess I was prejudiced against her ; and just because I was prejudiced , I resolved to do all I could to like her , especially as it was Christmas-tide .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 29]: Not that one time is not as good as another for loving your neighbour , but if ever one is reminded of the duty , it is then .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 38]: I schooled myself all I could , and went into the drawing-room like a boy trying to be good ; as a means to which end , I put on as pleasant a face as would come .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 8]: But my good resolutions were sorely tried .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 21]: * * * * * These asterisks indicate the obliteration of the personal description which I had given of her .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 7]: Though true , it was ill-natured .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 35]: And besides , so indefinite is all description of this kind , that it is quite possible it might be exactly like some woman to whom I am utterly unworthy to hold a candle .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 11]: So I wo n't tell what her features were like .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 40]: I will only say , that I am certain her late husband must have considered her a very fine woman ; and that I had an indescribable sensation in the calves of my legs when I came near her .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 71]: But then , although I believe I am considered a good-natured man , I confess to prejudices -LRB- which I commonly refuse to act upon -RRB- , and to profound dislikes , especially to certain sorts of women , which I can no more help feeling , than I can help feeling the misery that permeates the joints of my jaws when I chance to bite into a sour apple .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 12]: So my opinions about such women go for little or nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 28]: When I entered the drawing-room , I saw at once that she had established herself as protectress of Adela , and possibly as mistress of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 26]: She leaned back in her chair at a considerable angle , but without bending her spine , and her hands lay folded in her lap .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 31]: She made me a bow with her neck , without in the least altering the angle of her position , while I made her one of my most profound obeisances .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 27]: A few common-places passed between us , and then her brother-in-law leading her down to dinner , the evening passed by with politeness on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 14]: Adela did not appear to heed her presence one way or the other .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 10]: But then of late she had been very inexpressive .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 15]: Percy seemed to keep out of his mother 's way as much as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 10]: How he amused himself , I can not imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 16]: Next morning we went to call on the doctor , on our way to church .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 15]: `` Well , Mr. Armstrong , what do you think of my daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 4]: asked the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 13]: `` I do not think she is in a very bad way .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 11]: Has she had any disappointment that you know of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 5]: `` None whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 11]: `` Ah -- I have seen such a case before .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 13]: There are a good many of them amongst girls at her age .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 24]: It is as if , without any disease , life were gradually withdrawn itself -- ebbing back as it were to its source .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 16]: Whether this has a physical or a psychological cause , it is impossible to tell .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 29]: In her case , I think the later , if indeed it have not a deeper cause ; that is , if I 'm right in my hypothesis .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 25]: A few days will show me this ; and if I am wrong , I will then make a closer examination of her case .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 16]: At present it is desirable that I should not annoy her in any such way .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 35]: Now for the practical : my conviction is that the best thing that can be done for her is , to interest her in something , if possible -- no matter what it is .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 8]: Does she take pleasure in anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 10]: `` She used to be very fond of music .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 13]: But of late I have not heard her touch the piano . ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 9]: `` May I be allowed to speak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 10]: `` Most certainly , '' said both at once .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 25]: `` I have had a little talk with Miss Cathcart , and I am entirely of Mr. Armstrong 's opinion , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 29]: `` And with his permission -- I am pretty sure of my old friend 's concurrence -- I will tell you a plan I have been thinking of .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 34]: You remember , colonel , how she was more interested in the anecdotes our friend the Bloomfields told the other evening , than she has been in anything else , since I came .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 48]: It seems to me that the interest she can not find for herself , we might be able to provide for her , by telling her stories ; the course of which everyone should be at liberty to interrupt , for the introduction of any remark whatever .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 32]: If we once got her interested in anything , it seems to me , as Mr. Armstrong has already hinted , that the tide of life would begin to flow again .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 46]: She would eat better , and sleep better , and speculate less , and think less about herself -- not _ of _ herself -- I do n't mean that , colonel ; for no one could well think less of herself than she does .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 46]: And if we could amuse her in that way for a week or two , I think it would give a fair chance to any physical remedies Mr. Armstrong might think proper to try , for they act most rapidly on a system in movement .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 13]: It would be beginning from the inside , would it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 30]: `` A capital plan , '' said the doctor , who had been listening with marked approbation ; `` and I know one who I am sure would help .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 26]: For my part , I never told a story in my life , but I am willing to try -- after awhile , that is .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 36]: My brother , however , would , I know , be delighted to lend his aid to such a scheme , if colonel Cathcart would be so good as to include him in the conspiracy .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 17]: It is his duty as well as mine ; for she is one of his flock .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 19]: And he can tell a tale , real or fictitious , better than any one I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 30]: `` There can be no harm in trying it , gentlemen -- with kindest thanks to you for your interest in my poor child , '' said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 37]: `` I confess I have not much hope from such a plan , but -- '' `` You must not let her know that the thing is got up for her , '' interrupted the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 14]: You must all come and dine with us , any day you like .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 9]: I will call on your brother to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 15]: `` This Christmas-tide gives good opportunity for such a scheme , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 39]: `` It will fall in well with all the festivities ; and I am quite willing to open the entertainment with a funny kind of fairy-tale , which has been growing in my brain for some time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 4]: `` Capital ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 4]: said Mr. Armstrong .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 8]: `` We must have all sorts . ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 15]: `` Then shall it be Monday at six -- that is , to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 4]: asked the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 11]: `` Your brother wo n't mind a short invitation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 4]: Ask him to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 18]: But I would suggest five , if I might , to give us more time afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 5]: Let it be five .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 9]: And now we will go to church . ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 14]: The ends of the old oak pews next the chancel were curiously carved .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 12]: One had a ladder and a hammer and nails on it .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 20]: Another a number of round flat things , and when you counted them you found that there were thirty .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 26]: Another had a curious thing -- I could not tell what , till one day I met an old woman carrying just such a bag .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 12]: On another was a sponge on the point of a spear .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 17]: There were more of such carvings ; but these I could see from where I sat .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 26]: And all the sermon was a persuading of the people that God really loved them , without any _ if _ or _ but _ .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 40]: Adela was very attentive to the clergy man ; but I could see her glance wander now and then from his face to that of his brother , who was in the same place he had occupied on Christmas-day .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 10]: The expression of her aunt 's face was judicial .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 29]: When we came out of church , the doctor shook hands with me and said : `` Can I have a word with you , Mr. Smith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 8]: `` Most gladly , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 13]: `` Your time is precious : I will walk your way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 7]: -- I like your plan heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 20]: But to tell the truth , I fancy it is more a case for my brother than for me .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 22]: But that may come about all in good time , especially as she will now have an opportunity of knowing him .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 9]: He is the best fellow in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 10]: And his wife is as good as he is .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 32]: But -- I feel I may say to you what I could not well say to the colonel -- I suspect the cause of her illness is rather a spiritual one .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 30]: She has evidently a strong mental constitution ; and this strong frame , so to speak , has been fed upon slops ; and an atrophy is the consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 36]: My hope in your plan is , partly , that it may furnish a better mental table for her , for the time , and set her foraging in new direction for the future . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 18]: `` But how could you tell that from the very little conversation you had with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 24]: `` It was not the conversation only -- I watched everything about her ; and interpreted it by what I know about women .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 45]: I believe that many of them go into a consumption just from discontent -- the righteous discontent of a soul which is meant to sit at the Father 's table , and so can not content itself with the husks which the swine eat .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 14]: The theological nourishment which is offered them is generally no better than husks .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 17]: They can not live upon it , and so die and go home to their Father .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 28]: And without good spiritual food to keep the spiritual senses healthy and true , they can not see the thing 's about them as they really are .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 21]: They can not find interest in them , because they can not find their _ own _ place amoungst them .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 15]: There was one thing though that confirmed me in this idea about Miss Cathcart .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 40]: I looked over her music on purpose , and I did not find one song that rose above the level of the drawing-room , or one piece of music that had any deep feeling or any thought in it .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 9]: Of course I judged by the composers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 13]: `` You astonish me by the truth and rapidity of your judgements .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 24]: But how did you , who like myself are a bachelor , come to know so much about the minds of women ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 24]: `` I believe in part by reading Milton , and learning from him a certain high notion about myself and my own duty .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 19]: None but a pure man can understand women -- I mean the true womanhood that is in them .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 18]: But more than to Milton am I indebted to that brother of mine you heard preach to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 12]: If ever God made a good man , he is one .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 12]: He will tell you himself that he knows what evil is .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 38]: He drank of the cup , found it full of thirst and bitterness ; cast it from him , and turning to the fountain of life , kneeled and drank , and rose up a gracious giant .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 8]: I say the last -- not he .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 22]: But this brother kept me out of the mire in which he soiled his own garments , though , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 6]: they are clean enough now .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 11]: Forgive my enthusiasm , Mr. Smith , about my brother .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 7]: He is worthy of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 25]: I felt the wind cold to my weak eyes , and did not answer for some time , lest he should draw unfair conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 11]: `` You should get him to tell you his story .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 28]: It is well worth hearing ; and as I see we shall be friends all , I would rather you heard it from his own mouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 16]: `` I sincerely hope I may call that man my friend , some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 7]: `` You may do so already .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 12]: He was greatly taken with you on the journey down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 12]: `` A mutual attraction then , I am happy to think .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 11]: Good-bye , I am glad you like my plan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 6]: `` I think it excellent .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 7]: Anything hearty will do her good .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 14]: Is n't there any young man to fall in love with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 11]: `` I do n't know of any at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 21]: `` Only the _ best _ thing will make her well ; but all true things tend to healing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 24]: `` But how is it that you have such notions -- so different from those of the mass of your professional brethren ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 29]: said he , laughing , `` if you really want an answer , be it known to all men that I am a student of Van Helmont . ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 27]: He turned away , laughing ; and I , knowing nothing of Van Helmont , could not tell whether he was in jest or in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 16]: At dinner some remark was made about the sermon , I think by our host .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 10]: `` You do n't call that the gospel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 8]: said Mrs. Cathcart , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 12]: `` Why , what do you call it , Jane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 16]: `` I do n't know that I am bound to put a name upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 10]: I should , however , call it pantheism . ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 17]: `` Might I ask you , madam , what you understand by _ pantheism _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 10]: neology , and all that sort of thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 7]: `` And neology is -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 22]: `` Really , Mr. Smith , a dinner-table is not the most suitable place in the world for theological discussion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 19]: `` I quite agree with you , madam , '' I responded , astonished at my own boldness .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 28]: -- I was not quite so much afraid of her after this , although I had an instinctive sense that she did not at all like me .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 16]: But Percy was delighted to see his mother discomfited , and laughed into his plate .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 20]: She regarded him with lurid eyes for a moment , and then took refuge in her plate in turn .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 35]: The colonel was too polite to make any remark at the time , but when he and I were alone , he said : `` Smith , I did n't expect it of you .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 6]: Bravo , my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 11]: And I , John Smith , felt myself a hero .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 3]: Chapter V .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 4]: The light princess .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 18]: Five o'clock , anxiously expected by me , came , and with it the announcement of dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 28]: I think those of us who were in the secret would have hurried over it , but with Beeves hanging upon our wheels , we could not .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 27]: However , at length we were all in the drawing-room , the ladies of the house evidently surprised that we had come up stairs so soon .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 33]: Besides the curate , with his wife and brother , our party comprised our old friends , Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield , whose previous engagement had been advanced by a few days .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 46]: When we were all seated , I began , as if it were quite a private suggestion of my own : `` Adela , if you and our friends have no objection , I will read you a story I have just scribbled off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 9]: `` I shall be delighted , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 21]: This was a stronger expression of content than I had yet heard her use , and I felt flattered accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 21]: `` This is Christmas-time , you know , and that is just the time for story-telling , '' I added .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 19]: `` I trust it is a story suitable to the season , '' said Mrs. Cathcart , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 38]: `` Yes , very , '' I said ; `` for it is a child 's story -- a fairy tale , namely ; though I confess I think it fitter for grown than for young children .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 8]: I hope it is funny , though .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 6]: I think it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 13]: `` So you approve of fairy-tales for children , Mr. Smith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 16]: `` Not for children alone , madam ; for everybody that can relish them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 11]: `` But not at a sacred time like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 8]: And again she smiled an insinuating smile .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 26]: `` If I thought God did not approve of fairy-tales , I would never read , not to say write one , Sunday or Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 6]: Would you , madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 6]: `` I never do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 5]: `` I feared not .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 8]: But I must begin , notwithstanding . ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 51]: The story , as I now give it , is not exactly as I read it then , because , of course , I was more anxious that it should be correct when I prepared it for the press , than when I merely read it before a few friends .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 46]: `` Once upon a time , '' I began ; but I was unexpectedly interrupted by the clergyman , who said , addressing our host : `` Will you allow me , Colonel Cathcart , to be Master of the Ceremonies for the evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 7]: `` Certainly , Mr. Armstrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 11]: `` Then I will alter the arrangement of the party .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 27]: Here , Henry -- do n't get up , Miss Cathcart -- we 'll just lift Miss Cathcart 's couch to this corner by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 6]: -- Lie still , please .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 12]: Now , Mr. Smith , you sit here in the middle .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 13]: Now , Mrs. Cathcart , here is an easy chair for you .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 9]: With my commanding officer I will not interfere .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 18]: But having such a jolly fire it was a pity not to get the good of it .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 13]: Mr. Bloomfield , here is room for you and Mrs. Bloomfield . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 9]: `` Excellently arranged , '' said our host .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 10]: `` I will sit by you , Mr. Armstrong .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 12]: Percy , wo n't you come and join the circle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 23]: `` No , thank you , uncle , '' answered Percy from a couch , `` I am more comfortable here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 22]: `` Now , Lizzie , '' said the curate to his wife , `` you sit on this stool by me .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 6]: -- Too near the fire ?
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 2]: No ?
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 4]: -- Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 12]: -- Harry , put the bottle of water near Mr. Smith .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 12]: A fellow-feeling for another fellow -- you see , Mr. Smith .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 19]: Now we 're all right , I think ; that is , if Mrs. Cathcart is comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 3]: `` Thanks .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 3]: Quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 6]: `` Then we may begin .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 5]: Now , Mr. Smith .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 11]: -- One word more : anybody may speak that likes .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 5]: Now , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 12]: So I did begin -- `` Title : THE LIGHT PRINCESS .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 10]: `` Second Title : A FAIRY-TALE WITHOUT FAIRIES . ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 8]: `` Author : JOHN SMITH , Gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 14]: `` Motto : -- ' _ Your Servant , Goody Gravity _ . '
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 8]: `` From -- SIR CHARLES GRANDISON . ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 36]: `` I must be very stupid , I fear , Mr. Smith ; but to tell the truth , _ I _ ca n't make head or tail of it , '' said Mrs. Cathcart .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 17]: `` Give me leave , madam , '' said I ; `` that is my office .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 17]: Allow me , and I hope to make both head and tail of it for you .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 20]: But let me give you first a mere general , and indeed a more applicable motto for my story .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 46]: It is this -- from no worse authority than John Milton : ` Great bards beside In sage and solemn times have sung Of turneys and of trophies hung ; Of forests and enchantments drear , Where more is meant than meets the ear . '
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 12]: `` Milton here refers to Spencer in particular , most likely .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 51]: But what distinguishes the true bard in such work is , that _ more is meant than meets the ear _ ; and although I am no bard , I should scorn to write anything that only spoke to the _ ear _ , which signifies the surface understanding . ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 9]: General silence followed , and I went on .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 5]: `` THE LIGHT PRINCESS .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 6]: `` CHAPTER I. -- WHAT !
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 3]: NO CHILDREN ?
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 29]: `` Once upon a time , so long ago , that I have quite forgotten the date , there lived a king and queen who had no children .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 38]: `` And the king said to himself : ` All the queens of my acquaintance have children , some three , some seven , an some as many as twelve ; and my queen has not one .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 5]: I feel ill-used . '
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 15]: So he made up his mind to be cross with his wife about it .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 14]: But she bore it all like a good patient queen as she was .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 8]: Then the king grew very cross indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 21]: But the queen pretended to take it all as a joke , and a very good one , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 13]: ` Why do n't you have any daughters , at least ? '
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 21]: said he , ' I do n't say sons ; that might be too much to expect . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 18]: I am sure , dear king , I am very sorry , ' said the queen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 29]: ` So you ought to be , ' retorted the king ; ` you are not going to make a virtue of _ that _ , surely . '
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 34]: `` But he was not an ill-tempered king ; and , in any matter of less moment , he would have let the queen have her own way , with all his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 10]: This , however , was an affair of state .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 6]: `` The queen smiled . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 19]: ` You must have patience with a lady , you know , dear king , ' said she .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 23]: `` She was , indeed , a very nice queen , and heartily sorry that she could not oblige the king immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 14]: `` The king tried to have patience , but he succeeded very badly .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 30]: It was more than he deserved , therefore , when , at last , the queen gave him a daughter -- as lovely a little princess as ever cried .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 9]: * * * * * `` CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 7]: -- WO N'T I , JUST ?
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 12]: `` The day drew near when the infant must be christened .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 11]: The king wrote all the invitations with his own hand .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 6]: Of course somebody was forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 19]: `` Now , it does not generally matter if somebody is forgotten , but you must mind who .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 22]: Unfortunately , the king forgot without intending it ; and the chance fell upon the Princess Makemnoit , which was awkward .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 19]: For the Princess was the king 's own sister ; and he ought not to have forgotten her .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 41]: But she had made herself so disagreeable to the old king , their father , that he had forgot her in making his will ; and so it was no wonder that her brother forgot her in writing his invitations .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 15]: But poor relations do n't do anything to keep you in mind of them .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 5]: Why do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 15]: The king could not see into the garret she lived in , could he ?
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 8]: She was a sour , spiteful creature .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 24]: The wrinkles of contempt crossed the wrinkles of peevishness , and made her face as full of wrinkles as a pat of butter .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 25]: If ever a king could be justified in forgetting anybody , this king was justified in forgetting his sister , even at a christening .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 8]: And then she was so disgracefully poor !
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 7]: She looked very odd , too .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 21]: Her forehead was as large as all the rest of her face , and projected over it like a precipice .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 11]: When she was angry , her little eyes flashed blue .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 11]: When she hated anybody , they shone yellow and green .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 46]: What they looked like when she loved anybody , I do not know ; for I never heard of her loving anybody but herself , and I do not think she could have managed that , if she had not somehow got used to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 21]: But what made it highly imprudent in the king to forget her , was -- that she was awfully clever .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 40]: In fact , she was a witch ; and when she bewitched anybody , he very soon had enough of it ; for she beat all the wicked fairies in wickedness , and all the clever ones in cleverness .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 61]: She despised all the modes we read of in history , in which offended fairies and witches have taken their revenges ; and therefore , after waiting and waiting in vain for an invitation , she made up her mind at last to go without one , and make the whole family miserable , like a princess and a philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 41]: `` She put on her best gown , went to the palace , was kindly received by the happy monarch , who forgot that he had forgotten her , and took her place in the procession to the royal chapel .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 24]: When they were all gathered about the font , she contrived to get next to it , and throw something into the water .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 18]: She maintained then a very respectful demeanour till the water was applied to the child 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 57]: But at that moment she turned round in her place three times , and muttered the following words , loud enough for those beside her to hear : ` Light of spirit , by my charms , Light of body , every part , Never weary human arms -- Only crush thy parents ' heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 28]: `` They all thought she had lost her wits , and was repeating some foolish nursery rhyme ; but a shudder went through the whole of them .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 43]: The baby , on the contrary , began to laugh and crow ; while the nurse gave a start and a smothered cry , for she thought she was struck with paralysis : she could not feel the baby in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 10]: But she clasped it tight , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 7]: `` The mischief was done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 25]: Here I came to a pause , for I found the reading somewhat nervous work , and had to make application to the water-bottle .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 3]: `` Bravo !
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 8]: Mr. Smith , '' cried the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 21]: `` A good beginning , I am sure ; for I can not see what you are driving at . ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 10]: `` I think I do , '' said Henry .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 8]: `` Do n't you , Lizzie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 12]: `` No , I do n't , '' answered Mrs. Armstrong .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 32]: `` One thing , '' said Mrs. Cathcart with a smile , not a very sweet one , but still a smile , `` one thing , I must object to .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 11]: That is , introducing church ceremonies into a fairy-tale . ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 49]: `` Why , Mrs. Cathcart , '' answered the clergyman , taking up the cudgels for me , `` do you suppose the church to be such a cross-grained old lady , that she will not allow her children to take a few gentle liberties with their mother ?
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 8]: She 's able to stand that surely .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 11]: They wo n't love her the less for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 30]: `` Besides , '' I ventured to say , `` if both church and fairy-tale belong to humanity , they may occasionally cross circles , without injury to either .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 7]: They must have something in common .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 22]: There is the _ Fairy Queen _ , and the _ Pilgrim 's Progress _ , you know , Mrs. Cathcart .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 13]: I can fancy the pope even telling his nephews a fairy-tale . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 6]: `` Ah , the pope !
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 4]: I daresay . ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 7]: `` And not the archbishop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 32]: `` I do n't think your reasoning quite correct , Mr. Smith , '' said the clergyman ; `` and I think moreover there is a real objection to that scene .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 21]: It is , that no such charm could have had any effect where holy water was employed as the medium .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 18]: In fact I doubt if the wickedness could have been wrought in a chapel at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 8]: `` I submit , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 5]: `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 15]: I hold up the four paws of my mind , and crave indulgence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 34]: `` In the name of the church , having vindicated her power over evil incantations , I permit you to proceed , '' said Mr. Armstrong , his black eyes twinkling with fun .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 9]: Mrs. Cathcart smiled , and shook her head .

Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 7]: -- SHE CA N'T BE OURS .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 13]: `` Her atrocious aunt had deprived the child of all her gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 20]: If you ask me how this was effected , I answer : In the easiest way in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 7]: She had only to destroy gravitation .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 38]: And the princess was a philosopher , and knew all the _ ins _ and _ outs _ of the laws of gravitation as well as the _ ins _ and _ outs _ of her boot-lace .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 36]: And being a witch as well , she could abrogate those laws in a moment ; or at least so clog their wheels and rust their bearings , that they would not work at all .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 17]: But we have more to do with what followed , than with how it was done .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 35]: `` The first awkwardness that resulted from this unhappy privation was , that the moment the nurse began to float the baby up and down , she flew from her arms towards the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 20]: Happily , the resistance of the air brought her ascending career to a close within a foot of it .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 19]: There she remained , horizontal as when she left her nurse 's arms , kicking and laughing amazingly .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 24]: The nurse in terror flew to the bell , and begged the footman who answered it , to bring up the house-steps directly .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 38]: Trembling in every limb , she climbed upon the steps , and had to stand upon the very top , and reach up , before she could catch the floating tail of the baby 's long clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 19]: `` When the strange fact came to be known , there was a terrible commotion in the palace .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 18]: The occasion of its discovery by the king was naturally a repetition of the nurse 's experience .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 56]: Astonished that he felt no weight when the child was laid in his arms , he began to wave her up and -- not down ; for she slowly ascended to the ceiling as before , and there remained floating in perfect comfort and satisfaction , as was testified by her peals of tiny laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 22]: The king stood staring up in speechless amazement , and trembled so that his beard shook like grass in the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 39]: At last , turning to the queen , who was just as horror-struck as himself , he said , gasping , staring , and stammering : '' ` She _ ca n't _ be ours , queen ! '
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 29]: `` Now the queen was much cleverer than the king , and had begun already to suspect that ` this effect defective came by cause . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 11]: I am sure she is ours , ' answered she .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 15]: ` But we ought to have taken better care of her at the christening .

Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 17]: `` For he was a little king with a great throne , like many other kings .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 21]: `` The throne-steps were brought , and set upon the dining-table , and John got upon the top of them .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 22]: But he could not reach the little princess , who lay like a baby-laughter-cloud in the air , exploding continuously . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 25]: ` Take the tongs , John , ' said his majesty ; and getting up on the table , he handed them to him .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 19]: `` John could reach the baby now , and the little princess was handed down by the tongs .

Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 5]: -- WHERE IS SHE ?
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 41]: `` One fine summer day , a month after these her first adventures , during which time she had been very carefully watched , the princess was lying on the bed in the queen 's own chamber , fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 31]: One of the windows was open , for it was noon , and the day so sultry that the little girl was wrapped in nothing less etherial than slumber itself .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 22]: The queen came into the room , and not observing that the baby was on the bed , opened another window .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 66]: A frolicsome fairy wind which had been watching for a chance of mischief , rushed in at the one window , and taking its way over the bed where the child was lying , caught her up , and rolling and floating her along like a piece of flue , or a dandelion-seed , carried her with it through the opposite window , and away .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 16]: The queen went down stairs , quite ignorant of the loss she had herself occasioned .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 27]: When the nurse returned , she supposed that her majesty had carried her off , and , dreading a scolding , delayed making inquiry about her .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 25]: But hearing nothing , she grew uneasy , and went at length to the queen 's boudoir , where she found her majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 12]: ` Please your majesty , shall I take the baby ? '
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 4]: said she . ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 6]: ` Where is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 5]: asked the queen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 5]: ` Please forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 8]: I know it was wrong . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 8]: said the queen , looking grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 9]: do n't frighten me , your majesty ! '
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 8]: exclaimed the nurse , clapping her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 16]: `` The queen saw that something was amiss , and fell down in a faint .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 13]: The nurse rushed about the palace , screaming , ` My baby !
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 4]: my baby ! '
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 10]: `` Every one ran to the queen 's room .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 8]: But the queen could give no orders .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 27]: They soon found out , however , that the princess was missing , and in a moment the palace was like a bee-hive in a garden .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 21]: But in a minute more the queen was brought to herself by a great shout and a clapping of hands .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 38]: They had found the princess fast asleep under a rose-bush , to which the elvish little wind-puff had carried her , finishing its mischief by shaking a shower of red rose-leaves all over the little white sleeper .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 32]: Startled by the noise the servants made , she woke ; and furious with glee , scattered the rose-leaves in all directions , like a shower of spray in the sunset .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 32]: `` She was watched more carefully after this , no doubt ; yet it would be endless to relate all the odd incidents resulting from this peculiarity of the young princess .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 31]: But there never was a baby in a house , not to say a palace , that kept a household in such constant good humour , at least below stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 21]: If it was not easy for her nurses to hold her , certainly she did not make their arms ache .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 11]: And she was so nice to play at ball with !
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 10]: There was positively no danger of letting her fall .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 26]: You might throw her down , or knock her down , or push her down , but you could n't _ let _ her down .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 31]: It is true , you might let her fly into the fire or the coal-hole , or through the window ; but none of these accidents had happened as yet .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 21]: If you heard peals of laughter resounding from some unknown region , you might be sure enough of the cause .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 36]: Going down into the kitchen , or _ the room _ , you would find Jane and Thomas , and Robert and Susan , all and sum , playing at ball with the little princess .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 16]: She was the ball herself , and did not enjoy it the less for that .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 14]: Away she went , flying from one to another , screeching with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 13]: And the servants loved the ball itself better even than the game .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 28]: But they had to take care how they threw her , for if she received an upward direction , she would never come down without being fetched .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 15]: * * * * * `` CHAPTER V. -- WHAT IS TO BE DONE ?
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 8]: `` But above stairs it was different .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 22]: One day , for instance , after breakfast , the king went into his counting-house , and counted out his money .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 8]: The operation gave him no pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 41]: ` To think , ' said he to himself , ` that every one of these gold sovereigns weighs a quarter of an ounce , and my real , live , flesh - and-blood princess weighs nothing at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 23]: `` And he hated his gold sovereigns , as they lay with a broad smile of self-satisfaction all over their yellow faces .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 13]: `` The queen was in the parlour , eating bread and honey .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 17]: But at the second mouthful , she burst out crying , and could not swallow it .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 6]: The king heard her sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 37]: Glad of anybody , but especially of his queen , to quarrel with , he clashed his gold sovereigns into his money-box , clapped his crown on his head , and rushed into the parlour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 8]: ` What is all this about ? '
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 3]: exclaimed he .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 12]: ` What are you crying for , queen ? ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 18]: I ca n't eat it , ' said the queen , looking ruefully at the honey-pot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 5]: ` No wonder ! '
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 4]: retorted the king .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 18]: ` You 've just eaten your breakfast -- two turkey eggs , and three anchovies . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 6]: that 's not it ! '
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 4]: sobbed her majesty .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 11]: ` It 's my child , my child ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 11]: ` Well , what 's the matter with your child ?
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 11]: She 's neither up the chimney nor down the draw-well .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 6]: Just hear her laughing . '
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 44]: Yet the king could not help a sigh , which he tried to turn into a cough , saying , '' ` It is a good thing to be light-hearted , I am sure , whether she be ours or not . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 27]: ` It is a bad thing to be light-headed , ' answered the queen , looking with prophetic soul , far into the future . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 15]: Tis a good thing to be light-handed , ' said the king . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 15]: Tis a bad thing to be light-fingered , ' answered the queen . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 15]: Tis a good thing to be light-footed , ' said the king . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 17]: Tis a bad thing , ' began the queen ; but the king interrupted her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 54]: ` In fact , ' said he , with the tone of one who concludes an argument in which he has had only imaginary opponents , and in which , therefore , he has come off triumphant -- ` in fact , it is a good thing altogether to be light-bodied . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 25]: ` But it is a bad thing altogether to be light-minded , ' retorted the queen , who was beginning to lose her temper .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 23]: `` This last answer quite discomfited his majesty , who turned on his heel , and betook himself to his counting-house again .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 47]: But he was not halfway towards it , when the voice of his queen overtook him : '' ` And it 's a bad thing to be light-haired , ' screamed she , determined to have more last words , now that her spirit was roused .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 27]: `` The queen 's hair was black as night ; and the king 's had been , and his daughter 's was , golden as morning .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 25]: But it was not this reflection on his hair that troubled him ; it was the double use of the word _ light _ .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 11]: For the king hated all witticisms , and punning especially .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 37]: And besides he could not tell whether the queen meant light - _ haired _ or light - _ heired _ ; for why might she not aspirate her vowels when she was ex-asperated herself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 15]: `` Now , really , '' interrupted the clergyman , `` I must protest .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 23]: Mr. Smith , you bury us under an avalanche of puns , and , I must say , not very good ones .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 20]: Now , the story , though humorous , is not of the kind to admit of such fanciful embellishment .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 27]: It reminds one rather of a burlesque at a theatre -- the lowest thing , from a literary point of view , to be found . ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 19]: `` I submit , '' was all I could answer ; for I feared that he was right .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 29]: The passage , as it now stands , is not nearly so bad as it was then , though , I confess , it is still bad enough .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 41]: `` I think , '' said Mrs. Armstrong , `` since criticism is the order of the evening , and Mr. Smith is so kind as not to mind it , that he makes the king and queen too silly .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 8]: It takes away from the reality . ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 12]: `` Right too , my dear madam , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 8]: `` The reality of a fairy-tale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 12]: said Mrs. Cathcart , as if asking a question of herself .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 43]: `` But will you grant me the justice , '' said I , `` to temper your judgments of me , if not of my story , by remembering that this is the first thing of the sort I ever attempted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 30]: `` I tell you what , '' said the doctor , `` it 's very easy to criticise , but none of you could have written it yourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 14]: `` Of course not , for my part , '' said the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 7]: Silence followed ; and I resumed .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 12]: `` He turned upon his other heel , and rejoined her .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 28]: She looked angry still , because she knew that she was guilty , or , what was much the same , knew that he thought so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 47]: ` My dear queen , ' said he , ` duplicity of any sort is exceedingly objectionable between married people , of any rank , not to say kings and queens ; and the most objectionable form it can assume is that of punning . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 19]: said the queen , ' I never made a jest , but I broke it in the making .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 11]: I am the most unfortunate woman in the world ! '
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 23]: `` She looked so rueful , that the king took her in his arms ; and they sat down to consult . ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 7]: ` Can you bear this ? '
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 5]: said the king . ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 13]: ` No , I ca n't , ' said the queen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 10]: ` Well , what 's to be done ? '
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 5]: said the king . ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 14]: ` I 'm sure I do n't know , ' said the queen .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 11]: ` But might you not try an apology ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 12]: ` To my old sister , I suppose you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 5]: said the king . ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 9]: ` Yes , ' said the queen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 13]: ` Well , I do n't mind , ' said the king .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 29]: `` So he went the next morning to the garret of the princess , and , making a very humble apology , begged her to undo the spell .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 20]: But the princess declared , with a very grave face , that she knew nothing at all about it .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 17]: Her eyes , however , shone pink , which was a sign that she was happy .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 16]: She advised the king and queen to have patience , and to mend their ways .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 5]: The king returned disconsolate .

Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 9]: ` But what if she should marry ! '
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 12]: exclaimed the king , in sudden consternation at the idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 8]: ` Well , what of that ? '

Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 13]: ` That is no business of ours , ' replied the queen .

Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 25]: Nor , thoughtless as she was , had she committed anything worse than laughter at everybody and everything , that came in her way .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 68]: When she heard that General Clanrunfort was cut to pieces with all his forces , she laughed ; when she heard that the enemy was on his way to besiege her papa 's capital , she laughed hugely ; but when she heard that the city would most likely be abandoned to the mercy of the enemy 's soldiery -- why , then , she laughed immoderately .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 11]: These were merely reports invented for the sake of experiment .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 14]: But she never could be brought to see the serious side of anything .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 16]: When her mother cried , she said : '' ` What queer faces mamma makes !

Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 38]: `` And if he tried to catch her , she glided from him in an instant , not in the least afraid of him , but thinking , it part of the game not to be caught .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 34]: With one push of her foot , she would be floating in the air above his head ; or she would go dancing backwards and forwards and sideways , like a great butterfly .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 64]: It happened several times , when her father and mother were holding a consultation about her in private , that they were interrupted by vainly repressed outbursts of laughter over their heads ; and looking up with indignation , saw her floating at full length in the air above them , whence she regarded them with the most comical appreciation of the position .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 8]: `` One day an awkward accident happened .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 21]: The princess had come out upon the lawn with one of her attendants , who held her by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 26]: Spying her father at the other side of the lawn , she snatched her hand from the maid 's , and sped across to him .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 32]: Now , when she wanted to run alone , her custom was to catch up a stone in each hand , so that she might come down again after a bound .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 38]: Whatever she wore as part of her attire had no effect in this way : even gold , when it thus became as it were a part of herself , lost all its weight for the time .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 14]: But whatever she only held in her hands , retained its downward tendency .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 34]: On this occasion she could see nothing to catch up , but a huge toad , that was walking across the lawn as if he had a hundred years to do it in .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 24]: Not knowing what disgust meant , for this was one of her peculiarities , she snatched up the toad , and bounded away .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 63]: She had almost reached her father , and he was holding out his arms to receive her , and take from her lips the kiss which hovered on them like a butterfly on a rosebud , when a puff of wind blew her aside into the arms of a young page , who had just been receiving a message from his majesty .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 28]: Now it was no great peculiarity in the princess that , once she was set a-going , it always cost her time and trouble to check herself .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 8]: On this occasion there was no time .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 12]: She _ must _ kiss -- and she kissed the page .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 29]: She did not mind it much ; for she had no shyness in her composition ; and she knew , besides , that she could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 9]: So she only laughed , like a musical-box .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 7]: The poor page fared the worst .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 57]: For the princess , trying to correct the unfortunate tendency of the kiss , put out her hands to keep her off the page ; so that , along with the kiss , he received , on the other cheek , a slap with the huge black toad , which she poked right into his eye .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 33]: He tried to laugh , too , but it resulted in a very odd contortion of countenance , which showed that there was no danger of his pluming himself on the kiss .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 11]: Indeed it is not safe to be kissed by princesses .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 24]: As for the king , his dignity was greatly hurt , and he did not speak to the page for a whole month .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 26]: `` I may here remark that it was very amusing to see her run , if her mode of progression could properly be called running .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 25]: For first she would make a bound ; then , having alighted , she would run a few steps , and make another bound .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 38]: Sometimes she would fancy she had reached the ground before she actually had , and her feet would go backwards and forwards , running upon nothing at all , like those of a chicken on its back .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 20]: Then she would laugh like the very spirit of fun ; only in her laugh there was something missing .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 11]: What it was , I find myself unable to describe .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 21]: I think it was a certain tone , depending upon the possibility of sorrow -- _ morbidezza _ , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 5]: She never smiled . ''

Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 31]: `` Do n't you see that she must have had some weight , only it was n't worth mentioning , being no greater than the ordinary weight of the atmosphere .

Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 29]: Therefore , it was only witchcraft , you know ; and the laws of that remain to be discovered -- at least so far as my knowledge goes .

Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 23]: `` Now at the head of this college were two very wise Chinese philosophers -- by name , Hum-Drum , and Kopy-Keck .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 11]: For them the king sent ; and straightway they came .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 21]: In a long speech , he communicated to them what they knew very well already -- as who did not ?
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 41]: -- namely , the peculiar condition of his daughter in relation to the globe on which she dwelt ; and requested them to consult together as to what might be the cause and probable cure of her _ infirmity _ .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 16]: The king laid stress upon the word , but failed to discover his own pun .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 16]: The queen laughed ; but Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck heard with humility and retired in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 19]: Their consultation consisted chiefly in propounding and supporting , for the thousandth time , each his favourite theories .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 33]: For the condition of the princess afforded delightful scope for the discussion of every question arising from the division of thought -- in fact of all the Metaphysics of the Chinese Empire .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 28]: But it is only justice to say that they did not altogether neglect the discussion of the practical question , _ what was to be done _ .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 12]: `` Hum-Drum was a Materialist , and Kopy-Keck was a Spiritualist .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 29]: The former was slow and sententious ; the latter was quick and flighty ; the latter had generally the first word ; the former the last . '' '
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 14]: I assert my former assertion , ' began Kopy-Keck , with a plunge .

Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 16]: The soul of the princess was one of those , and she went far astray .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 21]: She does not belong by rights to this world at all , but to some other planet , probably Mercury .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 22]: Her proclivity to her true sphere destroys all the natural influence which this orb would otherwise possess over her corporeal frame .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 6]: She cares for nothing here .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 11]: There is no relation between her and this world . ''
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 23]: ` She must therefore be taught , by the sternest compulsion , to take an interest in the earth as the earth .

Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 13]: She must begin with the Chinese Dynasty , and end with Japan .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 35]: But first of all she must study Geology , and especially the history of the extinct races of animals -- their natures , their habits , their loves , their hates , their revenges .

Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 24]: My rooted and insubvertible conviction is that the causes of the anomalies evident in the princess 's condition are strictly and solely physical .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 11]: But that is only tantamount to acknowledging that they exist .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 4]: Hear my opinion .

Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 11]: The offices of the auricles and the ventricles are subverted .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 15]: The blood is sent forth by the veins , and returns by the arteries .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 17]: Consequently it is running the wrong way through all her corporeal organism -- lungs and all .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 30]: Is it then all mysterious , seeing that such is the case , that on the other particular of gravitation as well , she should differ from normal humanity ?
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 21]: My proposal for the cure is this : `` Phlebotomize until she is reduced to the last point of safety .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 13]: Let it be effected , if necessary , in a warm bath .

Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 22]: By means of plates constructed for the purpose , place the other foot and hand under the receivers of two air-pumps .

Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 17]: ` Which would presently arrive in the form of grim Death , ' said Kopy-Keck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 18]: ` If it should , she would yet die in doing our duty , ' retorted Hum-Drum .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 26]: `` But their Majesties had too much tenderness for their volatile offspring to subject her to either of the schemes of the equally unscrupulous philosophers .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 26]: Indeed the most complete knowledge of the laws of nature would have been unserviceable in her case ; for it was impossible to classify her .

Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 7]: -- TRY A DROP OF WATER .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 15]: `` Perhaps the best thing for the princess would have been falling in love .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 26]: But how a princess who had no gravity at all , could fall into anything , is a difficulty -- perhaps _ the _ difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 29]: As for her own feelings on the subject , she did not even know that there was such a bee-hive of honey and stings to be fallen into .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 12]: And now I come to mention another curious fact about her .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 28]: `` The palace was built on the shore of the loveliest lake in the world ; and the princess loved this lake more than father or mother .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 47]: The root of this preference no doubt , although the princess did not recognize it as such -- was , that , the moment she got into it , she recovered the natural right of which she had been so wickedly deprived -- namely , gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 25]: Whether this was owing to the fact that water had been employed as the means of conveying the injury , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 21]: But it is certain that she could swim and dive like the duck that her old nurse said she was .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 15]: The way that this alleviation of her misfortune was discovered , was as follows .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 30]: One summer evening , during the carnival of the country , she had been taken upon the lake , by the king and queen , in the royal barge .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 15]: They were accompanied by many of the courtiers in a fleet of little boats .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 36]: In the middle of the lake she wanted to get into the lord chancellor 's barge , for his daughter , who was a great favourite with her , was in it with her father .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 49]: The old king rarely condescended to make light of his misfortune ; but on this occasion he happened to be in a particularly good humour ; and , as the barges approached each other , he caught up the princess to throw her into the chancellor 's barge .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 61]: He lost his balance , however , and , dropping into the bottom of the barge , lost his hold of his daughter ; not however before imparting to her the downward tendency of his own person , though in a somewhat different direction ; for , as the king fell into the boat , she fell into the water .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 13]: With a burst of delighted laughter , she disappeared in the lake .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 9]: A cry of horror ascended from the boats .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 10]: They had never seen the princess go down before .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 38]: Half the men were under water in a moment ; but they had all , one after another , come up to the surface again for breath , when -- tinkle , tinkle , babble and gush !
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 12]: came the princess 's laugh over the water from far away .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 9]: There she was , swimming like a swan .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 14]: Nor would she come out for king or queen , chancellor or daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 13]: But though she was obstinate , she seemed more sedate than usual .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 10]: Perhaps that was because a great pleasure spoils laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 33]: After this , the passion of her life was to get into the water , and she was always the better behaved and the more beautiful the more she had of it .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 33]: Summer and winter it was all the same ; only she could not stay quite so long in the water , when they had to break the ice to let her in .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 56]: Any day , from morning till evening , she might be descried -- a streak of white in the blue water -- lying as still as the shadow of a cloud , or shooting along like a dolphin ; disappearing , and coming up again far off , just where one did not expect her .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 60]: She would have been in the lake of a night too , if she could have had her way ; for the balcony of her window overhung a deep pool in it ; and through a shallow reedy passage she could have swum out into the wide wet water , and no one would have been any the wiser .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 17]: Indeed when she happened to wake in the moonlight , she could hardly resist the temptation .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 11]: But there was the sad difficulty of getting into it .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 17]: She had as great a dread of the air as some children have of the water .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 21]: For the slightest gust of wind would blow her away ; and a gust might arise in the stillest moment .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 58]: And if she gave herself a push towards the water and just failed of reaching it , her situation would be dreadfully awkward , irrespective of the wind ; for at best there she would have to remain , suspended in her nightgown , till she was seen and angled for by somebody from the window . ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 32]: if I had my gravity , ' thought she contemplating the water , ' I would flash off this balcony like a long white sea-bird , head-long into the darling wetness .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 3]: Heigh-ho ! '
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 16]: `` This was the only consideration that made her wish to be like other people .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 19]: `` Another reason for being fond of the water was that in it alone she enjoyed any freedom .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 33]: For she could not walk out without a cortege , consisting in part of a troop of light horse , for fear of the liberties which the wind might take with her .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 41]: And the king grew more apprehensive with increasing years , till at last he would not allow her to walk abroad without some twenty silken cords fastened to as many parts of her dress , and held by twenty noble-men .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 9]: Of course horseback was out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 15]: But she bade good-bye to all this ceremony when she got into the water .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 65]: So remarkable were its effects upon her , especially in restoring her for the time to the ordinary human gravity , that , strange to say , Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three years ; in the hope that , as the water did her so much good , the earth would do her yet more .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 18]: But the king had some vulgar prejudices against the experiment , and would not give his consent .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 33]: Foiled in this , they yet agreed in another recommendation ; which , seeing that the one imported his opinions from China and the other from Thibet , was very remarkable indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 53]: They said that , if water of external origin and application could be so efficacious , water from a deeper source might work a perfect cure ; in short , that , if the poor afflicted princess could by any means be made to cry , she might recover her lost gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 10]: `` But how was this to be brought about ?
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 6]: Therein lay all the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 9]: The philosophers were not wise enough for this .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 14]: To make the princess cry was as impossible as to make her weigh .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 46]: They sent for a professional beggar ; commanded him to prepare his most touching oracle of woe ; helped him , out of the court charade-box , to whatever he wanted for dressing up , and promised great rewards in the event of his success .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 7]: But it was all in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 41]: She listened to the mendicant artist 's story , and gazed at his marvellous make-up , till she could contain herself no longer , and went into the most undignified contortions for relief , shrieking , positively screeching with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 55]: `` When she had a little recovered herself , she ordered her attendants to drive him away , and not give him a single copper ; whereupon his look of mortified discomfiture wrought her punishment and his revenge , for it sent her into violent hysterics , from which she was with difficulty recovered .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 40]: `` But so anxious was the king that the suggestion should have a fair trial , that he put himself in a rage one day , and , rushing up to her room , gave her an awful whipping .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 7]: But not a tear would flow .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 16]: She looked grave , and her laughing sounded uncommonly like screaming -- that was all .

Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 16]: For what indeed could a prince do with a princess that had lost her gravity ?
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 10]: Who could tell what she might not lose next ?
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 41]: She might lose her visibility ; or her tangibility ; or , in short , the power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium ; so that he should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 10]: Of course he made no further inquiries about her .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 14]: `` One day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 21]: These forests are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers , like a sieve that keeps back the bran .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 10]: Then the princes get away to follow their fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 24]: In this they have the advantage of the princesses , who are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 11]: I wish our princesses got lost in a forest sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 50]: `` One lovely evening , after wandering about for many days , he found that he was approaching the outskirts of this forest ; for the trees had got so thin that he could see the sunset through them ; and he soon came upon a kind of heath .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 29]: Next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood ; but by this time it was getting late , and there was nobody in the fields to direct him .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 30]: `` After travelling for another hour , his horse , quite worn out with long labour and lack of food , fell , and was unable to rise again .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 8]: So he continued his journey on foot .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 30]: At length he entered another wood -- not a wild forest , but a civilized wood , through which a footpath led him to the side of a lake .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 13]: Along this path the prince pursued his way through the gathering darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 7]: Suddenly he paused , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 7]: Strange sounds came across the water .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 10]: It was , in fact , the princess laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 46]: Now , there was something odd in her laugh , as I have already hinted ; for the hatching of a real hearty laugh , requires the incubation of gravity ; and , perhaps , this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 35]: Looking over the lake , he saw something white in the water ; and , in an instant , he had torn off his tunic , kicked off his sandals , and plunged in .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 15]: He soon reached the white object , and found that it was a woman .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 35]: There was not light enough to show that she was a princess , but quite enough to show that she was a lady , for it does not want much light to see that .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 79]: `` Now , I can not tell how it came about ; -- whether she pretended to be drowning , or whether he frightened her , or caught her so as to embarrass her ; but certainly he brought her to shore in a fashion ignominious to a swimmer , and more nearly drowned than she had ever expected to be ; for the water had got into her throat as often as she had tried to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 41]: `` At the place to which he bore her , the bank was only a foot or two above the water ; so he gave her a strong lift out of the water , to lay her on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 40]: But , her gravitation ceasing the moment she left the water , away she went , up into the air , scolding and screaming : '' ` You naughty , _ naughty _ , NAUGHTY , NAUGHTY man ! '
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 14]: `` No one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 26]: -- When the prince saw her ascend , he thought he must have been bewitched , and have mistaken a great swan for a lady .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 14]: But the princess caught hold of the topmost cone upon a lofty fir .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 29]: This came off ; but she caught at another ; and , in fact , stopped herself by gathering cones , dropping them as the stalks gave way .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 15]: The prince , meantime , stood in the water , forgetting to get out .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 19]: But the princess disappearing , he scrambled on shore , and went in the direction of the tree .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 14]: He found her climbing down one of the branches , towards the stem .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 51]: But in the darkness of the wood , the prince continued in some bewilderment as to what the phenomenon could be ; until , reaching the ground , and seeing him standing there , she caught hold of him , and said : `` I 'll tell papa . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 10]: ` Oh , no , you wo n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 5]: rejoined the prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 10]: ` Yes , I will , ' she persisted .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 24]: ` What business had you to pull me down out of the water , and throw me to the bottom of the air ?
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 10]: I never did you any harm . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 14]: I am sure I did not mean to hurt you . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 20]: I do n't believe you have any brains ; and that is a worse loss than your wretched gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 5]: I pity you . '
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 20]: `` The prince now saw that he had come upon the bewitched princess , and had already offended her .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 48]: Before he could think what to say next , the princess , giving a stamp with her foot that would have sent her aloft again , but for the hold she had of his arm , said angrily : '' ` Put me up directly . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 10]: ` Put you up where , you beauty ? '
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 4]: asked the prince .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 63]: `` He had fallen in love with her , almost , already ; for her anger made her more charming than anyone else had ever beheld her ; and , as far as he could see , which certainly was not far , she had not a single fault about her , except , of course , that she had no gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 16]: A prince , however , must be incapable of judging of a princess by weight .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 27]: The loveliness of a foot , for instance , is hardly to be estimated by the depth of the impression it can make in mud ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 10]: ` Put you up where , you beauty ? '
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 5]: said the prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 9]: ` In the water , you stupid ! '
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 5]: answered the princess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 10]: ` Come , then , ' said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 48]: `` The condition of her dress , increasing her usual difficulty in walking , compelled her to cling to him ; and he could hardly persuade himself that he was not in a delightful dream , notwithstanding the torrent of musical abuse with which she overwhelmed him .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 26]: The prince being in no hurry , they reached the lake at quite another part , where the bank was twenty-five feet high at least .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 29]: When they stood at the edge , the prince , turning towards the princess , said : '' ` How am I to put you in ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 13]: ` That is your business , ' she answered , quite snappishly .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 13]: ` You took me out -- put me in again . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 26]: ` Very well , ' said the prince ; and , catching her up in his arms , he sprang with her from the rock .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 19]: The princess had just time to give one delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 42]: When they came to the surface , the princess , for a moment or two , could not even laugh , for she had gone down with such a rush , that it was with difficulty that she recovered her breath .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 17]: The moment they reached the surface -- '' ` How do you like falling in ? '
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 4]: said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 25]: `` After a few efforts , the princess panted out : '' ` Is that what you call _ falling in _ ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 20]: ` Yes , ' answered the prince , ' I should think it a very tolerable specimen . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 14]: ` It seemed to me like going up , ' rejoined she . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 16]: ` My feeling was certainly one of elevation , too , ' the prince conceded .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 30]: `` The princess did not appear to understand him , for she retorted his first question : ' `` How do _ you _ like falling in ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 25]: ` Beyond everything , ' answered he ; ` for I have fallen in with the only perfect creature I ever saw . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 17]: ` No more of that : I am tired of it , ' said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 12]: `` Perhaps she shared her father 's aversion to punning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 11]: ` Do n't you like falling in , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 5]: said the prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 19]: ` It is the most delightful fun I ever had in my life , ' answered she . '
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 5]: I never fell before .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 6]: I wish I could learn .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 18]: To think I am the only person in my father 's kingdom that ca n't fall ! '
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 11]: `` Here the poor princess looked almost sad . '' '
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 16]: I shall be most happy to fall in with you any time you like . '
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 7]: said the prince , devotedly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 7]: Perhaps it would not be proper .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 6]: But I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 19]: At all events , as we have fallen in , let us have a swim together . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 11]: ` With all my heart , ' said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 32]: `` And away they went , swimming , and diving , and floating , until at last they heard cries along the shore , and saw lights glancing in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 14]: It was now quite late , and there was no moon . '' '
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 11]: I must go home , ' said the princess . '
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 12]: I am very sorry , for this is delightful . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 10]: ` So am I , ' responded the prince .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 29]: ` But I am glad I have n't a home to go to -- at least , I do n't exactly know where it is . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 19]: I wish I had n't one either , ' rejoined the princess ; ` it is so stupid !
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 18]: I have a great mind , ' she continued , ` to play them all a trick .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 8]: Why could n't they leave me alone ?
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 13]: They wo n't trust me in the lake for a single night !
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 9]: You see where that green light is burning ?
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 8]: That is the window of my room .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 74]: Now if you would just swim there with me very quietly , and when we are all but under the balcony , give me such a push -- _ up _ you call it -- as you did a little while ago , I should be able to catch hold of the balcony , and get in at the window ; and then they may look for me till to-morrow morning ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 23]: ` With more obedience than pleasure , ' said the prince , gallantly ; and away they swam , very gently . ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 10]: ` Will you be in the lake to-morrow-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 7]: the prince ventured to ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 7]: ` To be sure I will .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 6]: I do n't think so .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 12]: Perhaps , ' -- was the princess 's somewhat strange answer .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 31]: `` But the prince was intelligent enough not to press her further ; and merely whispered , as he gave her the parting lift : ` Do n't tell . '
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 11]: The only answer the princess returned was a roguish look .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 9]: She was already a yard above his head .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 10]: The look seemed to say : ` Never fear .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 11]: It is too good fun to spoil that way . '
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 40]: `` So perfectly like other people had she been in the water , that even yet the prince could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw her ascend slowly , grasp the balcony , and disappear through the window .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 13]: He turned , almost expecting to see her still by his side .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 8]: But he was alone in the water .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 25]: So he swam away quietly , and watched the lights roving about the shore for hours after the princess was safe in her chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 26]: As soon as they disappeared , he landed in search of his tunic and sword , and , after some trouble , found them again .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 16]: Then he made the best of his way round the lake to the other side .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 43]: There the wood was wilder , and the shore steeper -- rising more immediately towards the mountains which surrounded the lake on all sides , and kept sending it messages of silvery streams from morning to night , and all night long .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 41]: He soon found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princess 's room , and where , even in the broad daylight , he would be in no danger of being discovered from the opposite shore .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 32]: It was a sort of cave in the rock , where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves , and lay down too tired for hunger to keep him awake .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 14]: All night long he dreamed that he was swimming with the princess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 16]: `` All that is very improper -- to my mind , '' said Mrs. Cathcart .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 23]: And she glanced towards the place where Percy had deposited himself , as if she were afraid of her boy 's morals .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 41]: But if she was anxious on that score , her fears must have been dispersed the same moment by an indubitable snore from the youth , who was in his favourite position -- lying at full length on a couch .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 20]: `` You must remember all this is in Fairyland , aunt , '' said Adela , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 12]: `` Nobody does what papa and mamma would not like here .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 17]: We must not judge the people in fairy tales by precisely the same conventionalities we have .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 10]: They must be good after their own fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 3]: `` Conventionalities !
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 3]: Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 4]: said Mrs. Cathcart .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 31]: `` Besides , I do n't think the princess was quite accountable , '' said I. `` You should have made her so , then , '' rejoined my critic .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 10]: wait a little , madam , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 39]: `` I think , '' said the clergyman , `` that Miss Cathcart 's defence is very tolerably sufficient ; and , in my character of Master of the Ceremonies , I order Mr. Smith to proceed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 16]: I made haste to do so , before Mrs. Cathcart should open a new battery .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 14]: * * * * * `` CHAPTER X. -- LOOK AT THE MOON .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 45]: `` Early the next morning , the prince set out to look for something to eat , which he soon found at a forester 's hut , where for many following days he was supplied with all that a brave prince could consider necessary .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 22]: And having plenty to keep him alive for the present , he would not think of wants not yet in existence .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 16]: Whenever Care intruded , this prince always bowed him out in the most princely manner .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 65]: `` When he returned from his breakfast to his watch-cave , he saw the princess already floating about in the lake , attended by the king and queen -- whom he knew by their crowns -- and a great company in lovely little boats , with canopies of all the colours of the rainbow , and flags and streamers of a great many more .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 29]: It was a very bright day , and soon the prince , burned up with the heat , began to long for the water and the cool princess .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 35]: But he had to endure till the twilight ; for the boats had provisions on board , and it was not till the sun went down , that the gay party began to vanish .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 30]: Boat after boat drew away to the shore , following that of the king and queen , till only one , apparently the princess 's own boat , remained .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 27]: But she did not want to go home even yet , and the prince thought he saw her order the boat to the shore without her .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 23]: At all events , it rowed away ; and now , of all the radiant company , only one white speck remained .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 7]: Then the prince began to sing .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 28]: `` And this was what he sang : '' ` Lady fair , Swan-white , Lift thine eyes , Banish night By the might Of thine eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 21]: Snowy arms , Oars of snow , Oar her hither , Plashing low Soft and slow , Oar her hither .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 10]: Stream behind her O'er the lake , Radiant whiteness !
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 13]: In her wake Following , following for her sake , Radiant whiteness !

Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 26]: Lap me round , Waters sad That have left her ; Make me glad , For ye had Kissed her ere ye left her . '
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 26]: `` Before he had finished his song , the princess was just under the place where he sat , and looking up to find him .

Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 10]: ` Would you like a fall , princess ? '
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 8]: said the prince , looking down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 4]: there you are !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 17]: Yes , if you please , prince , ' said the princess , looking up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 13]: ` How do you know I am a prince , princess ? '
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 5]: said the prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 18]: ` Because you are a very nice young man , prince , ' said the princess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 9]: ` Come up then , princess . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 7]: ` Fetch me , prince . '
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 27]: `` The prince took off his scarf , then his sword-belt , then his tunic , and tied them all together , and let them down .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 8]: But the line was far too short .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 26]: He unwound his turban , and added it to the rest , when it was all but long enough ; and his purse completed it .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 21]: The princess just managed to lay hold of the knot of money , and was beside him in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 18]: This rock was much higher than the other , and the splash and the dive were tremendous .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 14]: The princess was in ecstasies of delight , and their swim was delicious .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 61]: `` Night after night they met , and swam about in the dark clear lake ; where such was the prince 's delight , that -LRB- whether the princess 's way of looking at things infected him , or he was actually getting light-headed , -RRB- he often fancied that he was swimming in the sky instead of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 16]: But when he talked about being in heaven , the princess laughed at him dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 12]: `` When the moon came , she brought them fresh pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 19]: Everything looked strange and new in her light , with an old , withered , yet unfading newness .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 61]: When the moon was nearly full , one of their great delights was , to dive deep in the water , and then , turning round , look up through it at the great blot of light close above them , shimmering and trembling and wavering , spreading and contracting , seeming to melt away , and again grow solid .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 11]: Then they would shoot up through it ; and lo !
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 35]: there was the moon , far off , clear and steady and cold , and very lovely , at the bottom of a deeper and bluer lake than theirs , as the princess said .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 19]: `` The prince soon found out that while in the water the princess was very like other people .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 24]: And besides this , she was not so forward in her questions , or pert in her replies at sea as on shore .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 18]: Neither did she laugh so much ; and when she did laugh , it was more gently .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 15]: She seemed altogether more modest and maidenly in the water than out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 36]: But when the prince , who had really fallen in love when he fell in the lake , began to talk to her about love , she always turned her head towards him and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 32]: After a while she began to look puzzled , as if she were trying to understand what he meant , but could not -- revealing a notion that he meant something .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 51]: But as soon as ever she left the lake , she was so altered , that the prince said to himself : ` If I marry her , I see no help for it ; we must turn merman and mermaid , and go out to sea at once . '

Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 33]: Imagine then her consternation , when , diving with the prince one night , a sudden suspicion seized her , that the lake was not so deep as it used to be .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 9]: The prince could not imagine what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 24]: She shot to the surface , and , without a word , swam at full speed towards the higher side of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 17]: He followed , begging to know if she was ill , or what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 15]: She never turned her head , or took the smallest notice of his question .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 14]: Arrived at the shore , she coasted the rocks , with minute inspection .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 26]: But she was not able to come to a conclusion , for the moon was very small , and so she could not see well .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 28]: She turned therefore and swam home , without saying a word to explain her conduct to the prince , of whose presence she seemed no longer conscious .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 12]: He withdrew to his cave , in great perplexity and distress .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 12]: `` Next day she made many observations , which , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 4]: strengthened her fears .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 29]: She saw that the banks were too dry ; and that the grass on the shore , and the trailing plants on the rocks , were withering away .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 46]: She caused marks to be made along the borders , and examined them , day after day , in all directions of the wind ; till at last the horrible idea became a certain fact -- that the surface of the lake was slowly sinking .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 14]: `` The poor princess nearly went out of the little mind she had .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 25]: It was awful to her , to see the lake which she loved more than any living thing , lie dying before her eyes .

Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 21]: The tops of rocks that had never been seen before , began to appear far down in the clear water .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 10]: Before long , they were dry in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 35]: It was fearful to think of the mud that would lie baking and festering , full of lovely creatures dying , and ugly creatures coming to life , like the unmaking of a world .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 11]: And how hot the sun would be without any lake !
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 15]: She could not bear to swim in it , and began to pine away .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 18]: Her life seemed bound up with it ; and ever as the lake sank , she pined .

Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 24]: `` And she laughed a ferocious laugh , that made the hairs on the back of her black cat stand erect with terror .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 27]: `` Then she went to an old chest in the room , and opening it , took out what looked like a piece of dried sea-weed .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 9]: This she threw into a tub of water .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 31]: Then she threw some powder into the water , and stirred it with her bare arm , muttering over it words of hideous sound , and yet more hideous import .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 28]: Then she set the tub aside , and took from the chest a huge bunch of a hundred rusty keys , that clattered in her shaking hands .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 11]: Then she sat down and proceeded to oil them all .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 41]: Before she had finished , out from the tub , the water of which had kept on a slow motion ever since she had ceased stirring it , came the head and half the body of a huge grey snake .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 8]: But the witch did not look round .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 42]: It grew out of the tub , waving itself backwards and forwards with a slow horizontal motion , till it reached the princess , when it laid its head upon her shoulder , and gave a low hiss in her ear .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 24]: She started -- but with joy ; and seeing the head resting on her shoulder , drew it towards her and kissed it .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 17]: Then she drew it all out of the tub , and wound it round her body .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 19]: It was one of those dreadful creatures which few have ever beheld -- the White Snakes of Darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 36]: `` Then she took the keys and went down into her cellar ; and as she unlocked the door , she said to herself , '' ` This _ is _ worth living for ! '
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 30]: `` Locking the door behind her , she descended a few steps into the cellar , and crossing it , unlocked another door into a dark , narrow passage .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 14]: This also she locked behind her , and descended a few more steps .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 28]: If any one had followed the witch-princess , he would have heard her unlock exactly one hundred doors , and descend a few steps after unlocking each .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 26]: When she had unlocked the last , she entered a vast cave , the roof of which was supported by huge natural pillars of rock .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 13]: Now this roof was the underside of the bottom of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 21]: `` She then untwined the snake from her body , and held it by the tail , high above her .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 22]: The hideous creature stretched up its head towards the roof of the cavern , which it was just able to reach .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 23]: It then began to move its head backwards and forwards , with a slow oscillating motion , as if looking for something .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 51]: At the same moment , the witch began to walk round and round the cavern , coming nearer to the centre every circuit ; while the head of the snake described the same path over the roof that she did over the floor , for she held it up still .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 7]: And still it kept slowly oscillating .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 36]: Round and round the cavern they went thus , ever lessening the circuit , till , at last , the snake made a sudden dart , and clung fast to the roof with its mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 9]: ` That 's right , my beauty ! '
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 10]: cried the princess ; ` drain it dry . '
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 36]: `` She let it go , left it hanging , and sat down on a great stone , with her black cat , who had followed her all round the cave , by her side .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 11]: Then she began to knit , and mutter awful words .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 46]: The snake hung like a huge leech , sucking at the stone ; the cat stood with his back arched , and his tail like a piece of cable , looking up at the snake ; and the old woman sat and knitted and muttered .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 35]: Seven days and seven nights they sat thus ; when suddenly the serpent dropped from the roof , as if exhausted , and shrivelled up like a piece of dried sea-weed on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 24]: The witch started to her feet , picked it up , put it in her pocket , and looked up at the roof .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 16]: One drop of water was trembling on the spot where the snake had been sucking .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 17]: As soon as she saw that , she turned and fled , followed by her cat .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 48]: She shut the door in a terrible hurry , locked it , and having muttered some frightful words , sped to the next , which also she locked and muttered over ; and so with all the hundred doors , till she arrived in her own cellar .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 34]: There she sat down on the floor ready to faint , but listening with malicious delight to the rushing of the water , which she could hear distinctly through all the hundred doors .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 7]: `` But this was not enough .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 12]: Now that she had tasted revenge , she lost her patience .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 13]: Without further measures , the lake would be too long in disappearing .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 45]: So the next night , with the last shred of the dying old moon rising , she took some of the water in which she had revived the snake , put it in a bottle , and set out , accompanied by her cat .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 36]: Ere she returned , she had made the entire circuit of the lake , muttering fearful words as she crossed every stream , and casting into it some of the water out of her bottle .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 23]: When she had finished the circuit , she muttered yet again , and flung a handful of the water towards the moon .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 21]: Every spring in the country ceased to throb and bubble , dying away like the pulse of a dying man .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 20]: The next day there was no sound of falling water to be heard along the borders of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 18]: The very courses were dry ; and the mountains showed no silvery streaks down their dark sides .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 28]: And not alone had the fountains of mother Earth ceased to flow ; for all the babies throughout the country were crying dreadfully -- only without tears .

Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 6]: -- WHERE IS THE PRINCE ?
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 23]: `` Never since the night when the princess left him so abruptly , had the prince had a single interview with her .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 30]: He had seen her once or twice in the lake ; but as far as he could discover , she had not been in it any more at night .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 39]: He had sat and sung , and looked in vain for his Nereid ; while she , like a true Nereid , was wasting away with her lake , sinking as it sank , withering as it dried .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 26]: When at length he discovered the change that was taking place in the level of the water , he was in great alarm and perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 31]: He could not tell whether the lake was dying because the lady had forsaken it ; or whether the lady would not come because the lake had begun to sink .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 10]: But he resolved to know so much at least .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 19]: `` He disguised himself , and , going to the palace , requested to see the lord chamberlain .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 34]: His appearance at once gained his request ; and the lord chamberlain being a man of some insight , perceived that there was more in the prince 's solicitation than met the ear .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 18]: He felt likewise that no one could tell whence a solution of the present difficulties might arise .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 15]: So he granted the prince 's prayer to be made shoe-black to the princess .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 28]: It was rather knowing in the prince to request such an easy post ; for the princess could not possibly soil as many shoes as other princesses .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 13]: `` He soon learned all that could be told about the princess .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 45]: He went nearly distracted ; but , after roaming about the lake for days , and diving in every depth that remained , all that he could do was to put an extra-polish on the dainty pair of boots that was never called for .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 19]: `` For the princess kept her room , with the curtains drawn to shut out the dying lake .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 14]: But she could not shut it out of her mind for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 32]: It haunted her imagination so that she felt as if her lake were her soul , drying up within her , first to become mud , and then madness and death .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 21]: She brooded over the change , with all its dreadful accompaniments , till she was nearly out of her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 10]: As for the prince , she had forgotten him .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 20]: However much she had enjoyed his company in the water , she did not care for him without it .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 12]: But she seemed to have forgotten her father and mother too .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 7]: `` The lake went on sinking .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 18]: Small slimy spots began to appear , which glittered steadily amidst the changeful shine of the water .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 28]: These grew to broad patches of mud , which widened and spread , with rocks here and there , and floundering fishes and crawling eels swarming about .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 20]: The people went everywhere catching these , and looking for anything that might have been dropped into the water .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 20]: `` At length the lake was all but gone ; only a few of the deepest pools remaining unexhausted .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 29]: `` It happened one day that a party of youngsters found themselves on the brink of one of these pools , in the very centre of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 9]: It was a rocky basin of considerable depth .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 16]: Looking in , they saw at the bottom something that shone yellow in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 10]: A little boy jumped in and dived for it .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 11]: It was a plate of gold , covered with writing .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 7]: They carried it to the king .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 18]: `` On one side of it stood these words : ` Death alone from death can save .

Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 11]: But the reverse of the plate explained it a little .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 25]: Its contents amounted to this : '' _ If the lake should disappear , they must find the hole through which the water ran .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 15]: But it would be useless to try to stop it by any ordinary means .

Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 19]: `` But at the moment , up started the princess , crying , '' ` I 'm afloat !
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 5]: I 'm afloat ! '
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 11]: `` And the little boat bumped against the stone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 4]: ` Princess ! '
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 19]: repeated the prince , encouraged by seeing her wide awake , and looking eagerly at the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 9]: said she , without once looking round . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 22]: ` Your papa promised that you should look at me ; and you have n't looked at me once . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 4]: ` Did he ?
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 6]: Then I suppose I must .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 8]: But I am so sleepy ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 19]: ` Sleep then , darling , and do n't mind me , ' said the poor prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 14]: ` Really , you are very good , ' replied the princess . '
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 11]: I think I will go to sleep again . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 22]: ` Just give me a glass of wine and a biscuit , first , ' said the prince very humbly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 18]: ` With all my heart , ' said the princess , and gaped as she said it .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 35]: `` She got the wine and the biscuit , however ; and , coming nearer with them , '' ` Why , prince , ' she said , ` you do n't look well !
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 11]: Are you sure you do n't mind it ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 14]: ` Not a bit , ' answered he , feeling very faint indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 24]: ` Only , I shall die before it is of any use to you , unless I have something to eat . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 6]: ` There , then ! '
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 11]: said she , holding out the wine to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 5]: you must feed me .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 7]: I dare not move my hands .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 9]: The water would run away directly . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 5]: ` Good gracious ! '
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 22]: said the princess ; and she began at once to feed him with bits of biscuit , and sips of wine .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 19]: `` As she fed him , he contrived to kiss the tips of her fingers now and then .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 14]: She did not seem to mind it , one way or the other .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 7]: But the prince felt better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 24]: ` Now , for your own sake , princess , ' said he , ' I can not let you go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 20]: You must sit and look at me , else I shall not be able to keep up . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 44]: ` Well , I will do anything I can to oblige you , ' answered she , with condescension ; and , sitting down , she did look at him , and kept looking at him with wonderful steadiness , considering all things .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 26]: `` The sun went down , and the moon came up ; and , gush after gush , the waters were flowing over the rock .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 11]: They were up to the prince 's waist now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 12]: ` Why ca n't we go and have a swim ? '
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 4]: said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 14]: ` There seems to be water enough just about here . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 12]: I shall never swim more , ' said the prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 12]: I forgot , ' said the princess , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 17]: `` So the water grew and grew , and rose up and up on the prince .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 9]: And the princess sat and looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 7]: She fed him now and then .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 5]: The night wore on .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 6]: The waters rose and rose .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 20]: The moon rose likewise , higher and higher , and shone full on the face of the dying prince .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 9]: The water was up to his neck . ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 9]: ` Will you kiss me , princess ? '
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 17]: said he feebly at last ; for the fun was all out of him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 24]: ` Yes , I will , ' answered the princess ; and kissed him with a long , sweet , cold kiss . ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 19]: ` Now , ' said he , with a sigh of content , ' I die happy . '
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 7]: `` He did not speak again .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 16]: The princess gave him some wine for the last time : he was past eating .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 11]: Then she sat down again , and looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 6]: The water rose and rose .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 5]: It touched his chin .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 6]: It touched his lower lip .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 6]: It touched between his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 9]: He shut them hard to keep it out .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 7]: The princess began to feel strange .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 6]: It touched his upper lip .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 6]: He breathed through his nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 5]: The princess looked wild .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 5]: It covered his nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 12]: Her eyes looked scared , and shone strange in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 24]: His head fell back ; the water closed over it ; and the bubbles of his last breath bubbled up through the water .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 12]: The princess gave a shriek , and sprang into the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 26]: `` She laid hold first of one leg , then of the other , and pulled and tugged , but she could not move either .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 19]: She stopped to take breath , and that made her think that he could not get any breath .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 4]: She was frantic .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 27]: She got hold of him , and held his head above the water , which was possible now his hands were no longer on the hole .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 13]: But it was of no use , for he was past breathing .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 10]: `` Love and water brought back all her strength .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 26]: She got under the water , and pulled and pulled with her whole might , till , at last , she got one leg out .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 5]: The other easily followed .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 21]: How she got him into the boat she never could tell ; but when she did , she fainted away .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 29]: Coming to herself , she seized the oars , kept herself steady as best she could ; and rowed and rowed , though she had never rowed before .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 24]: Round rocks , and over shallows , and through mud , she rowed , till she got to the landing-stairs of the palace .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 17]: By this time her people were on the shore , for they had heard her shriek .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 30]: She made them carry the prince to her own room , and lay him in her bed , and light a fire , and send for the doctors . ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 9]: ` But the lake , your Highness ! '
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 19]: said the Chamberlain , who , roused by the noise , came in , in his night-cap . ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 9]: ` Go and drown yourself in it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 31]: `` This was the last rudeness of which the princess was ever guilty ; and one must allow that she had good cause to feel provoked with the lord chamberlain .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 15]: `` Had it been the king himself , he would have fared no better .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 10]: But both he and the queen were fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 9]: And the chamberlain went back to his bed .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 13]: So the princess and her old nurse were left with the prince .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 7]: Somehow , the doctors never came .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 15]: But the old nurse was a wise woman , and knew what to do .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 11]: `` They tried everything for a long time without success .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 29]: The princess was nearly distracted between hope and fear , but she tried on and on , one thing after another , and everything over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 25]: `` At last , when they had all but given it up , just as the sun rose , the prince opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 9]: * * * * * `` CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 6]: -- LOOK AT THE RAIN !
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 18]: `` The princess burst into a passion of tears , and _ fell _ on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 13]: There she lay for an hour , and her tears never ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 11]: All the pent-up crying of her life was spent now .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 16]: And a rain came on , such as had never been seen in that country .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 22]: The sun shone all the time , and the great drops , which fell straight to the earth , shone likewise .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 10]: The palace was in the heart of a rainbow .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 16]: It was a rain of rubies , and sapphires , and emeralds , and topazes .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 31]: The torrents poured from the mountains like molten gold ; and if it had not been for its subterraneous outlet , the lake would have overflowed and inundated the country .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 8]: It was full from shore to shore .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 10]: `` But the princess did not heed the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 8]: She lay on the floor and wept .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 16]: And this rain within doors was far more wonderful than the rain out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 25]: For when it abated a little , and she proceeded to rise , she found , to her astonishment , that she could not .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 15]: At length , after many efforts , she succeeded in getting upon her feet .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 7]: But she tumbled down again directly .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 26]: Hearing her fall , her old nurse uttered a yell of delight , and ran to her , screaming : '' ` My darling child !
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 8]: She 's found her gravity ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 8]: that 's it , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 13]: said the princess , rubbing her shoulder and her knee alternately . '
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 6]: I consider it very unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 13]: I feel as if I should be crushed to pieces . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 4]: ` Hurrah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 8]: cried the prince , from the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 19]: ` If you 're all right , princess , so am I. How 's the lake ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 9]: ` Brimful , ' answered the nurse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 9]: ` Then we 're all jolly . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 8]: ` That we are , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 6]: answered the princess , sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 13]: `` And there was rejoicing all over the country that rainy day .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 14]: Even the babies forgot their past troubles , and danced and crowed amazingly .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 13]: And the king told stories , and the queen listened to them .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 22]: And he divided the money in his box , and she the honey in her pot , to all the children .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 12]: And there was such jubilation as was never heard of before .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 12]: `` Of course the prince and princess were betrothed at once .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 18]: But the princess had to learn to walk , before they could be married with any propriety .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 23]: And this was not so easy , at her time of life , for she could walk no more than a baby .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 10]: She was always falling down and hurting herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 14]: ` Is this the gravity you used to make so much of ? '
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 10]: said she , one day , to the prince .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 17]: ` For my part , I was a great deal more comfortable without it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 10]: ` No , no ; that 's not it .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 29]: This is it , ' replied the prince , as he took her up , and carried her about like a baby , kissing her all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 7]: ` This is gravity . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 10]: ` That 's better , ' said she . '
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 9]: I do n't mind that so much . '
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 15]: `` And she smiled the sweetest , loveliest smile in the prince 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 28]: And she gave him one little kiss , in return for all his ; and he thought them overpaid , for he was beside himself with delight .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 15]: I fear she complained of her gravity more than once after this , notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 13]: `` It was a long time before she got reconciled to walking .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 23]: But the pain of learning it , was quite counterbalanced by two things , either of which would have been sufficient consolation .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 29]: The first was , that the prince himself was her teacher ; and the second , that she could tumble into the lake as often as she pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 29]: Still , she preferred to have the prince jump in with her ; and the splash they made before , was nothing to the splash they made now .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 7]: `` The lake never sank again .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 23]: In process of time , it wore the roof of the cavern quite through , and was twice as deep as before .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 28]: `` The only revenge the princess took upon her aunt , was to tread pretty hard on her gouty toe , the next time she saw her .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 48]: But she was sorry for it the very next day , when she heard that the water had undermined her house , and that it had fallen in the night , burying her in its ruins ; whence no one ever ventured to dig up her body .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 7]: There she lies to this day .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 63]: `` So the prince and princess lived and were happy ; and had crowns of gold , and clothes of cloth , and shoes of leather , and children of boys and girls , not one of whom was ever known , on the most critical occasion , to lose the smallest atom of his or her due proportion of gravity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 9]: * * * * * `` Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 4]: `` Capital ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 6]: `` Very good indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 6]: `` Quite a success ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 5]: cried my complimentary friends .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 24]: `` I do n't think the princess could have rowed , though -- without gravity , you know , '' said the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 9]: `` But she did , '' said Adela .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 11]: `` I wo n't have my uncle found fault with .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 13]: It is a very funny , and a very pretty story . ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 9]: `` What is the moral of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 18]: drawled Mrs. Cathcart , with the first syllable of _ moral _ very long and very gentle .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 20]: `` That you need not be afraid of ill-natured aunts , though they are witches , '' said Adela .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 15]: `` No , my dear ; that 's not it , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 14]: `` It is , that you need not mind forgetting your poor relations .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 11]: No harm will come of it in the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 27]: `` I think the moral is , '' said the doctor , `` that no girl is worth anything till she has cried a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 14]: Adela gave him a quick glance , and then cast her eyes down .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 11]: Whether he had looked at her I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 6]: But I should think not .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 12]: -- Neither the clergyman nor his wife had made any remark .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 5]: I turned to them .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 17]: `` I am afraid you do not approve of my poor story , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 32]: `` On the contrary , '' replied Mr. Armstrong , `` I think there is a great deal of meaning in it , to those who can see through its fairy-gates .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 11]: What do you think of it , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 29]: `` I was so pleased with the earnest parts of it , that the fun jarred upon me a little , I confess , '' said Mrs. Armstrong .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 9]: `` But I daresay that was silly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 9]: `` I think it was , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 15]: But you can afford to be silly sometimes , in a good cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 10]: `` You might have given us the wedding . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 4]: said Mrs. Bloomfield .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 10]: `` I am an old bachelor , you see .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 14]: I fear I do n't give weddings their due , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 15]: `` I do n't care for them -- in stories , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 10]: `` When will you dine with us again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 4]: asked the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 10]: `` When you please , '' answered the curate .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 6]: `` To-morrow , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 10]: `` Rather too soon that , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 9]: Who is to read the next story ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 13]: `` Why , you , of course , '' answered his brother .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 12]: `` I am at your service , '' rejoined Mr. Armstrong .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 5]: `` But to-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 29]: `` Do n't you think , Ralph , '' said his wife , `` you could read better if you followed your usual custom of dining early ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 9]: `` I am sure I should , Lizzie .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 23]: Do n't you think , Colonel Cathcart , it would be better to come in the evening , just after your dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 13]: I like to dine early , and I am a great tea-drinker .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 56]: If we might have a huge tea-kettle on the fire , and tea-pot to correspond on the table , and I , as I read my story , and the rest of the company , as they listen , might help ourselves , I think it would be very jolly , and very homely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 7]: To this the colonel readily agreed .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 18]: I heard the ladies whispering a little , and the words -- `` Very considerate indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 8]: from Mrs. Bloomfield , reached my ears .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 16]: Indeed I had thought that the colonel 's hospitality was making him forget his servants .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 32]: And I could not help laughing to think what Beeves 's face would have been like , if he had heard us all invited to dinner again , the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 11]: Whether Adela suspected us now , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 7]: She said nothing to show it .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 47]: Just before the doctor left , with his brother and sister , he went up to her , and said , in a by-the-bye sort of way : `` I am sorry to hear that you have not been quite well of late , Miss Cathcart .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 10]: You have been catching cold , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 7]: Let me feel your pulse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 20]: She gave him her wrist directly , saying : `` I feel much better to-night , thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 32]: He stood -- listening to the pulse , you would have said -- his whole attitude was so entirely that of one listening , with his eyes doing nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 41]: He stood thus for a while , without consulting his watch , looking as if the pulse had brought him into immediate communication with the troubled heart itself , and he could feel every flutter and effort which it made .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 9]: Then he took out his watch and counted .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 32]: Now that his eyes were quite safe , I saw Adela 's eyes steal up to his face , and rest there for a half a minute with a reposeful expression .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 45]: I felt that there was something healing in the very presence and touch of the man -- so full was he of health and humanity ; and I thought Adela felt that he was a good man , and one to be trusted in .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 40]: He gave her back her hand , as it were , so gently did he let it go , and said : `` I will send you something as soon as I get home , to take at once .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 10]: I presume you will go to bed soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 11]: `` I will , if you think it best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 30]: And so Mr. Henry Armstrong was , without more ado , tacitly installed as physician to Miss Adela Cathcart ; and she seemed quite content with the new arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 3]: Chapter VI .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 3]: The bell .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 55]: Before the next meeting took place , namely , after breakfast on the following morning , Percy having gone to visit the dogs , Mrs. Cathcart addressed me : `` I had something to say to my brother , Mr. Smith , but -- '' `` And you wish to be alone with him ?
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 9]: With all my heart , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 94]: `` Not at all , Mr. Smith , '' she answered , with one of her smiles , which were quite incomprehensible to me , until I hit upon the theory that she kept a stock of them for general use , as stingy old ladies keep up their half worn ribbons to make presents of to servant-maids ; `` I only wanted to know , before I made a remark to the colonel , whether Dr. Armstrong -- '' `` Mr. Armstrong lays no claim to the rank of a physician . ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 9]: `` So much the better for my argument .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 12]: But is he a friend of yours , Mr. Smith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 11]: `` Yes -- of nearly a week 's standing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 16]: `` Oh , then , I am in no danger of hurting your feelings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 18]: `` I do n't know that , '' thought I , but I did not say it .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 44]: `` Well , Colonel Cathcart -- excuse the liberty I am taking -- but surely you do not mean to dismiss Dr. Wade , and give a young man like that the charge of your daughter 's health at such a crisis . ''
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 9]: `` Dr. Wade is dismissed already , Jane .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 15]: He did her no more good than any old woman might have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 8]: `` But such a young man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 12]: `` Not so very young , '' I ventured to say .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 8]: `` He is thirty at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 23]: But the colonel was angry with her interference ; for , an impetuous man always , he had become irritable of late .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 21]: `` Jane , '' he said , `` is a man less likely to be delicate because he is young ?
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 13]: Or does a man always become more refined as he grows older ?
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 42]: For my part -- '' and here his opposition to his unpleasant sister-in-law possibly made him say more than he would otherwise have conceded -- `` I have never seen a young man whose manners and behaviour I liked better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 8]: `` Much good that will do her !
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 7]: It will only hasten the mischief .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 28]: You men are so slow to take a hint , brother ; and it is really too hard to be forced to explain one 's self always .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 23]: Do n't you see that , whether he cures her or not , he will make her fall in love with him ?
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 11]: And you wo n't relish that , I fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 11]: `` You wo n't relish it , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 13]: But may n't he fall in love with her as well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 19]: thought I ; which thought , a certain expression in the colonel 's face kept me from uttering .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 20]: I saw at once that his sister 's words had set a discord in the good man 's music .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 18]: He made no reply ; and Mrs. Cathcart saw that her arrow had gone to the feather .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 16]: I saw what she tried to conceal -- the flash of success on her face .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 13]: But she presently extinguished it , and rose and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 106]: I thought with myself that such an arrangement would be the very best thing for Adela ; and that , if the blessedness of woman lies in any way in the possession of true manhood , she , let her position in society be what it might compared with his , and let her have all the earls in the kingdom for uncles , would be a fortunate woman indeed , to marry such a man as Harry Armstrong ; -- for so much was I attracted to the man , that I already called him Harry , when I and Myself talked about him .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 13]: But I was concerned to see my old friend so much disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 45]: I hoped however that his good generous heart would right its own jarring chords before long , and that he would not spoil a chance of Adela 's recovery , however slight , by any hasty measures founded on nothing better than paternal jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 61]: I thought , indeed , he had gone too far to make that possible for some time ; but I did not know how far his internal discomfort might act upon his behaviour as host , and so interfere with the homeliness of our story-club , upon which I depended not a little for a portion of the desired result .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 10]: The motive of Mrs. Cathcart 's opposition was evident .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 19]: She was a partizan of Percy ; for Adela was a very tolerable fortune , as people say .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 50]: These thoughts went through my mind , as thoughts do , in no time at all ; and when the lady had closed the door behind her with protracted gentleness , I was ready to show my game ; in which I really considered my friend and myself partners .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 14]: `` Those women , '' I said , -LRB- women forgive me ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 34]: , with a laugh which I trust the colonel did not discover to be a forced one -- `` Those women are always thinking about falling in love and that sort of foolery .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 10]: I wonder she is n't jealous of me now !
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 18]: Well , I do love Adela better than any man will , for some weeks to come .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 16]: I 've been a sweetheart of hers ever since she was in long clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 21]: Here I tried to laugh again , and , to judge from the colonel , I verily believe I succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 22]: The cloud lightened on his face , as I made light of its cause , till at last he laughed too .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 14]: If I thought it all nonsense , why should he think it earnest ?
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 32]: So I turned the conversation to the club , about which I was more concerned than about the love-making at present , seeing the latter had positively no existence as yet .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 15]: `` Adela seemed quite to enjoy the reading last night , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 12]: `` I thought she looked very grave , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 24]: The good man had been watching her face all the time , I saw , and evidently paying no heed to the story .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 32]: I doubted if he was the better judge for this -- observing only _ ab extra _ , and without being in sympathy with her feelings as moved by the tale .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 17]: `` Now that is just what I should have wished to see , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 11]: `` We do n't want her merry all at once .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 14]: What we want is , that she should take an interest in something .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 9]: A grave face is a sign of interest .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 12]: It is all the world better than a listless face . ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 11]: `` But what good can stories do in sickness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 10]: `` That depends on the origin of the sickness .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 37]: My conviction is , that , near or far off , in ourselves , or in our ancestors -- say Adam and Eve , for comprehension 's sake -- all our ailments have a moral cause .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 28]: I think that if we were all good , disease would , in the course of generations , disappear utterly from the face of the earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 13]: `` That 's just like one of your notions , old friend !
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 3]: Rather peculiar .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 7]: Mystical , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 46]: `` But I meant to go on to say that , in Adela 's case , I believe , from conversation I have had with her , that the operation of mind on body is far more immediate than that I have hinted at . ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 26]: `` You can not mean to imply , '' said my friend , in some alarm , that Adela has anything upon her conscience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 18]: But there may be moral diseases that do not in the least imply personal wrong or fault .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 9]: They may themselves be transmitted , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 23]: Or even if such sprung wholly from present physical causes , any help given to the mind would react on those causes .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 21]: Still more would the physical ill be influenced through the mental , if the mind be the source of both .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 35]: `` Now from whatever cause , Adela is in a kind of moral atrophy , for she can not digest the food provided for her , so as to get any good of it .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 38]: Suppose a patient in a corresponding physical condition , should show a relish for anything proposed to him , would you not take it for a sign that that was just the thing to do him good ?
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 23]: And we may accept the interest Adela shows in any kind of mental pabulum provided for her , as an analogous sign .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 27]: It corresponds to relish , and is a ground for expecting some benefit to follow -- in a word , some nourishment of the spiritual life .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 27]: Relish may be called the digestion of the palate ; interest , the digestion of the inner ears ; both significant of further digestion to follow .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 42]: The food thus relished may not be the best food ; and yet it may be the best for the patient , because she feels no repugnance to it , and can digest and assimilate , as well as swallow it .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 14]: For my part , I believe in no cramming , bodily or mental .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 31]: I think nothing learned without interest , can be of the slightest after benefit ; and although the effort may comprise a moral good , it involves considerable intellectual injury .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 23]: All I have said applies with still greater force to religious teaching , though that is not definitely the question now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 23]: `` Well , Smith , I ca n't talk philosophy like you ; but what you say sounds to me like sense .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 15]: At all events , if Adela enjoys it , that is enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 9]: Will the young doctor tell stories too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 7]: I fancy he _ could _ .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 8]: But to-night we have his brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 10]: `` I shall make them welcome , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 23]: This was all I wanted of him ; and now I was impatient for the evening , and the clergyman 's tale .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 20]: The more I saw of him the better I liked him , and felt the more interest in him .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 37]: I went to church that same day , and heard him read prayers , and liked him better still ; so that I was quite hungry for the story he was going to read to us .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 10]: The evening came , and with it the company .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 118]: Arrangements , similar to those of the evening before , having been made , with some little improvements , the colonel now occupying the middle place in the half-circle , and the doctor seated , whether by chance or design , at the corner farthest from the invalid 's couch , the clergyman said , as he rolled and unrolled the manuscript in his hand : `` To explain how I came to write a story , the scene of which is in Scotland , I may be allowed to inform the company that I spent a good part of my boyhood in a town in Aberdeenshire , with my grandfather , who was a thorough Scotchman .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 77]: He had removed thither from the south , where the name is indigenous ; being indeed a descendant of that Christy , whom his father , Johnie Armstrong , standing with the rope about his neck , ready to be hanged -- or murdered , as the ballad calls it -- apostrophizes in these words : ` And God be with thee , Christy , my son , Where thou sits on thy nurse 's knee !
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 20]: But an ' thou live this hundred year , Thy father 's better thou ` lt never be . '
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 22]: But I beg your pardon , ladies and gentlemen all , for this has positively nothing to do with the story .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 17]: Only please to remember that in those days it was quite respectable to be hanged . ''
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 24]: We all agreed to this with a profusion of corroboration , except the colonel ; who , I thought , winced a little .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 18]: But presently our attention was occupied with the story , thus announced : '' _ The Bell .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 9]: A Sketch in Pen and Ink _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 37]: He read in a great , deep , musical voice , with a wealth of pathos in it -- always suppressed , yet almost too much for me in the more touching portions of the story .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 13]: `` One interruption more , '' he said , before he began .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 12]: `` I fear you will find it a sad story . ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 6]: And he looked at Adela .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 13]: I believe that he had chosen the story on the homoeopathic principle .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 17]: `` I like sad stories , '' she answered ; and he went on at once .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 4]: `` THE BELL .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 8]: `` A SKETCH IN PEN AND INK .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 46]: `` Elsie Scott had let her work fall on her knees , and her hands on her work , and was looking out of the wide , low window of her room , which was on one of the ground floors of the village street .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 52]: Through a gap in the household shrubbery of fuchsias and myrtles filling the window - sill , one passing on the foot-pavement might get a momentary glimpse of her pale face , lighted up with two blue eyes , over which some inward trouble had spread a faint , gauze-like haziness .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 34]: But almost before her thoughts had had time to wander back to this trouble , a shout of children 's voices , at the other end of the street , reached her ear .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 5]: She listened a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 29]: A shadow of displeasure and pain crossed her countenance ; and rising hastily , she betook herself to an inner apartment , and closed the door behind her .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 37]: `` Meantime the sounds drew nearer ; and by and by , an old man , whose strange appearance and dress showed that he had little capacity either for good or evil , passed the window .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 47]: His clothes were comfortable enough in quality and condition , for they were the annual gift of a benevolent lady in the neighbourhood ; but , being made to accommodate his taste , both known and traditional , they were somewhat peculiar in cut and adornment .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 69]: Both coat and trousers were of a dark grey cloth ; but the former , which , in its shape , partook of the military , had a straight collar of yellow , and narrow cuffs of the same ; while upon both sleeves , about the place where a corporal wears his stripes , was expressed , in the same yellow cloth , a somewhat singular device .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 33]: It was as close an imitation of a bell , with its tongue hanging out of its mouth , as the tailor 's skill could produce from a single piece of cloth .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 13]: The origin of the military cut of his coat was well known .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 31]: His preference for it arose in the time of the wars of the first Napoleon , when the threatened invasion of the country caused the organization of many volunteer regiments .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 44]: The martial show and exercises captivated the poor man 's fancy ; and from that time forward nothing pleased his vanity , and consequently conciliated his good will more , than to style him by his favourite title -- the _ Colonel _ .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 30]: But the badge on his arm had a deeper origin , which will be partially manifest in the course of the story -- if story it can be called .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 25]: It was , indeed , the baptism of the fool , the outward and visible sign of his relation to the infinite and unseen .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 40]: His countenance , however , although the features were not of any peculiarly low or animal type , showed no corresponding sign of the consciousness of such a relation , being as vacant as human countenance could well be .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 33]: `` The cause of Elsie 's annoyance was that the fool was annoyed ; for , he was turned his rank into scorn , and assailed him with epithets hateful to him .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 55]: Although the most harmless of creatures when let alone , he was dangerous when roused ; and now he stooped repeatedly to pick up stones and hurl them at his tormentors , who took care , while abusing him , to keep at a considerable distance , lest he should get hold of them .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 25]: Amidst the sounds of derision that followed him , might be heard the words frequently repeated -- ' _ Come hame , come hame .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 35]: _ ' But in a few minutes the noise ceased , either from the interference of some friendly inhabitant , or that the boys grew weary , and departed in search of other amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 32]: By and by , Elsie might be seen again at her work in the window ; but the cloud over her eyes was deeper , and her whole face more sad .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 43]: `` Indeed , so much did the persecution of the poor man affect her , that an onlooker would have been compelled to seek the cause in some yet deeper sympathy than that commonly felt for the oppressed , even by women .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 35]: And such a sympathy existed , strange as it may seem , between the beautiful girl -LRB- for many called her a _ bonnie lassie _ -RRB- and this ` tatter of humanity . '
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 42]: Nothing would have been farther from the thoughts of those that knew them , than the supposition of any correspondence or connection between them ; yet this sympathy sprung in part from a real similarity in their history and present condition .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 139]: `` All the facts that were known about _ Feel Jock 's _ origin were these : that seventy years ago , a man who had gone with his horse and cart some miles from the village , to fetch home a load of peat from a desolate _ moss _ , had heard , while toiling along as rough a road on as lonely a hill-side as any in Scotland , the cry of a child ; and , searching about , had found the infant , hardly wrapt in rags , and untended , as if the earth herself had just given him birth , -- that desert moor , wide and dismal , broken and watery , the only bosom for him to lie upon , and the cold , clear night-heaven his only covering .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 16]: The man had brought him home , and the parish had taken parish-care of him .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 16]: He had grown up , and proved what he now was -- almost an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 44]: Many of the townspeople were kind to him , and employed him in fetching water for them from the river and wells in the neighbourhood , paying him for his trouble in victuals , or whisky , of which he was very fond .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 54]: He seldom spoke ; and the sentences he could utter were few ; yet the tone , and even the words of his limited vocabulary , were sufficient to express gratitude and some measure of love towards those who were kind to him , and hatred of those who teased and insulted him .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 48]: He lived a life without aim , and apparently to no purpose ; in this resembling most of his more gifted fellow-men , who , with all the tools and materials needful for the building of a noble mansion , are yet content with a clay hut .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 20]: `` Elsie , on the contrary , had been born in a comfortable farmhouse , amidst homeliness and abundance .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 57]: But at a very early age , she had lost both father and mother ; not so early , however , but that she had faint memories of warm soft times on her mother 's bosom , and of refuge in her mother 's arms from the attacks of geese , and the pursuit of pigs .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 40]: Therefore , in after-times , when she looked forward to heaven , it was as much a reverting to the old heavenly times of childhood and mother 's love , as an anticipation of something yet to be revealed .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 18]: Indeed , without some such memory , how should we ever picture to ourselves a perfect rest ?
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 50]: But sometimes it would seem as if the more a heart was made capable of loving , the less it had to love ; and poor Elsie , in passing from a mother 's to a brother 's guardianship , felt a change of spiritual temperature , too keen .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 71]: He was not a bad man , or incapable of benevolence when touched by the sight of want in anything of which he would himself have felt the privation ; but he was so coarsely made , that only the purest animal necessities affected him ; and a hard word , or unfeeling speech , could never have reached the quick of his nature through the hide that enclosed it .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 45]: Elsie , on the contrary , was excessively and painfully sensitive , as if her nature constantly protended an invisible multitude of half-spiritual , half - nervous antennae , which shrunk and trembled in every current of air at all below their own temperature .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 35]: The effect of this upon her behaviour was such , that she was called odd ; and the poor girl felt that she was not like other people , yet could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 40]: Her brother , too , laughed at her without the slightest idea of the pain he occasioned , or the remotest feeling of curiosity as to what the inward and consistent causes of the outward abnormal condition might be .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 21]: Tenderness was the divine comforting she needed ; and it was altogether absent from her brother 's character and behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 50]: `` Her neighbours looked on her with some interest , but they rather shunned than courted her acquaintance ; especially after the return of certain nervous attacks , to which she had been subject in childhood , and which were again brought on by the events I must relate .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 73]: It is curious how certain diseases repel , by a kind of awe , the sympathies of the neighbours : as if , by the fact of being subject to them , the patient were removed into another realm of existence , from which , like the dead with the living , she can hold communion with those around her only partially , and with a mixture of dread pervading the intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 30]: Thus some of the deepest , purest wells of spiritual life , are , like those in old castles , choked up by the decay of the outer walls .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 73]: But what tended more than anything , perhaps , to keep up the painful unrest of her soul -LRB- for the beauty of her character was evident in the fact , that the irritation seldom reached her _ mind _ -RRB- , was a circumstance at which , in its present connection , some of my readers will smile , and others feel a shudder corresponding in kind to that of Elsie .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 42]: `` Her brother was very fond of a rather small , but ferocious-looking bull-dog , which followed close at his heels , wherever he went , with hanging head and slouching gait , never leaping or racing about like other dogs .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 14]: When in the house , he always lay under his master 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 15]: He seemed to dislike Elsie , and she felt an unspeakable repugnance to him .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 62]: Though she never mentioned her aversion , her brother easily saw it by the way in which she avoided the animal ; and attributing it entirely to fear -- which indeed had a great share in the matter -- he would cruelly aggravate it , by telling her stories of the fierce hardihood and relentless persistency of this kind of animal .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 68]: He dared not yet further increase her terror by offering to set the creature upon her , because it was doubtful whether he might be able to restrain him ; but the mental suffering which he occasioned by this heartless conduct , and for which he had no sympathy , was as severe as many bodily sufferings to which he would have been sorry to subject her .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 34]: Whenever the poor girl happened inadvertently to pass near the dog , which was seldom , a low growl made her aware of his proximity , and drove her to a quick retreat .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 20]: He was , in fact , the animal impersonation of the animal opposition which she had continually to endure .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 26]: Like chooses like ; and the bull-dog _ in _ her brother made choice of the bull-dog _ out of _ him for his companion .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 12]: So her day was one of shrinking fear and multiform discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 48]: `` But a nature capable of so much distress , must of necessity be _ capable _ of a corresponding amount of pleasure ; and in her case this was manifest in the fact , that sleep and the quiet of her own room restored her wonderfully .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 24]: If she was only let alone , a calm mood , filled with images of pleasure , soon took possession of her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 64]: `` Her acquaintance with the fool had commenced some ten years previous to the time I write of , when she was quite a little girl , and had come from the country with her brother , who , having taken a small farm close to the town , preferred residing in the town to occupying the farm-house , which was not comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 21]: She looked at first with some terror on his uncouth appearance , and with much wonderment on his strange dress .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 40]: This wonder was heightened by a conversation she overheard one day in the street , between the fool and a little pale - faced boy , who , approaching him respectfully , said , ` Weel , cornel ! '
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 6]: ` Weel , laddie ! '
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 4]: was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 10]: ` Fat dis the wow say , cornel ? '
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 8]: ` Come hame , come hame ! '
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 19]: answered the _ colonel _ , with both accent and quantity heaped on the word _ hame _ .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 17]: She heard no more , and knew not what the little she had heard , meant .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 41]: What the _ wow _ could be , she had no idea ; only , as the years passed on , the strange word became in her mind indescribably associated with the strange shape in yellow cloth on his sleeves .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 53]: Had she been a native of the town , she could not have failed to know its import , so familiar was every one with it , although the word did not belong to the local vocabulary ; but , as it was , years passed away before she discovered its meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 71]: And when , again and again , the fool , attempting to convey his gratitude for some kindness she had shown him , mumbled over the words -- _ ` The wow o ' Rivven -- the wow o ' Rivven , ' _ the wonder would return as to what could be the idea associated with them in his mind , but she made no advance towards their explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 21]: `` That , however , which most attracted her to the old man , was his persecution by the children .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 19]: They were to him what the bull-dog was to her -- the constant source of irritation and annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 32]: They could hardly hurt him , nor did he appear to dread other injury from them than insult , to which , fool though he was , he was keenly alive .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 6]: Human gad-flies that they were !
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 19]: they sometimes stung him beyond endurance , and he would curse them in the impotence of his anger .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 64]: Once or twice Elsie had been so far carried beyond her constitutional timidity , by sympathy for the distress of her friend , that she had gone out and talked to the boys , -- even scolded them , so that they slunk away ashamed , and began to stand as much in dread of her as of the clutches of their prey .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 18]: So she , gentle and timid to excess , acquired among them the reputation of a termagant .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 45]: Popular opinion among children , as among men , is often just , but as often very unjust ; for the same manifestations may proceed from opposite principles ; and , therefore , as indices to character , any mislead as often as enlighten .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 37]: `` Next door to the house in which Elsie resided , dwelt a tradesman and his wife , who kept an indefinite sort of shop , in which various kinds of goods were exposed to sale .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 49]: Their youngest son was about the same age as Elsie ; and while they were rather more than children , and less than young people , he spent many of his evenings with her , somewhat to the loss of position in his classes at the parish school .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 38]: They were , indeed , much attached to each other ; and , peculiarly constituted as Elsie was , one may imagine what kind of heavenly messenger a companion stronger than herself must have been to her .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 108]: In fact , if she could have framed the undefinable need of her child-like nature into an articulate prayer , it would have been -- ` Give me some one to love me stronger than I. ' Any love was helpful , yes , in its degree , saving to her poor troubled soul ; but the hope , as they grew older together , that the powerful , yet tender-hearted youth , really loved her , and would one day make her his wife , was like the opening of heavenly eyes of life and love in the hitherto blank and death-like face of her existence .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 16]: But nothing had been said of love , although they met and parted like lovers .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 68]: `` Doubtless if the circles of their thought and feeling had continued as now to intersect each other , there would have been no interruption to their affection ; but the time at length arrived when the old couple seeing the rest of their family comfortably settled in life , resolved to make a gentleman of the youngest ; and so sent him from school to college .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 20]: The facilities existing in Scotland for providing a professional training , enabled them to educate him as a surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 62]: He parted from Elsie with some regret ; but , far less dependent on her than she was on him , and full of the prospects of the future , he felt none of that sinking at the heart which seemed to lay her whole nature open to a fresh inroad of all the terrors and sorrows of her peculiar existence .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 7]: No correspondence took place between them .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 25]: New pursuits and relations , and the development of his tastes and judgments , entirely altered the position of poor Elsie in his memory .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 81]: Having been , during their intercourse , far less of a man than she of a woman , he had no definite idea of the place he had occupied in her regard ; and in his mind she receded into the background of the past , without his having any idea that she would suffer thereby , or that he was unjust towards her ; while , in her thoughts , his image stood in the highest and clearest relief .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 37]: It was the centre-point from which and towards which all lines radiated and converged ; and although she could not but be doubtful about the future , yet there was much hope mingled with her doubts .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 84]: `` But when , at the close of two years , he visited his native village , and she saw before her , instead of the homely youth who had left her that winter evening , one who , to her inexperienced eyes , appeared a finished gentleman , her heart sank within her , as if she had found Nature herself false in her ripening processes , destroying the beautiful promise of a former year by changing instead of developing her creations .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 10]: He spoke kindly to her , but not cordially .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 99]: To her ear the voice seemed to come from a great distance out of the past ; and while she looked upon him , that optical change passed over her vision , which all have experienced after gazing abstractedly on any object for a time : his form grew very small , and receded to an immeasurable distance ; till , her imagination mingling with the twilight haze of her senses , she seemed to see him standing far off on a hill , with the bright horizon of sunset for a back-ground to his clearly defined figure .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 39]: `` She knew no more till she found herself in bed in the dark ; and the first message that reached her from the outer world , was the infernal growl of the bull-dog from the room below .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 36]: Next day she saw her lover walking with two ladies , who would have thought it some degree of condescension to speak to her ; and he passed the house without once looking towards it .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 62]: `` One who is sufficiently possessed by the demon of nervousness to be glad of the magnetic influences of a friend 's company in a public promenade , or of a horse beneath him in passing through a churchyard , will have some faint idea of how utterly exposed and defenceless poor Elsie now felt on the crowded thoroughfare of life .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 53]: And the insensibility which had overtaken her , was not the ordinary swoon with which Nature relieves the over-strained nerves , but the return of the epileptic fits of her early childhood ; and if the condition of the poor girl had been pitiable before , it was tenfold more so now .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 23]: Yet she did not complain , but bore all in silence , though it was evident that her health was giving way .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 37]: But now , help came to her from a strange quarter ; though many might not be willing to accord the name of help to that which rather hastened than retarded the progress of her decline .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 32]: `` She had gone to spend a few of the summer days with a relative in the country , some miles from her home , if home it could be called .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 14]: One evening , towards sunset , she went out for a solitary walk .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 45]: Passing from the little garden gate , she went along a bare country road for some distance , and then , turning aside by a footpath through a thicket of low trees , she came out in a lonely little churchyard on the hill-side .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 27]: Hardly knowing whether or not she had intended to go there , she seated herself on a mound covered with long grass , one of many .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 16]: Before her stood the ruins of an old church which was taking centuries to crumble .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 15]: Little remained but the gable-wall , immensely thick , and covered with ancient ivy .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 38]: The rays of the setting sun fell on a mound at its foot , not green like the rest , but of a rich , red-brown in the rosy sunset , and evidently but newly heaped up .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 9]: Her eyes , too , rested upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 9]: Slowly the sun sank below the near horizon .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 46]: `` As the last brilliant point disappeared , the ivy darkened , and a wind arose and shook all its leaves , making them look cold and troubled ; and to Elsie 's ear came a low faint sound , as from a far-off bell .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 32]: But close beside her -- and she started and shivered at the sound -- rose a deep , monotonous , almost sepulchral voice : ' _ Come hame , come hame !
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 6]: The wow , the wow !
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 10]: _ ' `` At once she understood the whole .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 91]: She sat in the churchyard of the ancient parish church of Ruthven ; and when she lifted up her eyes , there she saw , in the half-ruined belfry , the old bell , all but hidden with ivy , which the passing wind had roused to utter one sleepy tone ; and there , beside her , stood the fool with the bell on his arm ; and to him and to her the _ wow o ' Rivven _ said , ' _ Come hame , come hame !
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 18]: _ ' Ah , what did she want in the whole universe of God but a home ?
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 137]: And though the ground beneath was hard , and the sky overhead far and boundless , and the hill-side lonely and companionless , yet somewhere within the visible , and beyond these the outer surfaces of creation , there might be a home for her ; as round the wintry house the snows lie heaped up cold and white and dreary all the long _ forenight _ , while within , beyond the closed shutters , and giving no glimmer through the thick stone walls , the fires are blazing joyously , and the voices and laughter of young unfrozen children are heard , and nothing belongs to winter but the grey hairs on the heads of the parents , within whose warm hearts child-like voices are heard , and child-like thoughts move to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 13]: The kernel of winter itself is spring , or a sleeping summer .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 45]: `` It was no wonder that the fool , cast out of the earth on a far more desolate spot than this , should seek to return within her bosom at this place of open doors , and should call it _ home _ .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 13]: For surely the surface of the earth had no home for him .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 19]: The mound at the foot of the gable contained the body of one who had shown him kindness .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 19]: He had followed the funeral that afternoon from the town , and had remained behind with the bell .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 79]: Indeed , it was his custom , though Elsie had not known it , to follow every funeral going to this , his favourite churchyard of Ruthven ; and , possibly in imitation of its booming , for it was still tolled at the funerals , he had given the old bell the name of the _ wow _ , and had translated its monotonous clangour into the articulate sounds -- _ come home , come home _ .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 41]: What precise meaning he attached to the words , it is impossible to say ; but it was evident that the place possessed a strange attraction for him , drawing him towards it by the cords of some spiritual magnetism .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 92]: It is possible that in the mind of the idiot there may have been some feeling about this churchyard and bell , which , in the mind of another , would have become a grand poetic thought ; a feeling as if the ghostly old bell hung at the church-door of the invisible world , and ever and anon rung out joyous notes -LRB- though they sounded sad in the ears of the living -RRB- , calling to the children of the unseen to _ come home , come home _ .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 51]: -- She sat for some time in silence ; for the bell did not ring again , and the fool spoke no more ; till the dews began to fall , when she rose and went home , followed by her companion , who passed the night in the barn .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 50]: `` From that hour Elsie was furnished with a visual image of the rest she sought ; an image which , mingling with deeper and holier thoughts , became , like the bow set in the cloud , the earthly pledge and sign of the fulfilment of heavenly hopes .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 100]: Often when the wintry fog of cold discomfort and homelessness filled her soul , all at once the picture of the little churchyard -- with the old gable and belfry , and the slanting sunlight steeping down to the very roots the long grass on the graves -- arose in the darkened chamber -LRB- _ camera obscura _ -RRB- of her soul ; and again she heard the faint Æolian sound of the bell , and the voice of the prophet-fool who interpreted the oracle ; and the inward weariness was soothed by the promise of a long sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 48]: Who can tell how many have been counted fools simply because they were prophets ; or how much of the madness in the world may be the utterance of thoughts true and just , but belonging to a region differing from ours in its nature and scenery !
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 55]: `` But to Elsie looking out of her window came the mocking tones of the idle boys who had chosen as the vehicle of their scorn the very words which showed the relation of the fool to the eternal , and revealed in him an element higher far than any yet developed in them .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 19]: They turned his glory into shame , like the enemies of David when they mocked the would-be king .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 23]: And the best in a man is often that which is most condemned by those who have not attained to his goodness .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 43]: The words , however , even as repeated by the boys , had not solely awakened indignation at the persecution of the old man : they had likewise comforted her with the thought of the refuge that awaited both him and her .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 11]: `` But the same evening a worse trial befell her .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 18]: Again she sat near the window , oppressed by the consciousness that her brother had come in .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 47]: He had gone up-stairs , and his dog had remained at the door , exchanging surly compliments with some of his own kind ; when the fool came strolling past , and , I do not know from what cause , the dog flew at him .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 8]: Elsie heard his cry and looked up .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 16]: Her fear of the brute vanished in a moment before her sympathy for her friend .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 32]: She darted from the house , and rushed towards the dog to drag him off the defenceless idiot , calling him by his name in a tone of anger and dislike .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 40]: He left the fool , and , springing at Elsie , seized her by the arm above the elbow with such a gripe that , in the midst of her agony , she fancied she heard the bone crack .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 16]: But she uttered no cry , for the most apprehensive are sometimes the most courageous .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 114]: Just then , however , her former lover was coming along the street , and , catching a glimpse of what had happened , was on the spot in an instant , took the dog by the throat with a gripe not inferior to his own , and having thus compelled him to give up his hold , dashed him on the ground with a force that almost stunned him , and then with a superadded kick sent him away limping and howling ; whereupon the fool , attacking him furiously with a stick , would certainly have finished him , had not his master descried his plight and come to his rescue .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 57]: `` Meantime the young surgeon had carried Elsie into the house ; for , as soon as she was rescued from the dog , she had fallen down in one of her fits , which were becoming more and more frequent of themselves , and little needed such a shock as this to increase their violence .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 37]: He was dressing her arm when she began to recover ; and when she opened her eyes , in a state of half-consciousness , the first object she beheld , was his face bending over her .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 48]: Re-calling nothing of what had occurred , it seemed to her , in the dreamy condition in which the fit had left her , the same face , unchanged , which had once shone in upon her tardy spring-time , and promised to ripen it into summer .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 14]: She forgot that it had departed and left her in the wintry cold .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 45]: And so she uttered wild words of love and trust ; and the youth , while stung with remorse at his own neglect , was astonished to perceive the poetic forms of beauty in which the soul of the uneducated maiden burst into flower .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 66]: But as her senses recovered themselves , the face gradually changed to her , as if the slow alteration of two years had been phantasmagorically compressed into a few moments ; and the glow departed from the maiden 's thoughts and words , and her soul found itself at the narrow window of the present , from which she could behold but a dreary country .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 20]: -- From the street came the iambic cry of the fool , ` Come hame , come hame . ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 41]: `` Tycho Brahe , I think , is said to have kept a fool , who frequently sat at his feet in his study , and to whose mutterings he used to listen in the pauses of his own thought .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 35]: The shining soul of the astronomer drew forth the rainbow of harmony from the misty spray of words ascending ever from the dark gulf into which the thoughts of the idiot were ever falling .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 52]: He beheld curious concurrences of words therein , and could read strange meanings from them -- sometimes even received wondrous hints for the direction of celestial inquiry , from what , to any other , and it may be to the fool himself , was but a ceaseless and aimless babble .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 6]: Such power lieth in words .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 35]: It is not then to be wondered at , that the sounds I have mentioned should fall on the ears of Elsie , at such a moment , as a message from God himself .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 28]: This then -- all this dreariness -- was but a passing show like the rest , and there lay somewhere for her a reality -- a home .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 9]: The tears burst up from her oppressed heart .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 11]: She received the message , and prepared to go home .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 15]: From that time her strength gradually sank , but her spirits as steadily rose .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 18]: `` The strength of the fool , too , began to fail , for he was old .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 19]: He bore all the signs of age , even to the grey hairs , which betokened no wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 27]: But one can not say what wisdom might be in him , or how far he had not fought his own battle , and been victorious .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 59]: Whether any notion of a continuance of life and thought dwelt in his brain , it is impossible to tell ; but he seemed to have the idea that this was not his home ; and those who saw him gradually approaching his end , might well anticipate for him a higher life in the world to come .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 22]: He had passed through this world without ever awakening to such a consciousness of being , as is common to mankind .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 30]: He had spent his years like a weary dream through a long night -- a strange , dismal , unkindly dream ; and now the morning was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 26]: Often in his dream had he listened with sleepy senses to the ringing of the bell , but that bell would awake him at last .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 36]: He was like a seed buried too deep in the soil , to which , therefore , has never forced its way upwards to the open air , never experienced the resurrection of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 41]: But seeds will grow ages after they have fallen into the earth ; and , indeed , with many kinds , and within some limits , the older the seed before it germinates , the more plentiful is the fruit .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 64]: And may it not be believed of many human beings , that , the great Husbandman having sown them like seeds in the soil of human affairs , there they lie buried a life long ; and only after the upturning of the soil by death , reach a position in which the awakening of their aspiration and the consequent growth become possible .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 8]: Surely he has made nothing in vain .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 35]: `` A violent cold and cough brought him at last near to his end , and , hearing that he was ill , Elsie ventured one bright spring day to go to see him .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 45]: When she entered the miserable room where he lay , he held out his hand to her with something like a smile , and muttered feebly and painfully , ` I 'm gaein ' to the wow , nae to come back again . '
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 34]: Elsie could not restrain her tears ; while the old man , looking fixedly at her , though with meaningless eyes , muttered , for the last time , ' _ Come hame !
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 3]: come hame !
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 36]: _ ' and sank into a lethargy , from which nothing could rouse him , till , next morning , he was waked by friendly death from the long sleep of this world 's night .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 38]: They bore him to his favourite church-yard , and buried him within the site of the old church , below his loved bell , which had ever been to him as the cuckoo-note of a coming spring .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 12]: Thus he at length obeyed its summons , and went home .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 14]: `` Elsie lingered till the first summer days lay warm on the land .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 19]: Several kind hearts in the village , hearing of her illness , visited her and ministered to her .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 16]: Wondering at her sweetness and patience , they regretted they had not known her before .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 25]: How much consolation might not their kindness have imparted , and how much might not their sympathy have strengthened her on her painful road !
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 11]: But they could not long have delayed her going home .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 18]: Nor , mentally constituted as she was , would this have been at all to be desired .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 16]: Indeed it was chiefly the expectation of departure that quieted and soothed her tremulous nature .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 38]: It is true that a deep spring of hope and faith kept singing on in her heart , but this alone , without the anticipation of speedy release , could only have kept her mind at peace .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 27]: It could not have reached , at least for a long time , the border land between body and mind , in which her disease lay .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 34]: `` One still night of summer , the nurse who watched by her bedside heard her murmur through her sleep , ' I hear it : _ come hame -- come hame _ .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 25]: I 'm comin ' , I 'm comin ' -- I 'm gaein ' hame to the wow , nae to come back . '
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 42]: She awoke at the sound of her own words , and begged the nurse to convey to her brother her last request , that she might be buried by the side of the fool , within the old church of Ruthven .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 19]: Then she turned her face to the wall , and in the morning was found quiet and cold .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 13]: She must have died within a few minutes after her last words .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 17]: She was buried according to her request ; and thus she , too , went home .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 52]: `` Side by side rest the aged fool and the young maiden ; for the bell called them , and they obeyed ; and surely they found the fire burning bright , and heard friendly voices , and felt sweet lips on theirs , in the home to which they went .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 10]: Surely both intellect and love were waiting them there .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 47]: `` Still the old bell hangs in the old gable ; and whenever another is borne to the old churchyard , it keeps calling to those who are left behind , with the same sad , but friendly and unchanging voice -- _ ` Come hame !
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 3]: come hame !
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 4]: come hame ! '
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 15]: _ '' For a full minute , there was silence in the little company .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 40]: I myself dared not look up , but the movement of indistinct and cloudy white over my undirected eyes , let me know that two or three , amongst them Adela , were lifting their handkerchiefs to their faces .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 8]: At length a voice broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 14]: `` How much of your affecting tale is true , Mr. Armstrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 7]: The voice belonged to Mrs. Cathcart .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 18]: `` I object to the question , '' said I. `` I do n't want to know .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 35]: Suppose , Mrs. Cathcart , I were to put this story-club , members , stories , and all , into a book , how would any one like to have her real existence questioned ?
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 18]: It would at least imply that I had made a very bad portrait of that one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 20]: The lady cast rather a frightened look at me , which I confess I was not sorry to see .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 5]: But the curate interposed .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 9]: `` What frightful sophistry , Mr. Smith ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 48]: Then turning to Mrs. Cathcart , he continued : `` I have not the slightest objection to answer your question , Mrs. Cathcart ; and if our friend Mr. Smith does not want to hear the answer , I will wait till he stops his ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 12]: He glanced to me , his black eyes twinkling with fun .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 18]: I saw that it was all he could do to keep from winking ; but he did .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 17]: `` Oh no , '' I answered ; `` I will share what is going . ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 16]: `` Well , then , the fool is a real character , in every point .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 17]: But I learned after I had written the sketch , that I had made one mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 15]: He was in reality about seventeen , when he was found on the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 8]: The bell is a real character too .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 8]: Elsie is a creature of my own .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 11]: So of course are the brother and the dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 22]: `` I do n't know whether to be glad or sorry that there was no Elsie , '' said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 10]: `` But did you know the fool yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 12]: `` Perfectly well , and had a great respect for him .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 17]: When a little boy , I was quite proud of the way he behaved to me .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 44]: He occasionally visited the general persecution of the boys , upon any boy he chanced to meet on the road ; but as often as I met him , he walked quietly past me , muttering ' _ Auntie 's folk _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 14]: or returning my greeting of _ ' A fine day , Colonel ! '
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 9]: _ with a grunted _ ` Ay ! '
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 15]: _ '' `` What did he mean by ` Auntie 's folk ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 4]: asked Mrs. Armstrong .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 17]: `` My grandmother was kind to him , and he always called her _ Auntie _ .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 64]: I can not tell how the fancy originated ; but certainly he knew all her descendants somehow -- a degree of intelligence not to have been expected of him -- and invariably murmured ` Auntie 's folk , ' as often as he passed any of them on the road , as if to remind himself that these were friends , or relations .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 16]: Possibly he had lived with an aunt before he was exposed on the moor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 11]: `` Is _ wow _ a word at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 47]: `` If you look into Jamieson 's Dictionary , '' said Armstrong , `` as I have done for the express purpose , you will find that the word is used differently in different quarters of the country -- chiefly , however , as a verb .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 29]: It means _ to bark , to howl ; _ likewise _ to wave or beckon ; _ also _ to woo , or make love to _ .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 13]: Any of these might be given as an explanation of his word .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 38]: But I do not think it had anything to do with these meanings ; nor was the word used , in that district , in either of the last two senses , in my time at least .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 29]: It was used , however , in the meaning of _ alas _ -- a form of _ woe _ in fact ; as _ wow 's me !
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 24]: _ But I believe it was , in the fool 's use , an attempt to reproduce the sound which the bell made .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 25]: If you repeat the word several times , resting on the final _ w _ , and pausing between each repetition -- _ wow !
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 2]: wow !
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 2]: wow !
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 37]: _ -- you will find that the sound is not at all unlike the tolling of a funeral bell ; and therefore the word is most probably an onomatopoetic invention of the fool 's own . ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 26]: Adela offered no remark upon the story , and I knew from her countenance that she was too much affected to be inclined to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 36]: Her eyes had that fixed , forward look , which , combined with haziness , indicates deep emotion , while the curves of her mouth were nearly straightened out by the compression of her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 42]: I had thought , while the reader went on , that she could hardly fail to find in the story of Elsie , some correspondence to her own condition and necessities : I now believe that she had found that correspondence .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 43]: More talk was not desirable ; and I was glad when , after a few attempts at ordinary conversation , Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield rose to take their leave , which was accepted by the whole company as a signal for departure .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 18]: `` But stay , '' I interposed ; `` who is to read or tell next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 15]: `` Why , I will be revenged on Harry , '' said the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 21]: `` That you ca n't , '' said the doctor ; `` for I have nothing to give you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 14]: `` You do n't mean to say you are going to jib ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 9]: I do n't say I wo n't read .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 28]: In fact I have a story in my head , and a bit of it on paper ; but I positively ca n't read next time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 12]: `` Will you oblige us with a story , Colonel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 27]: said I. `` My dear fellow , you know I never put pen to paper in my life , except when I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 20]: I may tell you a story before it is all over , but write one I can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 17]: `` A tale that is told is the best tale of all , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 10]: `` Shall we book you for next time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 7]: not next time ; positively not .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 17]: My story must come of itself , else I can not tell it at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 13]: `` Well , there 's nobody left but you , Mr. Bloomfield .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 10]: So you ca n't get rid of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 37]: `` I do n't think I ever wrote what was worth calling a story ; but I do n't mind reading you something of the sort which I have at home , on one condition . ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 10]: `` That nobody ask any questions about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 3]: certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 21]: `` But my only reason is , that somehow I feel it would all come to pieces if you did .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 50]: It is nothing , as a story ; but there are feelings expressed in it , which were very strong in me when I wrote it , and which I do not feel willing to talk about , although I have no objection to having them thought about . ''
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 7]: `` Well , that is settled .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 7]: When shall we meet again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 19]: `` To-morrow , or the day after , '' said the colonel ; `` which you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 18]: the day after , if I may have a word in it , '' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 20]: `` I shall be very busy to-morrow -- and we must n't crowd remedies either , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 11]: The close of the sentence was addressed to me only .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 23]: The rest of the company had taken leave , and were already at the door , when he made the last remark .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 28]: He now came up to his patient , felt her pulse , and put the question , `` How have you slept the last two nights ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 7]: `` Better , thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 11]: `` And do you feel refreshed when you wake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 9]: `` More so than for some time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 9]: `` I wo n't give you anything to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 5]: -- Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 4]: `` Good night .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 4]: Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 8]: This was all that passed between them .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 25]: Jealousy , with the six eyes of Colonel , Mrs. , and Percy Cathcart , was intent upon the pair during the brief conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 8]: And I thought Adela perceived the fact .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 3]: Chapter VII .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 5]: The schoolmaster 's story .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 55]: I was walking up the street the next day , when , finding I was passing the Grammar-school , and knowing there was nothing going on there now , I thought I should not be intruding if I dropped in upon the schoolmaster and his wife , and had a little chat with them .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 37]: I already counted them friends ; for I felt that however different our training and lives might have been , we all meant the same thing now , and that is the true bond of fellowship .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 14]: I found Mr. Bloomfield reading to his wife -- a novel , too .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 22]: Evidently he intended to make the most of this individual holiday , by making it as unlike a work-day as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 12]: `` I see you are enjoying yourselves , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 12]: `` It 's a shame to break in upon you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 8]: `` We are delighted to see you .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 23]: Your interruption will only postpone a good thing to a better , '' said the kind-hearted schoolmaster , laying down his book .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 8]: `` Will you take a pipe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 11]: `` With pleasure -- but not here , surely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 7]: we smoke everywhere in holiday-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 11]: `` You enjoy your holiday , I can see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 6]: `` I should think so .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 19]: I do n't believe one of the boys delights in a holiday quite as heartily as I do .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 14]: You must not imagine I do n't enjoy my work , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 6]: Earnest work breeds earnest play .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 11]: But you must find the labour wearisome at times . ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 9]: `` I confess I have felt it such .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 43]: I have said to myself sometimes : ` Am I to go on for ever teaching boys Latin grammar , till I wish there had never been a Latin nation to leave such an incubus upon the bosom of after ages ? '
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 57]: Then I would remind myself , that , under cover of grammar and geography , and all the other _ farce _ - meat -LRB- as the word ought to be written and pronounced -RRB- , I put something better into my pupils ; something that I loved myself , and cared to give to them .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 11]: But I often ask myself to what it all goes .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 8]: -- I learn to love my boys .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 10]: I kill in them all the bad I can .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 10]: I nourish in them all the good I can .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 24]: I send them across the borders of manhood -- and they leave me , and most likely I hear nothing more of them .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 14]: And I say to myself : ` My life is like a wind .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 7]: It blows and will cease . '
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 50]: But something says in reply : ` Wouldst thou not be one of God 's winds , content to blow , and scatter the rain and dew , and shake the plants into fresh life , and then pass away and know nothing of what thou hast done ? '
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 11]: And I answer : ` Yes , Lord . '' '
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 22]: `` You are not a wind ; you are a poet , Mr. Bloomfield , '' I said , with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 27]: `` One of the speechless ones , then , '' he returned , with a smile that showed plainly enough that the speechless longed for utterance .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 21]: It was such a smile as would , upon the face of a child , wile anything out of you .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 31]: Surely God , who needs no wiles to make him give what one is ready to receive , will let him sing some day , to his heart 's content !
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 11]: And me , too , O Lord , I pray .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 23]: `` What a pleasure it must be to you now , to have such a man as Mr. Armstrong for your curate !
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 19]: He will be a brother to you , '' I said , as soon as I could speak .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 17]: `` Mr , Smith , I can not tell you what he is to me already .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 17]: He is doing what I would fain have done -- what was denied to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 7]: `` I studied for the church .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 6]: But I aimed too high .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 12]: My heart burned within me , but my powers were small .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 16]: I wanted to relight the ancient lamp , but my rush-light would not kindle it .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 15]: My friends saw no light ; they only smelt burning : I was heterodox .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 12]: I hesitated , I feared , I yielded , I withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 15]: To this day , I do not know whether I did right or wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 11]: But I am honoured yet in being allowed to teach .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 23]: And if at the last I have the faintest ` Well done ' from the Master , I shall be satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 36]: Mrs. Bloomfield was gently weeping ; partly from regret , as I judged , that her husband was not in the position she would have given him , partly from delight in his manly goodness .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 33]: A watery film stood in the schoolmaster 's eyes , and his wise gentle face was irradiated with the light of a far-off morning , whose dawn was visible to his hope .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 18]: `` The world is the better for you at least , Mr. Bloomfield , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 48]: `` I wish some more of us were as sure as you of helping on the daily Creation , which is quite as certain a fact as that of old ; and is even more important to us , than that recorded in the book of Genesis .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 24]: It is not great battles alone that build up the world 's history , nor great poems alone that make the generations grow .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 34]: There is a still small rain from heaven that has more to do with the blessedness of nature and of human nature , than the mightiest earthquake , or the loveliest rainbow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 37]: `` I do comfort myself , '' he answered , `` at this Christmas-time , and for the whole year , with the thought that , after all , the world was saved by a child .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 18]: -- But that brings me to think of a little trouble I am in , Mr. Smith .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 23]: The only paper I have , at all fit for reading to-morrow night , is much too short to occupy the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 7]: What is to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 7]: we can talk about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 10]: `` That is just what I could not bear .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 31]: It is rather an odd composition , I fear ; but whether it be worth anything or not , I can not help having a great affection for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 10]: `` Then it is true , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 4]: `` There again !
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 14]: That is just one of the questions I do n't want to answer .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 22]: I quite sympathized with you last night in not wishing to know how much of Mr. Armstrong 's story was true .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 12]: Even if wholly fictitious , a good story is always true .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 40]: But there are things which one would have no right to invent , which would be worth nothing if they were invented , from the very circumstance of their origin in the brain , and not in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 43]: The very beauty of them demands that they should be fact ; or , if not , that they should not be told -- sent out poor unclothed spirits into the world before a body of fact has been prepared for them .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 16]: But I have always found it impossible to define the kinds of stories I mean .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 35]: The nearest I can come to it is this : If the force of the lesson depends on the story being a fact , it must not be told except it is a fact .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 25]: Then again , there are true things that one would be shy of telling , if he thought they would be attributed to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 14]: Now this story of mine is made up of fiction and fact both .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 37]: And I fear that if I were called upon to take it to pieces , it would lose the force of any little truth it possesses , besides exposing me to what I would gladly avoid .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 13]: Indeed I fear I ought not to read it at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 13]: `` You are amongst friends , you know , Mr. Bloomfield . ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 4]: `` Entirely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 9]: he asked , with a half comic expression .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 34]: `` Well , '' I answered , laughing , `` any exception that may exist , is hardly worth considering , and indeed ought to be thankfully accepted , as tending to wholesomeness .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 21]: Neither vinegar nor mustard would be desirable as food , you know ; yet -- '' `` I understand you .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 12]: I am ashamed of having made such a fuss about nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 11]: I will do my best , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 36]: I fear that the fastidiousness of the good man will not be excuse enough for the introduction of such a long preamble to a story for which only a few will in the least care .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 20]: But the said preamble happening to touch on some interesting subjects , I thought it well to record it .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 29]: As to the story itself , there are some remarks of Balzac in the introduction to one of his , that would well apply to the schoolmaster 's .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 43]: They are to the effect that some stories which have nothing in them as stories , yet fill one with an interest both gentle and profound , if they are read in the mood that is exactly fitted for their just reception .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 8]: Mr. Bloomfield conducted me to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 27]: `` I hope you will not think me a grumbler , '' he said ; `` I should not like your disapprobation , Mr. Smith . ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 13]: `` You do me great honour , '' I said , honestly .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 10]: `` Believe me there is no danger of that .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 9]: I understand and sympathize with you entirely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 21]: `` My love of approbation is large , '' he said , tapping the bump referred to with his forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 8]: `` Excuse it and me too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 23]: `` There is no need , my dear friend , '' I said , `` if I may call you such . ''
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 15]: His answer was a warm squeeze of the hand , with which we parted .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 35]: As I returned home , I met Henry Armstrong , mounted on a bay mare of a far different sort from what a sportsman would consider a doctor justified in using for his purposes .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 102]: In fact she was a thorough hunter ; no beauty certainly , with her ewe-neck , drooping tail , and white face and stocking ; but she had an eye at once gentle and wild as that of a savage angel , if my reader will condescend to dream for a moment of such an anomaly ; while her hind quarters were power itself , and her foreleg was flung right out from the shoulder with a gesture not of work but of delight ; the step itself being entirely one of work , -- long in proportion to its height .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 24]: The lines of her fore and hind-quarters converged so much , that there was hardly more than room for the saddle between them .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 7]: I had never seen such action .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 38]: Altogether , although not much of a hunting man , the motion of the creature gave me such a sense of power and joy , that I longed to be scouring the fields with her under me .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 43]: It was a sunshiny day , with a keen cold air , and a thin sprinkling of snow ; and Harry looked so radiant with health , that one could easily believe he had health to convey , if not to bestow .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 8]: He stopped and inquired after his patient .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 16]: `` Could you not get her to go out with you , Mr. Smith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 10]: `` Would that be safe , Mr. Henry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 14]: `` Perfectly safe , if she is willing to go ; not otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 20]: Get her to go willingly for ten minutes , and see if she is not the better for it .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 17]: What I want is to make the blood go quicker and more plentifully through her brain .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 6]: She has not fever enough .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 8]: She does not live fast enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 9]: `` I will try , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 8]: `` Have you been far to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 5]: `` Just come out .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 8]: You might tell that by the mare .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 10]: You should see her three hours after this . ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 23]: And he patted her neck as if he loved her -- as I am sure he did -- and trotted gently away .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 14]: When I came up to the gate , Beeves was standing at it .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 9]: `` A nice gentleman that , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 6]: `` He is , Beeves .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 7]: I quite agree with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 20]: `` And rides a good mare , sir ; and rides as well as any man in the country .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 10]: I never see him leave home in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 10]: Always goes gently out , and comes gently in .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 17]: What has gone between , you may see by her skin when she comes home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 8]: `` Does he hunt , Beeves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 18]: `` I believe not , sir ; except the fox crosses him in one of his rounds .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 21]: Then if he is heading anywhere in his direction , they say doctor and mare go at it like mad .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 24]: He 's got two more in his stable , better horses to look at ; but that 's the one to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 10]: `` I wonder how he affords such animals . ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 22]: `` They say he has a way of buying them lame , and a wonderful knack of setting them up again .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 7]: They all go , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 23]: `` Will you say to your mistress , that I should like very much if she would come to me here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 16]: Beeves stared , but said , `` Yes , sir , '' and went in .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 29]: I was now standing in front of the house , doubtful of the reception Adela would give my message , but judging that curiosity would aid my desire .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 4]: I was right .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 17]: Beeves came back with the message that his mistress would join me in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 13]: In a quarter of an hour she came , wrapt in furs .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 26]: She was very pale , but her eye was brighter than usual , and it did not shrink from the cold glitter of the snow .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 27]: She put her arm in mine , and we walked for ten minutes along the dry gravel walks , chatting cheerfully , about anything and nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 11]: `` Now you must go in , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 8]: `` Not yet , surely , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 17]: By the bye , do you think it was right of me to come out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 9]: `` Mr. Henry Armstrong said you might . ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 15]: She did not reply , but I thought a slight rose-colour tinged her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 15]: `` But he said you must not be out more than ten minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 14]: `` Well , I suppose I must do as I am told . ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 26]: And she turned at once , and went up the stair to the door , almost as lightly as any other girl of her age .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 8]: There was some progress , plainly enough .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 14]: But was that a rose-tinge I had seen on her cheek or not ?
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 60]: The next evening , after tea , we arranged ourselves much as on the last occasion ; and Mr. Bloomfield , taking a neat manuscript from his pocket , and evidently restraining himself from apology and explanation , although as evidently nervous about the whole proceeding , and jealous of his own presumption , began to read as follows .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 21]: His voice trembled as he read , and his wife 's face was a shade or two paler than usual .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 8]: `` BIRTH , DREAMING , AND DEATH .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 58]: `` In a little room , scantily furnished , lighted , not from the window , for it was dark without , and the shutters were closed , but from the peaked flame of a small , clear-burning lamp , sat a young man , with his back to the lamp and his face to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 41]: No book or paper on the table indicated labour just forsaken ; nor could one tell from his eyes , in which the light had all retreated inwards , whether his consciousness was absorbed in thought , or reverie only .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 53]: The window curtains , which scarcely concealed the shutters , were of coarse texture , but of brilliant scarlet -- for he loved bright colours ; and the faint reflection they threw on his pale , thin face , made it look more delicate than it would have seemed in pure daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 51]: Two or three bookshelves , suspended by cords from a nail in the wall , contained a collection of books , poverty-stricken as to numbers , with but few to fill up the chronological gap between the Greek New Testament and stray volumes of the poets of the present century .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 39]: But his love for the souls of his individual books was the stronger that there was no possibility of its degenerating into avarice for the bodies or outsides whose aggregate constitutes the piece of house-furniture called a library .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 73]: `` Some years before , the young man -LRB- my story is so short , and calls in so few personages , that I need not give him a name -RRB- had aspired , under the influence of religious and sympathetic feeling , to be a clergyman ; but Providence , either in the form of poverty , or of theological difficulty , had prevented his prosecuting his studies to that end .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 15]: And now he was only a village schoolmaster , nor likely to advance further .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 62]: I have said _ only _ a village schoolmaster ; but is it not better to be a teacher _ of _ babes than a preacher _ to _ men , at any time ; not to speak of those troublous times of transition , wherein a difference of degree must so often assume the appearance of a difference of kind ?
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 73]: That man is more happy -- I will not say more blessed -- who , loving boys and girls , is loved and revered by them , than he who , ministering unto men and women , is compelled to pour his words into the filter of religious suspicion , whence the water is allowed to pass away unheeded , and only the residuum is retained for the analysis of ignorant party-spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 38]: `` He had married a simple village girl , in whose eyes he was nobler than the noblest -- to whom he was the mirror , in which the real forms of all things around were reflected .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 8]: Who dares pity my poor village schoolmaster ?
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 6]: I fling his pity away .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 18]: Had he not found in her love the verdict of God , that he was worth loving ?
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 11]: Did he not in her possess the eternal and unchangeable ?
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 21]: Were not her eyes openings through which he looked into the great depths that could not be measured or represented ?
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 11]: She was his public , his society , his critic .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 10]: He found in her the heaven of his rest .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 11]: God gave unto him immortality , and he was glad .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 12]: For his ambition , it had died of its own mortality .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 51]: He read the words of Jesus , and the words of great prophets whom he has sent ; and learned that the wind-tossed anemone is a word of God as real and true as the unbending oak beneath which it grows -- that reality is an absolute existence precluding degrees .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 27]: If his mind was , as his room , scantily furnished , it was yet lofty ; if his light was small , it was brilliant .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 7]: God lived , and he lived .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 54]: Perhaps the highest moral height which a man can reach , and at the same time the most difficult of attainment , is the willingness to be _ nothing _ relatively , so that he attain that positive excellence which the original conditions of his being render not merely possible , but imperative .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 30]: It is nothing to a man to be greater or less than another -- to be esteemed or otherwise by the public or private world in which he moves .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 22]: Does he , or does he not , behold and love and live the unchangeable , the essential , the divine ?
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 12]: This he can only do according as God has made him .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 48]: He can behold and understand God in the least degree , as well as in the greatest , only by the godlike within him ; and he that loves thus the good and great has no room , no thought , no necessity for comparison and difference .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 5]: The truth satisfies him .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 6]: He lives in its absoluteness .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 17]: God makes the glow-worm as well as the star ; the light in both is divine .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 40]: If mine be an earth-star to gladden the wayside , I must cultivate humbly and rejoicingly its green earth-glow , and not seek to blanch it to the whiteness of the stars that lie in the fields of blue .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 17]: For to deny God in my own being is to cease to behold him in any .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 19]: God and man can meet only by the man 's becoming that which God meant him to be .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 18]: Then he enters into the house of life , which is greater than the house of fame .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 23]: It is better to be a child in a green field , than a knight of many orders in a state ceremonial .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 15]: `` All night long he had sat there , and morning was drawing nigh .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 45]: He has not heard the busy wind all night , heaping up snow against the house , which will make him start at the ghostly face of the world when at length he opens the shutters , and it stares upon him so white .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 74]: For up in a little room above , white-curtained , like the great earth without , there has been a storm , too , half the night -- moanings and prayers -- and some forbidden tears ; but now , at length , it is over ; and through the portals of two mouths instead of one , flows and ebbs the tide of the great air-sea which feeds the life of man .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 35]: With the sorrow of the mother , the new life is purchased for the child ; our very being is redeemed from nothingness with the pains of a death of which we know nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 22]: `` An hour has gone by since the watcher below has been delivered from the fear and doubt that held him .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 31]: He has seen the mother and the child -- the first she has given to life and him -- and has returned to his lonely room , quiet and glad .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 17]: `` But not long did he sit thus before thoughts of doubt awoke in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 15]: He remembered his scanty income , and the somewhat feeble health of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 25]: One or two small debts he had contracted , seemed absolutely to press on his bosom ; and the newborn child -- ` oh !
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 22]: how doubly welcome , ' he thought , ` if I were but half as rich again as I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 15]: -- brought with it , as its own love , so its own care .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 46]: The dogs of need , that so often hunt us up to heaven , seemed hard upon his heels ; and he prayed to God with fervour ; and as he prayed he fell asleep in his chair , and as he slept he dreamed .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 61]: The fire and the lamp burned on as before , but threw no rays into his soul ; yet now , for the first time , he seemed to become aware of the storm without ; for his dream was as follows : -- `` He lay in his bed , and listened to the howling of the wintry wind .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 28]: He trembled at the thought of the pitiless cold , and turned to sleep again , when he thought he heard a feeble knocking at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 12]: He rose in haste , and went down with a light .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 35]: As he opened the door , the wind , entering with a gust of frosty particles , blew out his candle ; but he found it unnecessary , for the grey dawn had come .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 35]: Looking out , he saw nothing at first ; but a second look , turned downwards , showed him a little half-frozen child , who looked quietly , but beseechingly , in his face .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 19]: His hair was filled with drifted snow , and his little hands and cheeks were blue with cold .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 21]: The heart of the schoolmaster swelled to bursting with the spring-flood of love and pity that rose up within it .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 37]: He lifted the child to his bosom , and carried him into the house ; where , in the dream 's incongruity , he found a fire blazing in the room in which he now slept .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 7]: The child said never a word .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 23]: He set him by the fire , and made haste to get hot water , and put him in a warm bath .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 71]: He never doubted that this was a stray orphan who had wandered to him for protection , and he felt that he could not part with him again ; even though the train of his previous troubles and doubts once more passed through the mind of the dreamer , and there seemed no answer to his perplexities for the lack of that cheap thing , gold -- yea , silver .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 59]: But when he had undressed and bathed the little orphan , and having dried him on his knees , set him down to reach something warm to wrap him in , the boy suddenly looked up in his face , as if revived , and said with a heavenly smile , ' I am the child Jesus . '
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 6]: ` The child Jesus ! '
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 6]: said the dreamer , astonished .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 9]: ` Thou art like any other child . '
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 27]: ` No , do not say so , ' returned the boy ; ` but say , _ Any other child is like me _ . '
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 53]: And the child and the dream slowly faded away ; and he awoke with these words sounding in his heart -- ` Whosoever shall receiveth one of such children in my name , receiveth me ; and whosoever shall receive me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me . '
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 58]: It was the voice of God saying to him : ` Thou wouldst receive the child whom I sent thee out of the cold , stormy night ; receive the new child out of the cold waste into the warm human house , as the door by which it can enter God 's house , its home .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 19]: If better could be done for it , or for thee , would I have sent it hither ?
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 15]: Through thy love , my little one must learn my love and be blessed .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 10]: And thou shall not keep it without thy reward .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 15]: For thy necessities -- in thy little house , is there not yet room ?
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 10]: in thy barrel , is there not yet meal ?
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 8]: and thy purse is not empty quite .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 11]: Thou canst not eat more than a mouthful at once .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 6]: I have made thee so .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 12]: Is it any trouble to me to take care of thee ?
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 17]: Only I prefer to feed thee from my own hand , and not from thy store .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 31]: ` And the schoolmaster sprang up in joy , ran upstairs , kissed his wife , and clasped the baby in his arms in the name of the child Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 15]: And in that embrace , he knew that he received God to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 38]: Soon , with a tender , beaming face , he was wading through the snow to the school-house , where he spent a happy day amidst the rosy faces and bright eyes of his boys and girls .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 74]: These , likewise , he loved the more dearly and joyfully for that dream , and those words in his heart ; so that , amidst their true child-faces , -LRB- all going well with them , as not unfrequently happened in his schoolroom -RRB- , he felt as if all the elements of Paradise were gathered around him , and knew that he was God 's child , doing God 's work .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 33]: `` But while that dream was passing through the soul of the husband , another visited the wife , as she lay in the faintness and trembling joy of the new motherhood .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 57]: For although she that has been mother before , is not the less a new mother to the new child , her former relation not covering with its wings the fresh bird in the nest of her bosom , yet there must be a peculiar delight in the thoughts and feelings that come with the first-born .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 69]: -- As she lay half in a sleep , half in a faint , with the vapours of a gentle delirium floating through her brain , without losing the sense of existence she lost the consciousness of its form , and thought she lay , not a young mother in her bed , but a nosegay of wild flowers in a basket , crushed , flattened and half-withered .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 33]: With her in the basket lay other bunches of flowers , whose odours , some rare as well as rich , revealed to her the sad contrast in which she was placed .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 44]: Beside her lay a cluster of delicately curved , faintly tinged , tea-scented roses ; while she was only blue hyacinth bells , pale primroses , amethyst anemones , closed blood-coloured daisies , purple violets , and one sweet-scented , pure white orchis .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 19]: The basket lay on the counter of a well-known little shop in the village , waiting for purchasers .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 19]: By and by her own husband entered the shop , and approached the basket to choose a nosegay .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 9]: thought she , ` will he choose me ?
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 20]: How dreadful if he should not , and I should be left lying here , while he takes another !
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 7]: But how should he choose me ?
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 14]: They are all so beautiful ; and even my scent is nearly gone .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 12]: And he can not know that it is I lying here .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 3]: alas ! '
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 37]: But as she thought thus , she felt his hand clasp her , heard the ransom-money fall , and felt that she was pressed to his face and lips , as he passed from the shop .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 14]: He _ had _ chosen her ; he _ had _ known her .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 13]: She opened her eyes : her husband 's kiss had awakened her .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 63]: She did not speak , but looked up thankfully in his eyes , as if he had , in fact , like one of the old knights , delivered her from the transformation of some evil magic , by the counter-enchantment of a kiss , and restored her from a half-withered nosegay to be a woman , a wife , a mother .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 30]: The dream comforted her much , for she had often feared that she , the simple , so-called uneducated girl , could not be enough for the great schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 62]: But soon her thoughts flowed into another channel ; the tears rose in her dark eyes , shining clear from beneath a stream that was not of sorrow ; and it was only weakness that kept her from uttering audible words like these : -- ` Father in heaven , shall I trust my husband 's love , and doubt thine ?
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 27]: Wilt thou meet less richly the fearing hope of thy child 's heart , than he in my dream met the longing of his wife 's ?
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 20]: He was perfected in my eyes by the love he bore me -- shall I find thee less complete ?
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 43]: Here I lie on thy world , faint , and crushed , and withered ; and my soul often seems as if it had lost all the odours that should float up in the sweet-smelling savour of thankfulness and love to thee .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 42]: But thou hast only to take me , only to choose me , only to clasp me to thy bosom , and I shall be a beautiful singing angel , singing to God , and comforting my husband while I sing .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 12]: Father , take me , possess me , fill me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 17]: `` So she lay patiently waiting for the summer-time of restored strength that drew slowly nigh .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 28]: With her husband and her child near her , in her soul , and God everywhere , there was for her no death , and no hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 13]: When she said to herself , ` How rich I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 34]: it was with the riches that pass not away -- the riches of the Son of man ; for in her treasures , the human and the divine were blended -- were one .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 12]: `` But there was a hard trial in store for them .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 32]: They had learned to receive what the Father sent : they had now to learn that what he gave he gave eternally , after his own being -- his own glory .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 64]: For ere the mother awoke from her first sleep , the baby , like a frolicsome child - angel , that but tapped at his mother 's window and fled -- the baby died ; died while the mother slept away the pangs of its birth , died while the father was teaching other babes out of the joy of his new fatherhood .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 40]: `` When the mother woke , she lay still in her joy -- the joy of a doubled life ; and knew not that death had been there , and had left behind only the little human coffin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 15]: ` Nurse , bring me the baby , ' she said at last . '
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 7]: I want to see it . '
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 11]: `` But the nurse pretended not to hear . '' '
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 6]: I want to nurse it .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 4]: Bring it . '
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 19]: `` She had not yet learned to say _ him _ ; for it was her first baby .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 16]: `` But the nurse went out of the room , and remained some minutes away .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 22]: When she returned , the mother spoke more absolutely , and the nurse was compelled to reply -- at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 20]: ` Nurse , do bring me the baby ; I am quite able to nurse it now . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 10]: ` Not yet , if you please , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 8]: Really you must rest a while first .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 8]: Do try to go to sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 92]: `` The nurse spoke steadily , and looked her too straight in the face ; and there was a constraint in her voice , a determination to be calm , that at once roused the suspicion of the mother ; for though her first-born was dead , and she had given birth to what was now , as far as the eye could reach , the waxen image of a son , a child had come from God , and had departed to him again ; and she was his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 47]: `` And the fear fell upon her heart that it might be as it was ; and , looking at her attendant with a face blanched yet more with fear than with suffering , she said , '' ` Nurse , is the baby -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 35]: `` She could not say _ dead _ ; for to utter the word would be at once to make it possible that the only fruit of her labour had been pain and sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 59]: `` But the nurse saw that further concealment was impossible ; and , without another word , went and fetched the husband , who , with face pale as the mother 's , brought the baby , dressed in its white clothes , and laid it by its mother 's side , where it lay too still . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 45]: ` Oh , ma'am , do not take on so , ' said the nurse , as she saw the face of the mother grow like the face of the child , as if she were about to rush after him into the dark .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 12]: `` But she was not ` taking on ' at all .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 19]: She only felt that pain at her heart , which is the farewell kiss of a long-cherished joy .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 65]: Though cast out of paradise into a world that looked very dull and weary , yet , used to suffering , and always claiming from God the consolation it needed , and satisfied with that , she was able , presently , to look up in her husband 's face , and try to reassure him of her well-being by a dreary smile . ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 17]: ` Leave the baby , ' she said ; and they left it where it was .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 33]: Long and earnestly she gazed on the perfect tiny features of the little alabaster countenance , and tried to feel that this was the child she had been so long waiting for .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 25]: As she looked , she fancied she heard it breathe , and she thought -- ` What if it should be only asleep ! '
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 4]: but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 23]: the eyes would not open , and when she drew it close to her , she shivered to feel it so cold .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 43]: At length , as her eyes wandered over and over the little face , a look of her husband dawned unexpectedly upon it ; and , as if the wife 's heart awoke the mother 's she cried out , ` Baby !
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 3]: baby ! '
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 12]: and burst into tears , during which weeping she fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 16]: `` When she awoke , she found the babe had been removed while she slept .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 34]: But the unsatisfied heart of the mother longed to look again on the form of the child ; and again , though with remonstrance from the nurse , it was laid beside her .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 33]: All day and all night long , it remained by her side , like a little frozen thing that had wandered from its home , and now lay dead by the door .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 36]: `` Next morning the nurse protested that she must part with it , for it made her fret ; but she knew it quieted her , and she would rather keep her little lifeless babe .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 47]: At length the nurse appealed to the father ; and the mother feared he would think it necessary to remove it ; but to her joy and gratitude he said , ` No , no ; let her keep it as long as she likes . '
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 15]: And she loved her husband the more for that ; for he understood her .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 55]: `` Then she had the cradle brought near the bed , all ready as it was for a live child that had open eyes , and therefore needed sleep -- needed the lids of the brain to close , when it was filled full of the strange colours and forms of the new world .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 12]: But this one needed no cradle , for it slept on .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 30]: It needed , instead of the little curtains to darken it to sleep , a great sunlight to wake it up from the darkness , and the ever-satisfied rest .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 34]: Yet she laid it in the cradle , which she had set near her , where she could see it , with the little hand and arm laid out on the white coverlet .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 8]: If she could only keep it so !
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 27]: Could not something be done , if not to awake it , yet to turn it to stone , and let it remain so for ever ?
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 39]: No ; the body must go back to its mother , the earth , and the _ form _ which is immortal , being the thought of God , must go back to its Father -- the Maker .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 18]: And as it lay in the white cradle , a white coffin was being made for it .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 20]: And the mother thought : ' I wonder which trees are growing coffins for my husband and me . '
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 78]: `` But ere the child , that had the prayer of Job in his grief , and had died from its mother 's womb , was carried away to be buried , the mother prayed over it this prayer : -- ' O God , if thou wilt not let me be a mother , I have one refuge : I will go back and be a child : I will be thy child more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 11]: My mother-heart will find relief in childhood towards its Father .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 17]: For is it not the same nature that makes the true mother and the true child ?
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 12]: Is it not the same thought blossoming upward and blossoming downward ?
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 11]: So there is God the Father and God the Son .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 9]: Thou wilt keep my little son for me .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 10]: He has gone home to be nursed for me .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 21]: And when I grow well , I will be more simple , and truthful , and joyful in thy sight .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 15]: And now thou art taking away my child , my plaything , from me .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 33]: But I think how pleased I should be , if I had a daughter , and she loved me so well that she only smiled when I took her plaything from her .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 12]: I will not disappoint thee -- thou shall have thy joy .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 17]: Here I am , do with me what thou wilt ; I will only smile . '
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 10]: `` And how fared the heart of the father ?
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 45]: At first , in the bitterness of his grief , he called the loss of his child a punishment for his doubt and unbelief ; and the feeling of punishment made the stroke more keen , and the heart less willing to endure it .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 9]: But better thoughts woke within him ere long .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 32]: `` The old woman who swept out his schoolroom , came in the evening to inquire after the mistress , and to offer her condolences on the loss of the baby .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 43]: She came likewise to tell the news , that a certain old man of little respectability had departed at last , unregretted by a single soul in the village but herself , who had been his nurse through the last tedious illness .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 33]: `` The schoolmaster thought with himself : '' ` Can that soiled and withered leaf of a man , and my little snow-flake of a baby , have gone the same road ?
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 7]: Will they meet by the way ?
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 10]: Can they talk about the same thing -- anything ?
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 22]: They must part on the boarders of the shining land , and they could hardly speak by the way . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 16]: ` He will live four-and-twenty hours , nurse , ' the doctor had said . ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 37]: ` No , doctor ; he will die to-night , ' the nurse had replied ; during which whispered dialogue , the patient had lain breathing quietly , for the last of suffering was nearly over .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 21]: He was at the close of an ill-spent life , not so much selfishly towards others as indulgently towards himself .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 64]: He had failed of true joy by trying often and perseveringly to create a false one ; and now , about to knock at the gate of the other world , he bore with him no burden of the good things of this ; and one might be tempted to say of him , that it were better he had not been born .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 16]: The great majestic mystery lay before him -- but when would he see its majesty ?
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 41]: `` He was dying thus , because he had tried to live as Nature said he should not live ; and he had taken his own wages -- for the law of the Maker is the necessity of his creature .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 32]: His own children had forsaken him , for they were not perfect as their Father in heaven , who maketh his sun to shine on the evil and on the good .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 71]: Instead of doubling their care as his need doubled , they had thought of the disgrace he brought on them , and not of the duty they owed him ; and now , left to die alone for them , he was waited on by this hired nurse , who , familiar with death-beds , knew better than the doctor -- knew that he could live only a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 34]: `` Stooping to his ear , she had told him , as gently as she could -- for she thought she ought not to conceal it -- that he must die that night .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 45]: He had lain silent for a few moments ; then had called her , and , with broken and failing voice , had said , ` Nurse , you are the only friend I have : give me one kiss before I die . '
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 9]: And the woman-heart had answered the prayer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 30]: ` And , ' said the old woman , ` he put his arms round my neck , and gave me a long kiss , such a long kiss !
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 14]: and then he turned his face away , and never spoke again . '
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 25]: `` So , with the last unction of a woman 's kiss , with this baptism for the dead , he had departed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 5]: ` Poor old man !
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 14]: he had not quite destroyed his heart yet , ' thought the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 44]: ` Surely it was the child-nature that woke in him at the last , when the only thing left for his soul to desire , the only thing he could think of as a preparation for the dread something , was a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 8]: Strange conjunction , yet simple and natural !
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 5]: Eternity -- a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 11]: Kiss me ; for I am going to the Unknown !
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 6]: -- Poor old man ! '
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 71]: the schoolmaster went on in his thoughts , ' I hope my baby has met him , and put his tiny hand in the poor old shaking hand , and so led him across the borders into the shining land , and up to where Jesus sits , and said to the Lord : `` Lord , forgive this old man , for he knew not what he did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 10]: And I trust the Lord has forgiven him . '
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 25]: `` And then the bereaved father fell on his knees , and cried out : '' ` Lord , thou hast not punished me .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 17]: Thou wouldst not punish for a passing thought of troubled unbelief , with which I strove .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 19]: Lord , take my child and his mother and me , and do what thou wilt with us .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 11]: I know thou givest not , to take again . '
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 28]: `` And ere the schoolmaster could call his protestantism to his aid , he had ended his prayer with the cry : '' ` And O God !
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 18]: have mercy upon the poor old man , and lay not his sins to his charge . '
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 22]: `` For , though a woman 's kiss may comfort a man to eternity , it is not all he needs .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 17]: And the thought of his lost child had made the soul of the father compassionate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 13]: * * * * * He ceased , and we sat silent .
