Parsing [sent. 1 len. 6]: ROUGHING IT BY MARK TWAIN .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 6]: -LRB- SAMUEL L. CLEMENS . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 2]: PREFATORY .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 18]: This book is merely a personal narrative , and not a pretentious history or a philosophical dissertation .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 38]: It is a record of several years of variegated vagabondizing , and its object is rather to help the resting reader while away an idle hour than afflict him with metaphysics , or goad him with science .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 51]: Still , there is information in the volume ; information concerning an interesting episode in the history of the Far West , about which no books have been written by persons who were on the ground in person , and saw the happenings of the time with their own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 55]: I allude to the rise , growth and culmination of the silver-mining fever in Nevada - a curious episode , in some respects ; the only one , of its peculiar kind , that has occurred in the land ; and the only one , indeed , that is likely to occur in it .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 19]: Yes , take it all around , there is quite a good deal of information in the book .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 34]: I regret this very much ; but really it could not be helped : information appears to stew out of me naturally , like the precious ottar of roses out of the otter .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 24]: Sometimes it has seemed to me that I would give worlds if I could retain my facts ; but it can not be .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 20]: The more I calk up the sources , and the tighter I get , the more I leak wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 17]: Therefore , I can only claim indulgence at the hands of the reader , not justification .

Parsing [sent. 99 len. 2]: APPENDIX .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 68]: A. -- Brief Sketch of Mormon History B. -- The Mountain Meadows Massacre C. -- Concerning a Frightful Assassination that was never Consummated CHAPTER I. My brother had just been appointed Secretary of Nevada Territory -- an office of such majesty that it concentrated in itself the duties and dignities of Treasurer , Comptroller , Secretary of State , and Acting Governor in the Governor 's absence .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 30]: A salary of eighteen hundred dollars a year and the title of `` Mr. Secretary , '' gave to the great position an air of wild and imposing grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 12]: I was young and ignorant , and I envied my brother .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 35]: I coveted his distinction and his financial splendor , but particularly and especially the long , strange journey he was going to make , and the curious new world he was going to explore .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 6]: He was going to travel !
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 21]: I never had been away from home , and that word `` travel '' had a seductive charm for me .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 79]: Pretty soon he would be hundreds and hundreds of miles away on the great plains and deserts , and among the mountains of the Far West , and would see buffaloes and Indians , and prairie dogs , and antelopes , and have all kinds of adventures , and may be get hanged or scalped , and have ever such a fine time , and write home and tell us all about it , and be a hero .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 46]: And he would see the gold mines and the silver mines , and maybe go about of an afternoon when his work was done , and pick up two or three pailfuls of shining slugs , and nuggets of gold and silver on the hillside .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 52]: And by and by he would become very rich , and return home by sea , and be able to talk as calmly about San Francisco and the ocean , and `` the isthmus '' as if it was nothing of any consequence to have seen those marvels face to face .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 13]: What I suffered in contemplating his happiness , pen can not describe .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 44]: And so , when he offered me , in cold blood , the sublime position of private secretary under him , it appeared to me that the heavens and the earth passed away , and the firmament was rolled together as a scroll !
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 7]: I had nothing more to desire .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 5]: My contentment was complete .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 15]: At the end of an hour or two I was ready for the journey .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 34]: Not much packing up was necessary , because we were going in the overland stage from the Missouri frontier to Nevada , and passengers were only allowed a small quantity of baggage apiece .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 23]: There was no Pacific railroad in those fine times of ten or twelve years ago -- not a single rail of it .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 20]: I only proposed to stay in Nevada three months -- I had no thought of staying longer than that .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 20]: I meant to see all I could that was new and strange , and then hurry home to business .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 23]: I little thought that I would not see the end of that three-month pleasure excursion for six or seven uncommonly long years !
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 39]: I dreamed all night about Indians , deserts , and silver bars , and in due time , next day , we took shipping at the St. Louis wharf on board a steamboat bound up the Missouri River .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 14]: We were six days going from St. Louis to `` St. Jo . ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 37]: -- a trip that was so dull , and sleepy , and eventless that it has left no more impression on my memory than if its duration had been six minutes instead of that many days .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 76]: No record is left in my mind , now , concerning it , but a confused jumble of savage-looking snags , which we deliberately walked over with one wheel or the other ; and of reefs which we butted and butted , and then retired from and climbed over in some softer place ; and of sand-bars which we roosted on occasionally , and rested , and then got out our crutches and sparred over .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 15]: In fact , the boat might almost as well have gone to St. Jo .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 28]: by land , for she was walking most of the time , anyhow -- climbing over reefs and clambering over snags patiently and laboriously all day long .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 25]: The captain said she was a `` bully '' boat , and all she wanted was more `` shear '' and a bigger wheel .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 20]: I thought she wanted a pair of stilts , but I had the deep sagacity not to say so .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 41]: The first thing we did on that glad evening that landed us at St. Joseph was to hunt up the stage-office , and pay a hundred and fifty dollars apiece for tickets per overland coach to Carson City , Nevada .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 20]: The next morning , bright and early , we took a hasty breakfast , and hurried to the starting-place .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 39]: Then an inconvenience presented itself which we had not properly appreciated before , namely , that one can not make a heavy traveling trunk stand for twenty-five pounds of baggage -- because it weighs a good deal more .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 12]: But that was all we could take -- twenty-five pounds each .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 21]: So we had to snatch our trunks open , and make a selection in a good deal of a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 22]: We put our lawful twenty-five pounds apiece all in one valise , and shipped the trunks back to St. Louis again .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 46]: It was a sad parting , for now we had no swallow-tail coats and white kid gloves to wear at Pawnee receptions in the Rocky Mountains , and no stove-pipe hats nor patent-leather boots , nor anything else necessary to make life calm and peaceful .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 7]: We were reduced to a war-footing .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 40]: Each of us put on a rough , heavy suit of clothing , woolen army shirt and `` stogy '' boots included ; and into the valise we crowded a few white shirts , some under-clothing and such things .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 51]: My brother , the Secretary , took along about four pounds of United States statutes and six pounds of Unabridged Dictionary ; for we did not know -- poor innocents -- that such things could be bought in San Francisco on one day and received in Carson City the next .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 39]: I was armed to the teeth with a pitiful little Smith & Wesson 's seven-shooter , which carried a ball like a homoeopathic pill , and it took the whole seven to make a dose for an adult .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 7]: But I thought it was grand .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 10]: It appeared to me to be a dangerous weapon .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 14]: It only had one fault -- you could not hit anything with it .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 52]: One of our `` conductors '' practiced awhile on a cow with it , and as long as she stood still and behaved herself she was safe ; but as soon as she went to moving about , and he got to shooting at other things , she came to grief .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 27]: The Secretary had a small-sized Colt 's revolver strapped around him for protection against the Indians , and to guard against accidents he carried it uncapped .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 7]: Mr. George Bemis was dismally formidable .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 6]: George Bemis was our fellow-traveler .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 7]: We had never seen him before .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 23]: He wore in his belt an old original `` Allen '' revolver , such as irreverent people called a `` pepper-box . ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 12]: Simply drawing the trigger back , cocked and fired the pistol .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 34]: As the trigger came back , the hammer would begin to rise and the barrel to turn over , and presently down would drop the hammer , and away would speed the ball .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 29]: To aim along the turning barrel and hit the thing aimed at was a feat which was probably never done with an `` Allen '' in the world .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 38]: But George 's was a reliable weapon , nevertheless , because , as one of the stage-drivers afterward said , `` If she did n't get what she went after , she would fetch something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 5]: And so she did .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 28]: She went after a deuce of spades nailed against a tree , once , and fetched a mule standing about thirty yards to the left of it .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 25]: Bemis did not want the mule ; but the owner came out with a double-barreled shotgun and persuaded him to buy it , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 11]: It was a cheerful weapon -- the `` Allen . ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 29]: Sometimes all its six barrels would go off at once , and then there was no safe place in all the region round about , but behind it .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 15]: We took two or three blankets for protection against frosty weather in the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 23]: In the matter of luxuries we were modest -- we took none along but some pipes and five pounds of smoking tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 39]: We had two large canteens to carry water in , between stations on the Plains , and we also took with us a little shot-bag of silver coin for daily expenses in the way of breakfasts and dinners .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 18]: By eight o'clock everything was ready , and we were on the other side of the river .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 25]: We jumped into the stage , the driver cracked his whip , and we bowled away and left `` the States '' behind us .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 16]: It was a superb summer morning , and all the landscape was brilliant with sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 52]: There was a freshness and breeziness , too , and an exhilarating sense of emancipation from all sorts of cares and responsibilities , that almost made us feel that the years we had spent in the close , hot city , toiling and slaving , had been wasted and thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 26]: We were spinning along through Kansas , and in the course of an hour and a half we were fairly abroad on the great Plains .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 38]: Just here the land was rolling -- a grand sweep of regular elevations and depressions as far as the eye could reach -- like the stately heave and swell of the ocean 's bosom after a storm .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 19]: And everywhere were cornfields , accenting with squares of deeper green , this limitless expanse of grassy land .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 28]: But presently this sea upon dry ground was to lose its `` rolling '' character and stretch away for seven hundred miles as level as a floor !
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 22]: Our coach was a great swinging and swaying stage , of the most sumptuous description -- an imposing cradle on wheels .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 50]: It was drawn by six handsome horses , and by the side of the driver sat the `` conductor , '' the legitimate captain of the craft ; for it was his business to take charge and care of the mails , baggage , express matter , and passengers .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 10]: We three were the only passengers , this trip .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 9]: We sat on the back seat , inside .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 24]: About all the rest of the coach was full of mail bags -- for we had three days ' delayed mails with us .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 17]: Almost touching our knees , a perpendicular wall of mail matter rose up to the roof .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 24]: There was a great pile of it strapped on top of the stage , and both the fore and hind boots were full .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 50]: We had twenty-seven hundred pounds of it aboard , the driver said -- `` a little for Brigham , and Carson , and ` Frisco , but the heft of it for the Injuns , which is powerful troublesome ` thout they get plenty of truck to read . ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 65]: But as he just then got up a fearful convulsion of his countenance which was suggestive of a wink being swallowed by an earthquake , we guessed that his remark was intended to be facetious , and to mean that we would unload the most of our mail matter somewhere on the Plains and leave it to the Indians , or whosoever wanted it .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 21]: We changed horses every ten miles , all day long , and fairly flew over the hard , level road .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 24]: We jumped out and stretched our legs every time the coach stopped , and so the night found us still vivacious and unfatigued .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 31]: After supper a woman got in , who lived about fifty miles further on , and we three had to take turns at sitting outside with the driver and conductor .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 8]: Apparently she was not a talkative woman .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 82]: She would sit there in the gathering twilight and fasten her steadfast eyes on a mosquito rooting into her arm , and slowly she would raise her other hand till she had got his range , and then she would launch a slap at him that would have jolted a cow ; and after that she would sit and contemplate the corpse with tranquil satisfaction -- for she never missed her mosquito ; she was a dead shot at short range .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 13]: She never removed a carcase , but left them there for bait .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 31]: I sat by this grim Sphynx and watched her kill thirty or forty mosquitoes -- watched her , and waited for her to say something , but she never did .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 8]: So I finally opened the conversation myself .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 16]: I said : `` The mosquitoes are pretty bad , about here , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 5]: `` You bet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 12]: `` What did I understand you to say , madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 5]: `` You BET ! ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 27]: Then she cheered up , and faced around and said : `` Danged if I did n't begin to think you fellers was deef and dumb .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 7]: I did , b ` gosh .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 23]: Here I 've sot , and sot , and sot , a-bust 'n muskeeters and wonderin ' what was ailin ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 47]: Fust I thot you was deef and dumb , then I thot you was sick or crazy , or suthin ' , and then by and by I begin to reckon you was a passel of sickly fools that could n't think of nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 7]: Wher 'd ye come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 8]: The Sphynx was a Sphynx no more !
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 58]: The fountains of her great deep were broken up , and she rained the nine parts of speech forty days and forty nights , metaphorically speaking , and buried us under a desolating deluge of trivial gossip that left not a crag or pinnacle of rejoinder projecting above the tossing waste of dislocated grammar and decomposed pronunciation !
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 8]: How we suffered , suffered , suffered !
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 24]: She went on , hour after hour , till I was sorry I ever opened the mosquito question and gave her a start .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 94]: She never did stop again until she got to her journey 's end toward daylight ; and then she stirred us up as she was leaving the stage -LRB- for we were nodding , by that time -RRB- , and said : `` Now you git out at Cottonwood , you fellers , and lay over a couple o ' days , and I 'll be along some time to-night , and if I can do ye any good by edgin ' in a word now and then , I 'm right thar .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 74]: Folks 'll tell you ' t I 've always ben kind o ' offish and partic ` lar for a gal that 's raised in the woods , and I am , with the rag-tag and bob-tail , and a gal has to be , if she wants to be anything , but when people comes along which is my equals , I reckon I 'm a pretty sociable heifer after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 11]: We resolved not to `` lay by at Cottonwood . ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 51]: About an hour and a half before daylight we were bowling along smoothly over the road -- so smoothly that our cradle only rocked in a gentle , lulling way , that was gradually soothing us to sleep , and dulling our consciousness -- when something gave away under us !
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 12]: We were dimly aware of it , but indifferent to it .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 4]: The coach stopped .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 67]: We heard the driver and conductor talking together outside , and rummaging for a lantern , and swearing because they could not find it -- but we had no interest in whatever had happened , and it only added to our comfort to think of those people out there at work in the murky night , and we snug in our nest with the curtains drawn .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 34]: But presently , by the sounds , there seemed to be an examination going on , and then the driver 's voice said : `` By George , the thoroughbrace is broke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 18]: This startled me broad awake -- as an undefined sense of calamity is always apt to do .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 34]: I said to myself : `` Now , a thoroughbrace is probably part of a horse ; and doubtless a vital part , too , from the dismay in the driver 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 20]: Leg , maybe -- and yet how could he break his leg waltzing along such a road as this ?
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 9]: No , it ca n't be his leg .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 12]: That is impossible , unless he was reaching for the driver .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 14]: Now , what can be the thoroughbrace of a horse , I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 18]: Well , whatever comes , I shall not air my ignorance in this crowd , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 26]: Just then the conductor 's face appeared at a lifted curtain , and his lantern glared in on us and our wall of mail matter .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 15]: He said : `` Gents , you 'll have to turn out a spell .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 5]: Thoroughbrace is broke . ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 16]: We climbed out into a chill drizzle , and felt ever so homeless and dreary .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 51]: When I found that the thing they called a `` thoroughbrace '' was the massive combination of belts and springs which the coach rocks itself in , I said to the driver : `` I never saw a thoroughbrace used up like that , before , that I can remember .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 6]: How did it happen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 27]: `` Why , it happened by trying to make one coach carry three days ' mail -- that 's how it happened , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 30]: `` And right here is the very direction which is wrote on all the newspaper-bags which was to be put out for the Injuns for to keep 'em quiet .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 29]: It 's most uncommon lucky , becuz it 's so nation dark I should ` a ' gone by unbeknowns if that air thoroughbrace had n't broke . ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 50]: I knew that he was in labor with another of those winks of his , though I could not see his face , because he was bent down at work ; and wishing him a safe delivery , I turned to and helped the rest get out the mail-sacks .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 14]: It made a great pyramid by the roadside when it was all out .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 31]: When they had mended the thoroughbrace we filled the two boots again , but put no mail on top , and only half as much inside as there was before .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 23]: The conductor bent all the seat-backs down , and then filled the coach just half full of mail-bags from end to end .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 13]: We objected loudly to this , for it left us no seats .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 27]: But the conductor was wiser than we , and said a bed was better than seats , and moreover , this plan would protect his thoroughbraces .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 8]: We never wanted any seats after that .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 7]: The lazy bed was infinitely preferable .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 28]: I had many an exciting day , subsequently , lying on it reading the statutes and the dictionary , and wondering how the characters would turn out .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 26]: The conductor said he would send back a guard from the next station to take charge of the abandoned mail-bags , and we drove on .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 64]: It was now just dawn ; and as we stretched our cramped legs full length on the mail sacks , and gazed out through the windows across the wide wastes of greensward clad in cool , powdery mist , to where there was an expectant look in the eastern horizon , our perfect enjoyment took the form of a tranquil and contented ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 50]: The stage whirled along at a spanking gait , the breeze flapping curtains and suspended coats in a most exhilarating way ; the cradle swayed and swung luxuriously , the pattering of the horses ' hoofs , the cracking of the driver 's whip , and his `` Hi-yi !
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 5]: g ` lang ! ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 88]: were music ; the spinning ground and the waltzing trees appeared to give us a mute hurrah as we went by , and then slack up and look after us with interest , or envy , or something ; and as we lay and smoked the pipe of peace and compared all this luxury with the years of tiresome city life that had gone before it , we felt that there was only one complete and satisfying happiness in the world , and we had found it .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 34]: After breakfast , at some station whose name I have forgotten , we three climbed up on the seat behind the driver , and let the conductor have our bed for a nap .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 38]: And by and by , when the sun made me drowsy , I lay down on my face on top of the coach , grasping the slender iron railing , and slept for an hour or more .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 12]: That will give one an appreciable idea of those matchless roads .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 31]: Instinct will make a sleeping man grip a fast hold of the railing when the stage jolts , but when it only swings and sways , no grip is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 38]: Overland drivers and conductors used to sit in their places and sleep thirty or forty minutes at a time , on good roads , while spinning along at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 8]: I saw them do it , often .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 21]: There was no danger about it ; a sleeping man will seize the irons in time when the coach jolts .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 20]: These men were hard worked , and it was not possible for them to stay awake all the time .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 26]: By and by we passed through Marysville , and over the Big Blue and Little Sandy ; thence about a mile , and entered Nebraska .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 22]: About a mile further on , we came to the Big Sandy -- one hundred and eighty miles from St. Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 41]: As the sun was going down , we saw the first specimen of an animal known familiarly over two thousand miles of mountain and desert -- from Kansas clear to the Pacific Ocean -- as the `` jackass rabbit . ''
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 5]: He is well named .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 46]: He is just like any other rabbit , except that he is from one third to twice as large , has longer legs in proportion to his size , and has the most preposterous ears that ever were mounted on any creature but a jackass .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 53]: When he is sitting quiet , thinking about his sins , or is absent-minded or unapprehensive of danger , his majestic ears project above him conspicuously ; but the breaking of a twig will scare him nearly to death , and then he tilts his ears back gently and starts for home .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 67]: All you can see , then , for the next minute , is his long gray form stretched out straight and `` streaking it '' through the low sage-brush , head erect , eyes right , and ears just canted a little to the rear , but showing you where the animal is , all the time , the same as if he carried a jib .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 30]: Now and then he makes a marvelous spring with his long legs , high over the stunted sage-brush , and scores a leap that would make a horse envious .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 19]: Presently he comes down to a long , graceful `` lope , '' and shortly he mysteriously disappears .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 32]: He has crouched behind a sage-bush , and will sit there and listen and tremble until you get within six feet of him , when he will get under way again .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 30]: But one must shoot at this creature once , if he wishes to see him throw his heart into his heels , and do the best he knows how .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 43]: He is frightened clear through , now , and he lays his long ears down on his back , straightens himself out like a yard-stick every spring he makes , and scatters miles behind him with an easy indifference that is enchanting .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 15]: Our party made this specimen `` hump himself , '' as the conductor said .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 57]: The secretary started him with a shot from the Colt ; I commenced spitting at him with my weapon ; and all in the same instant the old `` Allen 's '' whole broadside let go with a rattling crash , and it is not putting it too strong to say that the rabbit was frantic !
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 30]: He dropped his ears , set up his tail , and left for San Francisco at a speed which can only be described as a flash and a vanish !
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 13]: Long after he was out of sight we could hear him whiz .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 28]: I do not remember where we first came across `` sage-brush , '' but as I have been speaking of it I may as well describe it .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 49]: This is easily done , for if the reader can imagine a gnarled and venerable live oak-tree reduced to a little shrub two feet-high , with its rough bark , its foliage , its twisted boughs , all complete , he can picture the `` sage-brush '' exactly .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 70]: Often , on lazy afternoons in the mountains , I have lain on the ground with my face under a sage-bush , and entertained myself with fancying that the gnats among its foliage were liliputian birds , and that the ants marching and countermarching about its base were liliputian flocks and herds , and myself some vast loafer from Brobdignag waiting to catch a little citizen and eat him .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 18]: It is an imposing monarch of the forest in exquisite miniature , is the `` sage-brush . ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 16]: Its foliage is a grayish green , and gives that tint to desert and mountain .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 27]: It smells like our domestic sage , and `` sage-tea '' made from it taste like the sage-tea which all boys are so well acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 40]: The sage-brush is a singularly hardy plant , and grows right in the midst of deep sand , and among barren rocks , where nothing else in the vegetable world would try to grow , except `` bunch-grass . ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 73]: -- -LSB- `` Bunch-grass '' grows on the bleak mountain-sides of Nevada and neighboring territories , and offers excellent feed for stock , even in the dead of winter , wherever the snow is blown aside and exposes it ; notwithstanding its unpromising home , bunch-grass is a better and more nutritious diet for cattle and horses than almost any other hay or grass that is known -- so stock-men say . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 31]: -- The sage-bushes grow from three to six or seven feet apart , all over the mountains and deserts of the Far West , clear to the borders of California .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 53]: There is not a tree of any kind in the deserts , for hundreds of miles -- there is no vegetation at all in a regular desert , except the sage-brush and its cousin the `` greasewood , '' which is so much like the sage-brush that the difference amounts to little .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 16]: Camp-fires and hot suppers in the deserts would be impossible but for the friendly sage-brush .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 46]: Its trunk is as large as a boy 's wrist -LRB- and from that up to a man 's arm -RRB- , and its crooked branches are half as large as its trunk -- all good , sound , hard wood , very like oak .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 32]: When a party camps , the first thing to be done is to cut sage-brush ; and in a few minutes there is an opulent pile of it ready for use .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 37]: A hole a foot wide , two feet deep , and two feet long , is dug , and sage-brush chopped up and burned in it till it is full to the brim with glowing coals .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 16]: Then the cooking begins , and there is no smoke , and consequently no swearing .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 38]: Such a fire will keep all night , with very little replenishing ; and it makes a very sociable camp-fire , and one around which the most impossible reminiscences sound plausible , instructive , and profoundly entertaining .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 16]: Sage-brush is very fair fuel , but as a vegetable it is a distinguished failure .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 17]: Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and his illegitimate child the mule .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 55]: But their testimony to its nutritiousness is worth nothing , for they will eat pine knots , or anthracite coal , or brass filings , or lead pipe , or old bottles , or anything that comes handy , and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 17]: Mules and donkeys and camels have appetites that anything will relieve temporarily , but nothing satisfy .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 81]: In Syria , once , at the head-waters of the Jordan , a camel took charge of my overcoat while the tents were being pitched , and examined it with a critical eye , all over , with as much interest as if he had an idea of getting one made like it ; and then , after he was done figuring on it as an article of apparel , he began to contemplate it as an article of diet .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 64]: He put his foot on it , and lifted one of the sleeves out with his teeth , and chewed and chewed at it , gradually taking it in , and all the while opening and closing his eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy , as if he had never tasted anything as good as an overcoat before , in his life .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 16]: Then he smacked his lips once or twice , and reached after the other sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 32]: Next he tried the velvet collar , and smiled a smile of such contentment that it was plain to see that he regarded that as the daintiest thing about an overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 20]: The tails went next , along with some percussion caps and cough candy , and some fig-paste from Constantinople .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 24]: And then my newspaper correspondence dropped out , and he took a chance in that -- manuscript letters written for the home papers .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 10]: But he was treading on dangerous ground , now .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 76]: He began to come across solid wisdom in those documents that was rather weighty on his stomach ; and occasionally he would take a joke that would shake him up till it loosened his teeth ; it was getting to be perilous times with him , but he held his grip with good courage and hopefully , till at last he began to stumble on statements that not even a camel could swallow with impunity .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 47]: He began to gag and gasp , and his eyes to stand out , and his forelegs to spread , and in about a quarter of a minute he fell over as stiff as a carpenter 's work-bench , and died a death of indescribable agony .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 40]: I went and pulled the manuscript out of his mouth , and found that the sensitive creature had choked to death on one of the mildest and gentlest statements of fact that I ever laid before a trusting public .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 47]: I was about to say , when diverted from my subject , that occasionally one finds sage-bushes five or six feet high , and with a spread of branch and foliage in proportion , but two or two and a half feet is the usual height .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 18]: As the sun went down and the evening chill came on , we made preparation for bed .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 34]: We stirred up the hard leather letter-sacks , and the knotty canvas bags of printed matter -LRB- knotty and uneven because of projecting ends and corners of magazines , boxes and books -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 21]: We stirred them up and redisposed them in such a way as to make our bed as level as possible .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 32]: And we did improve it , too , though after all our work it had an upheaved and billowy look about it , like a little piece of a stormy sea .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 22]: Next we hunted up our boots from odd nooks among the mail-bags where they had settled , and put them on .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 72]: Then we got down our coats , vests , pantaloons and heavy woolen shirts , from the arm-loops where they had been swinging all day , and clothed ourselves in them -- for , there being no ladies either at the stations or in the coach , and the weather being hot , we had looked to our comfort by stripping to our underclothing , at nine o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 35]: All things being now ready , we stowed the uneasy Dictionary where it would lie as quiet as possible , and placed the water-canteens and pistols where we could find them in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 70]: Then we smoked a final pipe , and swapped a final yarn ; after which , we put the pipes , tobacco and bag of coin in snug holes and caves among the mail-bags , and then fastened down the coach curtains all around , and made the place as `` dark as the inside of a cow , '' as the conductor phrased it in his picturesque way .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 19]: It was certainly as dark as any place could be -- nothing was even dimly visible in it .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 23]: And finally , we rolled ourselves up like silk-worms , each person in his own blanket , and sank peacefully to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 41]: Whenever the stage stopped to change horses , we would wake up , and try to recollect where we were -- and succeed -- and in a minute or two the stage would be off again , and we likewise .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 17]: We began to get into country , now , threaded here and there with little streams .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 31]: These had high , steep banks on each side , and every time we flew down one bank and scrambled up the other , our party inside got mixed somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 41]: First we would all be down in a pile at the forward end of the stage , nearly in a sitting posture , and in a second we would shoot to the other end , and stand on our heads .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 68]: And we would sprawl and kick , too , and ward off ends and corners of mail-bags that came lumbering over us and about us ; and as the dust rose from the tumult , we would all sneeze in chorus , and the majority of us would grumble , and probably say some hasty thing , like : `` Take your elbow out of my ribs !
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 8]: -- ca n't you quit crowding ? ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 30]: Every time we avalanched from one end of the stage to the other , the Unabridged Dictionary would come too ; and every time it came it damaged somebody .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 41]: One trip it `` barked '' the Secretary 's elbow ; the next trip it hurt me in the stomach , and the third it tilted Bemis 's nose up till he could look down his nostrils -- he said .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 53]: The pistols and coin soon settled to the bottom , but the pipes , pipe-stems , tobacco and canteens clattered and floundered after the Dictionary every time it made an assault on us , and aided and abetted the book by spilling tobacco in our eyes , and water down our backs .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 13]: Still , all things considered , it was a very comfortable night .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 47]: It wore gradually away , and when at last a cold gray light was visible through the puckers and chinks in the curtains , we yawned and stretched with satisfaction , shed our cocoons , and felt that we had slept as much as was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 25]: By and by , as the sun rose up and warmed the world , we pulled off our clothes and got ready for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 39]: We were just pleasantly in time , for five minutes afterward the driver sent the weird music of his bugle winding over the grassy solitudes , and presently we detected a low hut or two in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 44]: Then the rattling of the coach , the clatter of our six horses ' hoofs , and the driver 's crisp commands , awoke to a louder and stronger emphasis , and we went sweeping down on the station at our smartest speed .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 9]: It was fascinating -- that old overland stagecoaching .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 7]: We jumped out in undress uniform .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 182]: The driver tossed his gathered reins out on the ground , gaped and stretched complacently , drew off his heavy buckskin gloves with great deliberation and insufferable dignity -- taking not the slightest notice of a dozen solicitous inquires after his health , and humbly facetious and flattering accostings , and obsequious tenders of service , from five or six hairy and half-civilized station-keepers and hostlers who were nimbly unhitching our steeds and bringing the fresh team out of the stables -- for in the eyes of the stage-driver of that day , station-keepers and hostlers were a sort of good enough low creatures , useful in their place , and helping to make up a world , but not the kind of beings which a person of distinction could afford to concern himself with ; while , on the contrary , in the eyes of the station-keeper and the hostler , the stage-driver was a hero -- a great and shining dignitary , the world 's favorite son , the envy of the people , the observed of the nations .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 155]: When they spoke to him they received his insolent silence meekly , and as being the natural and proper conduct of so great a man ; when he opened his lips they all hung on his words with admiration -LRB- he never honored a particular individual with a remark , but addressed it with a broad generality to the horses , the stables , the surrounding country and the human underlings -RRB- ; when he discharged a facetious insulting personality at a hostler , that hostler was happy for the day ; when he uttered his one jest -- old as the hills , coarse , profane , witless , and inflicted on the same audience , in the same language , every time his coach drove up there -- the varlets roared , and slapped their thighs , and swore it was the best thing they 'd ever heard in all their lives .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 27]: And how they would fly around when he wanted a basin of water , a gourd of the same , or a light for his pipe !
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 23]: -- but they would instantly insult a passenger if he so far forgot himself as to crave a favor at their hands .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 44]: They could do that sort of insolence as well as the driver they copied it from -- for , let it be borne in mind , the overland driver had but little less contempt for his passengers than he had for his hostlers .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 38]: The hostlers and station-keepers treated the really powerful conductor of the coach merely with the best of what was their idea of civility , but the driver was the only being they bowed down to and worshipped .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 40]: How admiringly they would gaze up at him in his high seat as he gloved himself with lingering deliberation , while some happy hostler held the bunch of reins aloft , and waited patiently for him to take it !
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 20]: And how they would bombard him with glorifying ejaculations as he cracked his long whip and went careering away .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 38]: The station buildings were long , low huts , made of sundried , mud-colored bricks , laid up without mortar -LRB- adobes , the Spaniards call these bricks , and Americans shorten it to ` dobies -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 40]: The roofs , which had no slant to them worth speaking of , were thatched and then sodded or covered with a thick layer of earth , and from this sprung a pretty rank growth of weeds and grass .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 20]: It was the first time we had ever seen a man 's front yard on top of his house .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 22]: The building consisted of barns , stable-room for twelve or fifteen horses , and a hut for an eating-room for passengers .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 15]: This latter had bunks in it for the station-keeper and a hostler or two .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 23]: You could rest your elbow on its eaves , and you had to bend in order to get in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 28]: In place of a window there was a square hole about large enough for a man to crawl through , but this had no glass in it .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 12]: There was no flooring , but the ground was packed hard .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 13]: There was no stove , but the fire-place served all needful purposes .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 11]: There were no shelves , no cupboards , no closets .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 41]: In a corner stood an open sack of flour , and nestling against its base were a couple of black and venerable tin coffee-pots , a tin teapot , a little bag of salt , and a side of bacon .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 20]: By the door of the station-keeper 's den , outside , was a tin wash-basin , on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 58]: Near it was a pail of water and a piece of yellow bar soap , and from the eaves hung a hoary blue woolen shirt , significantly -- but this latter was the station-keeper 's private towel , and only two persons in all the party might venture to use it -- the stage-driver and the conductor .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 28]: The latter would not , from a sense of decency ; the former would not , because did not choose to encourage the advances of a station-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 19]: We had towels -- in the valise ; they might as well have been in Sodom and Gomorrah .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 18]: We -LRB- and the conductor -RRB- used our handkerchiefs , and the driver his pantaloons and sleeves .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 30]: By the door , inside , was fastened a small old-fashioned looking-glass frame , with two little fragments of the original mirror lodged down in one corner of it .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 32]: This arrangement afforded a pleasant double-barreled portrait of you when you looked into it , with one half of your head set up a couple of inches above the other half .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 34]: From the glass frame hung the half of a comb by a string -- but if I had to describe that patriarch or die , I believe I would order some sample coffins .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 22]: It had come down from Esau and Samson , and had been accumulating hair ever since -- along with certain impurities .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 22]: In one corner of the room stood three or four rifles and muskets , together with horns and pouches of ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 56]: The station-men wore pantaloons of coarse , country-woven stuff , and into the seat and the inside of the legs were sewed ample additions of buckskin , to do duty in place of leggings , when the man rode horseback -- so the pants were half dull blue and half yellow , and unspeakably picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 32]: The pants were stuffed into the tops of high boots , the heels whereof were armed with great Spanish spurs , whose little iron clogs and chains jingled with every step .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 64]: The man wore a huge beard and mustachios , an old slouch hat , a blue woolen shirt , no suspenders , no vest , no coat -- in a leathern sheath in his belt , a great long `` navy '' revolver -LRB- slung on right side , hammer to the front -RRB- , and projecting from his boot a horn-handled bowie-knife .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 14]: The furniture of the hut was neither gorgeous nor much in the way .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 34]: The rocking-chairs and sofas were not present , and never had been , but they were represented by two three-legged stools , a pine-board bench four feet long , and two empty candle-boxes .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 28]: The table was a greasy board on stilts , and the table-cloth and napkins had not come -- and they were not looking for them , either .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 36]: A battered tin platter , a knife and fork , and a tin pint cup , were at each man 's place , and the driver had a queens-ware saucer that had seen better days .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 12]: Of course this duke sat at the head of the table .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 20]: There was one isolated piece of table furniture that bore about it a touching air of grandeur in misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 5]: This was the caster .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 45]: It was German silver , and crippled and rusty , but it was so preposterously out of place there that it was suggestive of a tattered exiled king among barbarians , and the majesty of its native position compelled respect even in its degradation .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 43]: There was only one cruet left , and that was a stopperless , fly-specked , broken-necked thing , with two inches of vinegar in it , and a dozen preserved flies with their heels up and looking sorry they had invested there .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 38]: The station-keeper upended a disk of last week 's bread , of the shape and size of an old-time cheese , and carved some slabs from it which were as good as Nicholson pavement , and tenderer .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 60]: He sliced off a piece of bacon for each man , but only the experienced old hands made out to eat it , for it was condemned army bacon which the United States would not feed to its soldiers in the forts , and the stage company had bought it cheap for the sustenance of their passengers and employees .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 33]: We may have found this condemned army bacon further out on the plains than the section I am locating it in , but we found it -- there is no gainsaying that .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 30]: Then he poured for us a beverage which he called `` Slum gullion , '' and it is hard to think he was not inspired when he named it .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 28]: It really pretended to be tea , but there was too much dish-rag , and sand , and old bacon-rind in it to deceive the intelligent traveler .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 18]: He had no sugar and no milk -- not even a spoon to stir the ingredients with .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 17]: We could not eat the bread or the meat , nor drink the `` slumgullion . ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 50]: And when I looked at that melancholy vinegar-cruet , I thought of the anecdote -LRB- a very , very old one , even at that day -RRB- of the traveler who sat down to a table which had nothing on it but a mackerel and a pot of mustard .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 9]: He asked the landlord if this was all .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 7]: The landlord said : `` All !
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 18]: Why , thunder and lightning , I should think there was mackerel enough there for six . ''
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 9]: `` But I do n't like mackerel . ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 11]: `` Oh -- then help yourself to the mustard . ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 36]: In other days I had considered it a good , a very good , anecdote , but there was a dismal plausibility about it , here , that took all the humor out of it .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 12]: Our breakfast was before us , but our teeth were idle .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 15]: I tasted and smelt , and said I would take coffee , I believed .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 12]: The station-boss stopped dead still , and glared at me speechless .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 31]: At last , when he came to , he turned away and said , as one who communes with himself upon a matter too vast to grasp : `` Coffee !
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 19]: Well , if that do n't go clean ahead of me , I 'm d -- d ! ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 24]: We could not eat , and there was no conversation among the hostlers and herdsmen -- we all sat at the same board .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 23]: At least there was no conversation further than a single hurried request , now and then , from one employee to another .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 13]: It was always in the same form , and always gruffly friendly .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 26]: Its western freshness and novelty startled me , at first , and interested me ; but it presently grew monotonous , and lost its charm .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 15]: It was : `` Pass the bread , you son of a skunk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 40]: No , I forget -- skunk was not the word ; it seems to me it was still stronger than that ; I know it was , in fact , but it is gone from my memory , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 17]: However , it is no matter -- probably it was too strong for print , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 25]: It is the landmark in my memory which tells me where I first encountered the vigorous new vernacular of the occidental plains and mountains .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 29]: We gave up the breakfast , and paid our dollar apiece and went back to our mail-bag bed in the coach , and found comfort in our pipes .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 12]: Right here we suffered the first diminution of our princely state .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 14]: We left our six fine horses and took six mules in their place .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 33]: But they were wild Mexican fellows , and a man had to stand at the head of each of them and hold him fast while the driver gloved and got himself ready .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 39]: And when at last he grasped the reins and gave the word , the men sprung suddenly away from the mules ' heads and the coach shot from the station as if it had issued from a cannon .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 7]: How the frantic animals did scamper !
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 37]: It was a fierce and furious gallop -- and the gait never altered for a moment till we reeled off ten or twelve miles and swept up to the next collection of little station-huts and stables .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 7]: So we flew along all day .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 28]: At 2 P.M. the belt of timber that fringes the North Platte and marks its windings through the vast level floor of the Plains came in sight .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 38]: At 4 P.M. we crossed a branch of the river , and at 5 P.M. we crossed the Platte itself , and landed at Fort Kearney , fifty-six hours out from St. Joe -- THREE HUNDRED MILES !
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 42]: Now that was stage-coaching on the great overland , ten or twelve years ago , when perhaps not more than ten men in America , all told , expected to live to see a railroad follow that route to the Pacific .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 46]: But the railroad is there , now , and it pictures a thousand odd comparisons and contrasts in my mind to read the following sketch , in the New York Times , of a recent trip over almost the very ground I have been describing .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 15]: I can scarcely comprehend the new state of things : `` ACROSS THE CONTINENT .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 24]: `` At 4.20 P.M. , Sunday , we rolled out of the station at Omaha , and started westward on our long jaunt .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 57]: A couple of hours out , dinner was announced -- an ` event ' to those of us who had yet to experience what it is to eat in one of Pullman 's hotels on wheels ; so , stepping into the car next forward of our sleeping palace , we found ourselves in the dining-car .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 13]: It was a revelation to us , that first dinner on Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 37]: And though we continued to dine for four days , and had as many breakfasts and suppers , our whole party never ceased to admire the perfection of the arrangements , and the marvelous results achieved .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 93]: Upon tables covered with snowy linen , and garnished with services of solid silver , Ethiop waiters , flitting about in spotless white , placed as by magic a repast at which Delmonico himself could have had no occasion to blush ; and , indeed , in some respects it would be hard for that distinguished chef to match our menu ; for , in addition to all that ordinarily makes up a first-chop dinner , had we not our antelope steak -LRB- the gormand who has not experienced this -- bah !
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 12]: what does he know of the feast of fat things ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 19]: our delicious mountain-brook trout , and choice fruits and berries , and -LRB- sauce piquant and unpurchasable ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 9]: our sweet-scented , appetite-compelling air of the prairies ?
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 52]: `` You may depend upon it , we all did justice to the good things , and as we washed them down with bumpers of sparkling Krug , whilst we sped along at the rate of thirty miles an hour , agreed it was the fastest living we had ever experienced .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 33]: -LRB- We beat that , however , two days afterward when we made twenty-seven miles in twenty-seven minutes , while our Champagne glasses filled to the brim spilled not a drop ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 90]: After dinner we repaired to our drawing-room car , and , as it was Sabbath eve , intoned some of the grand old hymns -- `` Praise God from whom , '' etc. ; `` Shining Shore , '' `` Coronation , '' etc. -- the voices of the men singers and of the women singers blending sweetly in the evening air , while our train , with its great , glaring Polyphemus eye , lighting up long vistas of prairie , rushed into the night and the Wild .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 53]: Then to bed in luxurious couches , where we slept the sleep of the just and only awoke the next morning -LRB- Monday -RRB- at eight o'clock , to find ourselves at the crossing of the North Platte , three hundred miles from Omaha -- fifteen hours and forty minutes out . ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 10]: CHAPTER V. Another night of alternate tranquillity and turmoil .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 8]: But morning came , by and by .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 52]: It was another glad awakening to fresh breezes , vast expanses of level greensward , bright sunlight , an impressive solitude utterly without visible human beings or human habitations , and an atmosphere of such amazing magnifying properties that trees that seemed close at hand were more than three mile away .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 69]: We resumed undress uniform , climbed a-top of the flying coach , dangled our legs over the side , shouted occasionally at our frantic mules , merely to see them lay their ears back and scamper faster , tied our hats on to keep our hair from blowing away , and leveled an outlook over the world-wide carpet about us for things new and strange to gaze at .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 40]: Even at this day it thrills me through and through to think of the life , the gladness and the wild sense of freedom that used to make the blood dance in my veins on those fine overland mornings !
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 22]: Along about an hour after breakfast we saw the first prairie-dog villages , the first antelope , and the first wolf .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 20]: If I remember rightly , this latter was the regular cayote -LRB- pronounced ky-o-te -RRB- of the farther deserts .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 31]: And if it was , he was not a pretty creature or respectable either , for I got well acquainted with his race afterward , and can speak with confidence .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 59]: The cayote is a long , slim , sick and sorry-looking skeleton , with a gray wolf-skin stretched over it , a tolerably bushy tail that forever sags down with a despairing expression of forsakenness and misery , a furtive and evil eye , and a long , sharp face , with slightly lifted lip and exposed teeth .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 9]: He has a general slinking expression all over .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 11]: The cayote is a living , breathing allegory of Want .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 5]: He is always hungry .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 11]: He is always poor , out of luck and friendless .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 17]: The meanest creatures despise him , and even the fleas would desert him for a velocipede .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 27]: He is so spiritless and cowardly that even while his exposed teeth are pretending a threat , the rest of his face is apologizing for it .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 6]: And he is so homely !
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 13]: -- so scrawny , and ribby , and coarse-haired , and pitiful .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 116]: When he sees you he lifts his lip and lets a flash of his teeth out , and then turns a little out of the course he was pursuing , depresses his head a bit , and strikes a long , soft-footed trot through the sage-brush , glancing over his shoulder at you , from time to time , till he is about out of easy pistol range , and then he stops and takes a deliberate survey of you ; he will trot fifty yards and stop again -- another fifty and stop again ; and finally the gray of his gliding body blends with the gray of the sage-brush , and he disappears .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 112]: All this is when you make no demonstration against him ; but if you do , he develops a livelier interest in his journey , and instantly electrifies his heels and puts such a deal of real estate between himself and your weapon , that by the time you have raised the hammer you see that you need a minie rifle , and by the time you have got him in line you need a rifled cannon , and by the time you have `` drawn a bead '' on him you see well enough that nothing but an unusually long-winded streak of lightning could reach him where he is now .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 45]: But if you start a swift-footed dog after him , you will enjoy it ever so much -- especially if it is a dog that has a good opinion of himself , and has been brought up to think he knows something about speed .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 113]: The cayote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot of his , and every little while he will smile a fraudful smile over his shoulder that will fill that dog entirely full of encouragement and worldly ambition , and make him lay his head still lower to the ground , and stretch his neck further to the front , and pant more fiercely , and stick his tail out straighter behind , and move his furious legs with a yet wilder frenzy , and leave a broader and broader , and higher and denser cloud of desert sand smoking behind , and marking his long wake across the level plain !
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 173]: And all this time the dog is only a short twenty feet behind the cayote , and to save the soul of him he can not understand why it is that he can not get perceptibly closer ; and he begins to get aggravated , and it makes him madder and madder to see how gently the cayote glides along and never pants or sweats or ceases to smile ; and he grows still more and more incensed to see how shamefully he has been taken in by an entire stranger , and what an ignoble swindle that long , calm , soft-footed trot is ; and next he notices that he is getting fagged , and that the cayote actually has to slacken speed a little to keep from running away from him -- and then that town-dog is mad in earnest , and he begins to strain and weep and swear , and paw the sand higher than ever , and reach for the cayote with concentrated and desperate energy .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 20]: This `` spurt '' finds him six feet behind the gliding enemy , and two miles from his friends .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 111]: And then , in the instant that a wild new hope is lighting up his face , the cayote turns and smiles blandly upon him once more , and with a something about it which seems to say : `` Well , I shall have to tear myself away from you , bub -- business is business , and it will not do for me to be fooling along this way all day '' -- and forthwith there is a rushing sound , and the sudden splitting of a long crack through the atmosphere , and behold that dog is solitary and alone in the midst of a vast solitude !
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 6]: It makes his head swim .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 71]: He stops , and looks all around ; climbs the nearest sand-mound , and gazes into the distance ; shakes his head reflectively , and then , without a word , he turns and jogs along back to his train , and takes up a humble position under the hindmost wagon , and feels unspeakably mean , and looks ashamed , and hangs his tail at half-mast for a week .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 52]: And for as much as a year after that , whenever there is a great hue and cry after a cayote , that dog will merely glance in that direction without emotion , and apparently observe to himself , `` I believe I do not wish any of the pie . ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 35]: The cayote lives chiefly in the most desolate and forbidding desert , along with the lizard , the jackass-rabbit and the raven , and gets an uncertain and precarious living , and earns it .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 58]: He seems to subsist almost wholly on the carcases of oxen , mules and horses that have dropped out of emigrant trains and died , and upon windfalls of carrion , and occasional legacies of offal bequeathed to him by white men who have been opulent enough to have something better to butcher than condemned army bacon .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 28]: He will eat anything in the world that his first cousins , the desert-frequenting tribes of Indians will , and they will eat anything they can bite .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 27]: It is a curious fact that these latter are the only creatures known to history who will eat nitro-glycerine and ask for more if they survive .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 96]: The cayote of the deserts beyond the Rocky Mountains has a peculiarly hard time of it , owing to the fact that his relations , the Indians , are just as apt to be the first to detect a seductive scent on the desert breeze , and follow the fragrance to the late ox it emanated from , as he is himself ; and when this occurs he has to content himself with sitting off at a little distance watching those people strip off and dig out everything edible , and walk off with it .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 14]: Then he and the waiting ravens explore the skeleton and polish the bones .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 59]: It is considered that the cayote , and the obscene bird , and the Indian of the desert , testify their blood kinship with each other in that they live together in the waste places of the earth on terms of perfect confidence and friendship , while hating all other creature and yearning to assist at their funerals .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 59]: He does not mind going a hundred miles to breakfast , and a hundred and fifty to dinner , because he is sure to have three or four days between meals , and he can just as well be traveling and looking at the scenery as lying around doing nothing and adding to the burdens of his parents .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 62]: We soon learned to recognize the sharp , vicious bark of the cayote as it came across the murky plain at night to disturb our dreams among the mail-sacks ; and remembering his forlorn aspect and his hard fortune , made shift to wish him the blessed novelty of a long day 's good luck and a limitless larder the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 15]: Our new conductor -LRB- just shipped -RRB- had been without sleep for twenty hours .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 7]: Such a thing was very frequent .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 69]: From St. Joseph , Missouri , to Sacramento , California , by stage-coach , was nearly nineteen hundred miles , and the trip was often made in fifteen days -LRB- the cars do it in four and a half , now -RRB- , but the time specified in the mail contracts , and required by the schedule , was eighteen or nineteen days , if I remember rightly .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 19]: This was to make fair allowance for winter storms and snows , and other unavoidable causes of detention .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 12]: The stage company had everything under strict discipline and good system .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 23]: Over each two hundred and fifty miles of road they placed an agent or superintendent , and invested him with great authority .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 17]: His beat or jurisdiction of two hundred and fifty miles was called a `` division . ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 38]: He purchased horses , mules harness , and food for men and beasts , and distributed these things among his stage stations , from time to time , according to his judgment of what each station needed .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 8]: He erected station buildings and dug wells .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 22]: He attended to the paying of the station-keepers , hostlers , drivers and blacksmiths , and discharged them whenever he chose .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 55]: He was a very , very great man in his `` division '' -- a kind of Grand Mogul , a Sultan of the Indies , in whose presence common men were modest of speech and manner , and in the glare of whose greatness even the dazzling stage-driver dwindled to a penny dip .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 16]: There were about eight of these kings , all told , on the overland route .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 14]: Next in rank and importance to the division-agent came the `` conductor . ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 17]: His beat was the same length as the agent 's -- two hundred and fifty miles .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 39]: He sat with the driver , and -LRB- when necessary -RRB- rode that fearful distance , night and day , without other rest or sleep than what he could get perched thus on top of the flying vehicle .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 4]: Think of it !
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 33]: He had absolute charge of the mails , express matter , passengers and stage , coach , until he delivered them to the next conductor , and got his receipt for them .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 16]: Consequently he had to be a man of intelligence , decision and considerable executive ability .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 25]: He was usually a quiet , pleasant man , who attended closely to his duties , and was a good deal of a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 19]: It was not absolutely necessary that the division-agent should be a gentleman , and occasionally he was n't .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 61]: But he was always a general in administrative ability , and a bull-dog in courage and determination -- otherwise the chieftainship over the lawless underlings of the overland service would never in any instance have been to him anything but an equivalent for a month of insolence and distress and a bullet and a coffin at the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 27]: There were about sixteen or eighteen conductors on the overland , for there was a daily stage each way , and a conductor on every stage .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 58]: Next in real and official rank and importance , after the conductor , came my delight , the driver -- next in real but not in apparent importance -- for we have seen that in the eyes of the common herd the driver was to the conductor as an admiral is to the captain of the flag-ship .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 47]: The driver 's beat was pretty long , and his sleeping-time at the stations pretty short , sometimes ; and so , but for the grandeur of his position his would have been a sorry life , as well as a hard and a wearing one .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 68]: We took a new driver every day or every night -LRB- for they drove backward and forward over the same piece of road all the time -RRB- , and therefore we never got as well acquainted with them as we did with the conductors ; and besides , they would have been above being familiar with such rubbish as passengers , anyhow , as a general thing .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 62]: Still , we were always eager to get a sight of each and every new driver as soon as the watch changed , for each and every day we were either anxious to get rid of an unpleasant one , or loath to part with a driver we had learned to like and had come to be sociable and friendly with .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 29]: And so the first question we asked the conductor whenever we got to where we were to exchange drivers , was always , `` Which is him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 25]: The grammar was faulty , maybe , but we could not know , then , that it would go into a book some day .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 79]: As long as everything went smoothly , the overland driver was well enough situated , but if a fellow driver got sick suddenly it made trouble , for the coach must go on , and so the potentate who was about to climb down and take a luxurious rest after his long night 's siege in the midst of wind and rain and darkness , had to stay where he was and do the sick man 's work .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 69]: Once , in the Rocky Mountains , when I found a driver sound asleep on the box , and the mules going at the usual break-neck pace , the conductor said never mind him , there was no danger , and he was doing double duty -- had driven seventy-five miles on one coach , and was now going back over it on this without rest or sleep .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 20]: A hundred and fifty miles of holding back of six vindictive mules and keeping them from climbing the trees !
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 12]: It sounds incredible , but I remember the statement well enough .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 61]: The station-keepers , hostlers , etc. , were low , rough characters , as already described ; and from western Nebraska to Nevada a considerable sprinkling of them might be fairly set down as outlaws -- fugitives from justice , criminals whose best security was a section of country which was without law and without even the pretence of it .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 47]: When the `` division-agent '' issued an order to one of these parties he did it with the full understanding that he might have to enforce it with a navy six-shooter , and so he always went `` fixed '' to make things go along smoothly .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 39]: Now and then a division-agent was really obliged to shoot a hostler through the head to teach him some simple matter that he could have taught him with a club if his circumstances and surroundings had been different .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 32]: But they were snappy , able men , those division-agents , and when they tried to teach a subordinate anything , that subordinate generally `` got it through his head . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 31]: A great portion of this vast machinery -- these hundreds of men and coaches , and thousands of mules and horses -- was in the hands of Mr. Ben Holliday .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 12]: All the western half of the business was in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 86]: This reminds me of an incident of Palestine travel which is pertinent here , so I will transfer it just in the language in which I find it set down in my Holy Land note-book : No doubt everybody has heard of Ben Holliday -- a man of prodigious energy , who used to send mails and passengers flying across the continent in his overland stage-coaches like a very whirlwind -- two thousand long miles in fifteen days and a half , by the watch !
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 72]: But this fragment of history is not about Ben Holliday , but about a young New York boy by the name of Jack , who traveled with our small party of pilgrims in the Holy Land -LRB- and who had traveled to California in Mr. Holliday 's overland coaches three years before , and had by no means forgotten it or lost his gushing admiration of Mr. H. -RRB- Aged nineteen .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 79]: Jack was a good boy -- a good-hearted and always well-meaning boy , who had been reared in the city of New York , and although he was bright and knew a great many useful things , his Scriptural education had been a good deal neglected -- to such a degree , indeed , that all Holy Land history was fresh and new to him , and all Bible names mysteries that had never disturbed his virgin ear .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 29]: Also in our party was an elderly pilgrim who was the reverse of Jack , in that he was learned in the Scriptures and an enthusiast concerning them .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 22]: He was our encyclopedia , and we were never tired of listening to his speeches , nor he of making them .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 19]: He never passed a celebrated locality , from Bashan to Bethlehem , without illuminating it with an oration .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 37]: One day , when camped near the ruins of Jericho , he burst forth with something like this : `` Jack , do you see that range of mountains over yonder that bounds the Jordan valley ?
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 7]: The mountains of Moab , Jack !
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 18]: Think of it , my boy -- the actual mountains of Moab -- renowned in Scripture history !
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 48]: We are actually standing face to face with those illustrious crags and peaks -- and for all we know '' -LSB- dropping his voice impressively -RSB- , `` our eyes may be resting at this very moment upon the spot WHERE LIES THE MYSTERIOUS GRAVE OF MOSES !
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 7]: Think of it , Jack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 5]: `` Moses who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 5]: -LRB- falling inflection -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 4]: `` Moses who !
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 20]: Jack , you ought to be ashamed of yourself -- you ought to be ashamed of such criminal ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 17]: Why , Moses , the great guide , soldier , poet , lawgiver of ancient Israel !
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 35]: Jack , from this spot where we stand , to Egypt , stretches a fearful desert three hundred miles in extent -- and across that desert that wonderful man brought the children of Israel !
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 53]: -- guiding them with unfailing sagacity for forty years over the sandy desolation and among the obstructing rocks and hills , and landed them at last , safe and sound , within sight of this very spot ; and where we now stand they entered the Promised Land with anthems of rejoicing !
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 12]: It was a wonderful , wonderful thing to do , Jack !
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 5]: Think of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 4]: `` Forty years ?
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 5]: Only three hundred miles ?
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 2]: Humph !
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 12]: Ben Holliday would have fetched them through in thirty-six hours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 6]: The boy meant no harm .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 15]: He did not know that he had said anything that was wrong or irreverent .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 29]: And so no one scolded him or felt offended with him -- and nobody could but some ungenerous spirit incapable of excusing the heedless blunders of a boy .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 61]: At noon on the fifth day out , we arrived at the `` Crossing of the South Platte , '' alias `` Julesburg , '' alias `` Overland City , '' four hundred and seventy miles from St. Joseph -- the strangest , quaintest , funniest frontier town that our untraveled eyes had ever stared at and been astonished with .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 30]: It did seem strange enough to see a town again after what appeared to us such a long acquaintance with deep , still , almost lifeless and houseless solitude !
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 27]: We tumbled out into the busy street feeling like meteoric people crumbled off the corner of some other world , and wakened up suddenly in this .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 21]: For an hour we took as much interest in Overland City as if we had never seen a town before .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 36]: The reason we had an hour to spare was because we had to change our stage -LRB- for a less sumptuous affair , called a `` mud-wagon '' -RRB- and transfer our freight of mails .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 7]: Presently we got under way again .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 62]: We came to the shallow , yellow , muddy South Platte , with its low banks and its scattering flat sand-bars and pigmy islands -- a melancholy stream straggling through the centre of the enormous flat plain , and only saved from being impossible to find with the naked eye by its sentinel rank of scattering trees standing on either bank .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 32]: The Platte was `` up , '' they said -- which made me wish I could see it when it was down , if it could look any sicker and sorrier .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 34]: They said it was a dangerous stream to cross , now , because its quicksands were liable to swallow up horses , coach and passengers if an attempt was made to ford it .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 13]: But the mails had to go , and we made the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 45]: Once or twice in midstream the wheels sunk into the yielding sands so threateningly that we half believed we had dreaded and avoided the sea all our lives to be shipwrecked in a `` mud-wagon '' in the middle of a desert at last .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 12]: But we dragged through and sped away toward the setting sun .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 23]: Next morning , just before dawn , when about five hundred and fifty miles from St. Joseph , our mud-wagon broke down .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 32]: We were to be delayed five or six hours , and therefore we took horses , by invitation , and joined a party who were just starting on a buffalo hunt .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 54]: It was noble sport galloping over the plain in the dewy freshness of the morning , but our part of the hunt ended in disaster and disgrace , for a wounded buffalo bull chased the passenger Bemis nearly two miles , and then he forsook his horse and took to a lone tree .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 51]: He was very sullen about the matter for some twenty-four hours , but at last he began to soften little by little , and finally he said : `` Well , it was not funny , and there was no sense in those gawks making themselves so facetious over it .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 11]: I tell you I was angry in earnest for awhile .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 43]: I should have shot that long gangly lubber they called Hank , if I could have done it without crippling six or seven other people -- but of course I could n't , the old ` Allen 's ' so confounded comprehensive .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 20]: I wish those loafers had been up in the tree ; they would n't have wanted to laugh so .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 41]: If I had had a horse worth a cent -- but no , the minute he saw that buffalo bull wheel on him and give a bellow , he raised straight up in the air and stood on his heels .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 24]: The saddle began to slip , and I took him round the neck and laid close to him , and began to pray .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 28]: Then he came down and stood up on the other end awhile , and the bull actually stopped pawing sand and bellowing to contemplate the inhuman spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 69]: `` Then the bull made a pass at him and uttered a bellow that sounded perfectly frightful , it was so close to me , and that seemed to literally prostrate my horse 's reason , and make a raving distracted maniac of him , and I wish I may die if he did n't stand on his head for a quarter of a minute and shed tears .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 28]: He was absolutely out of his mind -- he was , as sure as truth itself , and he really did n't know what he was doing .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 94]: Then the bull came charging at us , and my horse dropped down on all fours and took a fresh start -- and then for the next ten minutes he would actually throw one hand-spring after another so fast that the bull began to get unsettled , too , and did n't know where to start in -- and so he stood there sneezing , and shovelling dust over his back , and bellowing every now and then , and thinking he had got a fifteen-hundred dollar circus horse for breakfast , certain .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 67]: Well , I was first out on his neck -- the horse 's , not the bull 's -- and then underneath , and next on his rump , and sometimes head up , and sometimes heels -- but I tell you it seemed solemn and awful to be ripping and tearing and carrying on so in the presence of death , as you might say .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 54]: Pretty soon the bull made a snatch for us and brought away some of my horse 's tail -LRB- I suppose , but do not know , being pretty busy at the time -RRB- , but something made him hungry for solitude and suggested to him to get up and hunt for it .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 15]: `` And then you ought to have seen that spider legged old skeleton go !
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 50]: and you ought to have seen the bull cut out after him , too -- head down , tongue out , tail up , bellowing like everything , and actually mowing down the weeds , and tearing up the earth , and boosting up the sand like a whirlwind !
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 9]: By George , it was a hot race !
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 28]: I and the saddle were back on the rump , and I had the bridle in my teeth and holding on to the pommel with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 88]: First we left the dogs behind ; then we passed a jackass rabbit ; then we overtook a cayote , and were gaining on an antelope when the rotten girth let go and threw me about thirty yards off to the left , and as the saddle went down over the horse 's rump he gave it a lift with his heels that sent it more than four hundred yards up in the air , I wish I may die in a minute if he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 75]: I fell at the foot of the only solitary tree there was in nine counties adjacent -LRB- as any creature could see with the naked eye -RRB- , and the next second I had hold of the bark with four sets of nails and my teeth , and the next second after that I was astraddle of the main limb and blaspheming my luck in a way that made my breath smell of brimstone .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 16]: I had the bull , now , if he did not think of one thing .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 7]: But that one thing I dreaded .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 6]: I dreaded it very seriously .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 22]: There was a possibility that the bull might not think of it , but there were greater chances that he would .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 14]: I made up my mind what I would do in case he did .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 15]: It was a little over forty feet to the ground from where I sat .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 17]: I cautiously unwound the lariat from the pommel of my saddle -- '' `` Your saddle ?
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 13]: Did you take your saddle up in the tree with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 10]: `` Take it up in the tree with me ?
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 6]: Why , how you talk .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 6]: Of course I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 6]: No man could do that .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 11]: It fell in the tree when it came down . ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 6]: `` Oh -- exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 15]: I unwound the lariat , and fastened one end of it to the limb .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 14]: It was the very best green raw-hide , and capable of sustaining tons .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 19]: I made a slip-noose in the other end , and then hung it down to see the length .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 12]: It reached down twenty-two feet -- half way to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 13]: I then loaded every barrel of the Allen with a double charge .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 4]: I felt satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 35]: I said to myself , if he never thinks of that one thing that I dread , all right -- but if he does , all right anyhow -- I am fixed for him .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 19]: But do n't you know that the very thing a man dreads is the thing that always happens ?
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 5]: Indeed it is so .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 35]: I watched the bull , now , with anxiety -- anxiety which no one can conceive of who has not been in such a situation and felt that at any moment death might come .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 10]: Presently a thought came into the bull 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 4]: I knew it !
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 13]: said I -- if my nerve fails now , I am lost .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 27]: Sure enough , it was just as I had dreaded , he started in to climb the tree -- '' `` What , the bull ? ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 8]: `` Of course -- who else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 11]: `` But a bull ca n't climb a tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 9]: `` He ca n't , ca n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 17]: Since you know so much about it , did you ever see a bull try ? ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 9]: I never dreamt of such a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 17]: `` Well , then , what is the use of your talking that way , then ?
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 20]: Because you never saw a thing done , is that any reason why it ca n't be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 9]: `` Well , all right -- go on .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 6]: What did you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 21]: `` The bull started up , and got along well for about ten feet , then slipped and slid back .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 4]: I breathed easier .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 14]: He tried it again -- got up a little higher -- slipped again .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 15]: But he came at it once more , and this time he was careful .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 16]: He got gradually higher and higher , and my spirits went down more and more .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 21]: Up he came -- an inch at a time -- with his eyes hot , and his tongue hanging out .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 33]: Higher and higher -- hitched his foot over the stump of a limb , and looked up , as much as to say , ` You are my meat , friend . '
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 16]: Up again -- higher and higher , and getting more excited the closer he got .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 8]: He was within ten feet of me !
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 20]: I took a long breath , -- and then said I , ` It is now or never . '
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 44]: I had the coil of the lariat all ready ; I paid it out slowly , till it hung right over his head ; all of a sudden I let go of the slack , and the slipnoose fell fairly round his neck !
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 17]: Quicker than lightning I out with the Allen and let him have it in the face .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 17]: It was an awful roar , and must have scared the bull out of his senses .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 35]: When the smoke cleared away , there he was , dangling in the air , twenty foot from the ground , and going out of one convulsion into another faster than you could count !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 20]: I did n't stop to count , anyhow -- I shinned down the tree and shot for home . ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 16]: `` Bemis , is all that true , just as you have stated it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 22]: `` I wish I may rot in my tracks and die the death of a dog if it is n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 16]: `` Well , we ca n't refuse to believe it , and we do n't .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 11]: But if there were some proofs -- '' `` Proofs !
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 8]: Did I bring back my lariat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 9]: `` Did I bring back my horse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 10]: `` Did you ever see the bull again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 11]: `` Well , then , what more do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 17]: I never saw anybody as particular as you are about a little thing like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 24]: I made up my mind that if this man was not a liar he only missed it by the skin of his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 17]: This episode reminds me of an incident of my brief sojourn in Siam , years afterward .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 40]: The European citizens of a town in the neighborhood of Bangkok had a prodigy among them by the name of Eckert , an Englishman -- a person famous for the number , ingenuity and imposing magnitude of his lies .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 26]: They were always repeating his most celebrated falsehoods , and always trying to `` draw him out '' before strangers ; but they seldom succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 22]: Twice he was invited to the house where I was visiting , but nothing could seduce him into a specimen lie .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 31]: One day a planter named Bascom , an influential man , and a proud and sometimes irascible one , invited me to ride over with him and call on Eckert .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 19]: As we jogged along , said he : `` Now , do you know where the fault lies ?
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 9]: It lies in putting Eckert on his guard .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 27]: The minute the boys go to pumping at Eckert he knows perfectly well what they are after , and of course he shuts up his shell .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 6]: Anybody might know he would .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 14]: But when we get there , we must play him finer than that .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 21]: Let him shape the conversation to suit himself -- let him drop it or change it whenever he wants to .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 12]: Let him see that nobody is trying to draw him out .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 8]: Just let him have his own way .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 15]: He will soon forget himself and begin to grind out lies like a mill .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 15]: Do n't get impatient -- just keep quiet , and let me play him .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 6]: I will make him lie .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 23]: It does seem to me that the boys must be blind to overlook such an obvious and simple trick as that . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 11]: Eckert received us heartily -- a pleasant-spoken , gentle-mannered creature .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 66]: We sat in the veranda an hour , sipping English ale , and talking about the king , and the sacred white elephant , the Sleeping Idol , and all manner of things ; and I noticed that my comrade never led the conversation himself or shaped it , but simply followed Eckert 's lead , and betrayed no solicitude and no anxiety about anything .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 6]: The effect was shortly perceptible .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 23]: Eckert began to grow communicative ; he grew more and more at his ease , and more and more talkative and sociable .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 24]: Another hour passed in the same way , and then all of a sudden Eckert said : `` Oh , by the way !
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 5]: I came near forgetting .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 10]: I have got a thing here to astonish you .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 24]: Such a thing as neither you nor any other man ever heard of -- I 've got a cat that will eat cocoanut !
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 16]: Common green cocoanut -- and not only eat the meat , but drink the milk .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 11]: It is so -- I 'll swear to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 29]: A quick glance from Bascom -- a glance that I understood -- then : `` Why , bless my soul , I never heard of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 7]: Man , it is impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 8]: `` I knew you would say it .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 7]: I 'll fetch the cat . ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 6]: He went in the house .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 12]: Bascom said : `` There -- what did I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 10]: Now , that is the way to handle Eckert .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 17]: You see , I have petted him along patiently , and put his suspicions to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 6]: I am glad we came .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 11]: You tell the boys about it when you go back .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 9]: Cat eat a cocoanut -- oh , my !
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 28]: Now , that is just his way , exactly -- he will tell the absurdest lie , and trust to luck to get out of it again .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 11]: `` Cat eat a cocoanut -- the innocent fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 9]: Eckert approached with his cat , sure enough .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 3]: Bascom smiled .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 16]: Said he : `` I 'll hold the cat -- you bring a cocoanut . ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 11]: Eckert split one open , and chopped up some pieces .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 17]: Bascom smuggled a wink to me , and proffered a slice of the fruit to puss .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 13]: She snatched it , swallowed it ravenously , and asked for more !
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 12]: We rode our two miles in silence , and wide apart .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 26]: At least I was silent , though Bascom cuffed his horse and cursed him a good deal , notwithstanding the horse was behaving well enough .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 16]: When I branched off homeward , Bascom said : `` Keep the horse till morning .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 15]: And -- you need not speak of this -- foolishness to the boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 44]: In a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our necks and watching for the `` pony-rider '' -- the fleet messenger who sped across the continent from St. Joe to Sacramento , carrying letters nineteen hundred miles in eight days !
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 14]: Think of that for perishable horse and human flesh and blood to do !
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 17]: The pony-rider was usually a little bit of a man , brimful of spirit and endurance .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 86]: No matter what time of the day or night his watch came on , and no matter whether it was winter or summer , raining , snowing , hailing , or sleeting , or whether his `` beat '' was a level straight road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices , or whether it led through peaceful regions or regions that swarmed with hostile Indians , he must be always ready to leap into the saddle and be off like the wind !
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 10]: There was no idling-time for a pony-rider on duty .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 26]: He rode fifty miles without stopping , by daylight , moonlight , starlight , or through the blackness of darkness -- just as it happened .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 90]: He rode a splendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a gentleman ; kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles , and then , as he came crashing up to the station where stood two men holding fast a fresh , impatient steed , the transfer of rider and mail-bag was made in the twinkling of an eye , and away flew the eager pair and were out of sight before the spectator could get hardly the ghost of a look .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 10]: Both rider and horse went `` flying light . ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 33]: The rider 's dress was thin , and fitted close ; he wore a `` round-about , '' and a skull-cap , and tucked his pantaloons into his boot-tops like a race-rider .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 29]: He carried no arms -- he carried nothing that was not absolutely necessary , for even the postage on his literary freight was worth five dollars a letter .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 19]: He got but little frivolous correspondence to carry -- his bag had business letters in it , mostly .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 11]: His horse was stripped of all unnecessary weight , too .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 14]: He wore a little wafer of a racing-saddle , and no visible blanket .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 10]: He wore light shoes , or none at all .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 22]: The little flat mail-pockets strapped under the rider 's thighs would each hold about the bulk of a child 's primer .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 36]: They held many and many an important business chapter and newspaper letter , but these were written on paper as airy and thin as gold-leaf , nearly , and thus bulk and weight were economized .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 27]: The stage-coach traveled about a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five miles a day -LRB- twenty-four hours -RRB- , the pony-rider about two hundred and fifty .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 63]: There were about eighty pony-riders in the saddle all the time , night and day , stretching in a long , scattering procession from Missouri to California , forty flying eastward , and forty toward the west , and among them making four hundred gallant horses earn a stirring livelihood and see a deal of scenery every single day in the year .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 68]: We had had a consuming desire , from the beginning , to see a pony-rider , but somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us managed to streak by in the night , and so we heard only a whiz and a hail , and the swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our heads out of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 18]: But now we were expecting one along every moment , and would see him in broad daylight .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 11]: Presently the driver exclaims : `` HERE HE COMES ! ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 12]: Every neck is stretched further , and every eye strained wider .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 25]: Away across the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears against the sky , and it is plain that it moves .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 7]: Well , I should think so !
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 102]: In a second or two it becomes a horse and rider , rising and falling , rising and falling -- sweeping toward us nearer and nearer -- growing more and more distinct , more and more sharply defined -- nearer and still nearer , and the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the ear -- another instant a whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck , a wave of the rider 's hand , but no reply , and man and horse burst past our excited faces , and go winging away like a belated fragment of a storm !
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 57]: So sudden is it all , and so like a flash of unreal fancy , that but for the flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a mail-sack after the vision had flashed by and disappeared , we might have doubted whether we had seen any actual horse and man at all , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 12]: We rattled through Scott 's Bluffs Pass , by and by .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 45]: It was along here somewhere that we first came across genuine and unmistakable alkali water in the road , and we cordially hailed it as a first-class curiosity , and a thing to be mentioned with eclat in letters to the ignorant at home .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 23]: This water gave the road a soapy appearance , and in many places the ground looked as if it had been whitewashed .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 55]: I think the strange alkali water excited us as much as any wonder we had come upon yet , and I know we felt very complacent and conceited , and better satisfied with life after we had added it to our list of things which we had seen and some other people had not .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 43]: In a small way we were the same sort of simpletons as those who climb unnecessarily the perilous peaks of Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn , and derive no pleasure from it except the reflection that it is n't a common experience .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 164]: But once in a while one of those parties trips and comes darting down the long mountain-crags in a sitting posture , making the crusted snow smoke behind him , flitting from bench to bench , and from terrace to terrace , jarring the earth where he strikes , and still glancing and flitting on again , sticking an iceberg into himself every now and then , and tearing his clothes , snatching at things to save himself , taking hold of trees and fetching them along with him , roots and all , starting little rocks now and then , then big boulders , then acres of ice and snow and patches of forest , gathering and still gathering as he goes , adding and still adding to his massed and sweeping grandeur as he nears a three thousand-foot precipice , till at last he waves his hat magnificently and rides into eternity on the back of a raging and tossing avalanche !
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 49]: This is all very fine , but let us not be carried away by excitement , but ask calmly , how does this person feel about it in his cooler moments next day , with six or seven thousand feet of snow and stuff on top of him ?
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 80]: We crossed the sand hills near the scene of the Indian mail robbery and massacre of 1856 , wherein the driver and conductor perished , and also all the passengers but one , it was supposed ; but this must have been a mistake , for at different times afterward on the Pacific coast I was personally acquainted with a hundred and thirty-three or four people who were wounded during that massacre , and barely escaped with their lives .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 18]: There was no doubt of the truth of it -- I had it from their own lips .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 67]: One of these parties told me that he kept coming across arrow-heads in his system for nearly seven years after the massacre ; and another of them told me that he was struck so literally full of arrows that after the Indians were gone and he could raise up and examine himself , he could not restrain his tears , for his clothes were completely ruined .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 28]: The most trustworthy tradition avers , however , that only one man , a person named Babbitt , survived the massacre , and he was desperately wounded .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 22]: He dragged himself on his hands and knee -LRB- for one leg was broken -RRB- to a station several miles away .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 35]: He did it during portions of two nights , lying concealed one day and part of another , and for more than forty hours suffering unimaginable anguish from hunger , thirst and bodily pain .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 17]: The Indians robbed the coach of everything it contained , including quite an amount of treasure .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 61]: We passed Fort Laramie in the night , and on the seventh morning out we found ourselves in the Black Hills , with Laramie Peak at our elbow -LRB- apparently -RRB- looming vast and solitary -- a deep , dark , rich indigo blue in hue , so portentously did the old colossus frown under his beetling brows of storm-cloud .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 26]: He was thirty or forty miles away , in reality , but he only seemed removed a little beyond the low ridge at our right .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 16]: We breakfasted at Horse-Shoe Station , six hundred and seventy-six miles out from St. Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 52]: We had now reached a hostile Indian country , and during the afternoon we passed Laparelle Station , and enjoyed great discomfort all the time we were in the neighborhood , being aware that many of the trees we dashed by at arm 's length concealed a lurking Indian or two .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 43]: During the preceding night an ambushed savage had sent a bullet through the pony-rider 's jacket , but he had ridden on , just the same , because pony-riders were not allowed to stop and inquire into such things except when killed .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 39]: As long as they had life enough left in them they had to stick to the horse and ride , even if the Indians had been waiting for them a week , and were entirely out of patience .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 56]: About two hours and a half before we arrived at Laparelle Station , the keeper in charge of it had fired four times at an Indian , but he said with an injured air that the Indian had `` skipped around so 's to spile everything -- and ammunition 's blamed skurse , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 27]: The most natural inference conveyed by his manner of speaking was , that in `` skipping around , '' the Indian had taken an unfair advantage .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 23]: The coach we were in had a neat hole through its front -- a reminiscence of its last trip through this region .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 18]: The bullet that made it wounded the driver slightly , but he did not mind it much .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 35]: He said the place to keep a man `` huffy '' was down on the Southern Overland , among the Apaches , before the company moved the stage line up on the northern route .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 51]: He said the Apaches used to annoy him all the time down there , and that he came as near as anything to starving to death in the midst of abundance , because they kept him so leaky with bullet holes that he `` could n't hold his vittles . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 9]: This person 's statement were not generally believed .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 22]: We shut the blinds down very tightly that first night in the hostile Indian country , and lay on our arms .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 17]: We slept on them some , but most of the time we only lay on them .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 12]: We did not talk much , but kept quiet and listened .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 10]: It was an inky-black night , and occasionally rainy .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 34]: We were among woods and rocks , hills and gorges -- so shut in , in fact , that when we peeped through a chink in a curtain , we could discern nothing .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 35]: The driver and conductor on top were still , too , or only spoke at long intervals , in low tones , as is the way of men in the midst of invisible dangers .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 82]: We listened to rain-drops pattering on the roof ; and the grinding of the wheels through the muddy gravel ; and the low wailing of the wind ; and all the time we had that absurd sense upon us , inseparable from travel at night in a close-curtained vehicle , the sense of remaining perfectly still in one place , notwithstanding the jolting and swaying of the vehicle , the trampling of the horses , and the grinding of the wheels .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 47]: We listened a long time , with intent faculties and bated breath ; every time one of us would relax , and draw a long sigh of relief and start to say something , a comrade would be sure to utter a sudden `` Hark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 10]: and instantly the experimenter was rigid and listening again .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 51]: So the tiresome minutes and decades of minutes dragged away , until at last our tense forms filmed over with a dulled consciousness , and we slept , if one might call such a condition by so strong a name -- for it was a sleep set with a hair-trigger .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 27]: It was a sleep seething and teeming with a weird and distressful confusion of shreds and fag-ends of dreams -- a sleep that was a chaos .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 31]: Presently , dreams and sleep and the sullen hush of the night were startled by a ringing report , and cloven by such a long , wild , agonizing shriek !
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 13]: Then we heard -- ten steps from the stage -- `` Help !
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 2]: help !
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 3]: help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 9]: -LSB- It was our driver 's voice . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 4]: `` Kill him !
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 7]: Kill him like a dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 6]: `` I 'm being murdered !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 9]: Will no man lend me a pistol ? ''
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 4]: `` Look out !
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 4]: head him off !
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 5]: head him off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 63]: -LSB- Two pistol shots ; a confusion of voices and the trampling of many feet , as if a crowd were closing and surging together around some object ; several heavy , dull blows , as with a club ; a voice that said appealingly , `` Do n't , gentlemen , please do n't -- I 'm a dead man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 27]: Then a fainter groan , and another blow , and away sped the stage into the darkness , and left the grisly mystery behind us . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 6]: What a startle it was !
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 17]: Eight seconds would amply cover the time it occupied -- maybe even five would do it .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 45]: We only had time to plunge at a curtain and unbuckle and unbutton part of it in an awkward and hindering flurry , when our whip cracked sharply overhead , and we went rumbling and thundering away , down a mountain `` grade . ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 23]: We fed on that mystery the rest of the night -- what was left of it , for it was waning fast .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 42]: It had to remain a present mystery , for all we could get from the conductor in answer to our hails was something that sounded , through the clatter of the wheels , like `` Tell you in the morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 65]: So we lit our pipes and opened the corner of a curtain for a chimney , and lay there in the dark , listening to each other 's story of how he first felt and how many thousand Indians he first thought had hurled themselves upon us , and what his remembrance of the subsequent sounds was , and the order of their occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 41]: And we theorized , too , but there was never a theory that would account for our driver 's voice being out there , nor yet account for his Indian murderers talking such good English , if they were Indians .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 31]: So we chatted and smoked the rest of the night comfortably away , our boding anxiety being somehow marvelously dissipated by the real presence of something to be anxious about .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 11]: We never did get much satisfaction about that dark occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 136]: All that we could make out of the odds and ends of the information we gathered in the morning , was that the disturbance occurred at a station ; that we changed drivers there , and that the driver that got off there had been talking roughly about some of the outlaws that infested the region -LRB- `` for there was n't a man around there but had a price on his head and did n't dare show himself in the settlements , '' the conductor said -RRB- ; he had talked roughly about these characters , and ought to have `` drove up there with his pistol cocked and ready on the seat alongside of him , and begun business himself , because any softy would know they would be laying for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 26]: That was all we could gather , and we could see that neither the conductor nor the new driver were much concerned about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 50]: They plainly had little respect for a man who would deliver offensive opinions of people and then be so simple as to come into their presence unprepared to `` back his judgment , '' as they pleasantly phrased the killing of any fellow-being who did not like said opinions .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 50]: And likewise they plainly had a contempt for the man 's poor discretion in venturing to rouse the wrath of such utterly reckless wild beasts as those outlaws -- and the conductor added : `` I tell you it 's as much as Slade himself want to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 10]: This remark created an entire revolution in my curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 17]: I cared nothing now about the Indians , and even lost interest in the murdered driver .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 10]: There was such magic in that name , SLADE !
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 29]: Day or night , now , I stood always ready to drop any subject in hand , to listen to something new about Slade and his ghastly exploits .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 68]: Even before we got to Overland City , we had begun to hear about Slade and his `` division '' -LRB- for he was a `` division-agent '' -RRB- on the Overland ; and from the hour we had left Overland City we had heard drivers and conductors talk about only three things -- `` Californy , '' the Nevada silver mines , and this desperado Slade .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 12]: And a deal the most of the talk was about Slade .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 123]: We had gradually come to have a realizing sense of the fact that Slade was a man whose heart and hands and soul were steeped in the blood of offenders against his dignity ; a man who awfully avenged all injuries , affront , insults or slights , of whatever kind -- on the spot if he could , years afterward if lack of earlier opportunity compelled it ; a man whose hate tortured him day and night till vengeance appeased it -- and not an ordinary vengeance either , but his enemy 's absolute death -- nothing less ; a man whose face would light up with a terrible joy when he surprised a foe and had him at a disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 44]: A high and efficient servant of the Overland , an outlaw among outlaws and yet their relentless scourge , Slade was at once the most bloody , the most dangerous and the most valuable citizen that inhabited the savage fastnesses of the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 31]: CHAPTER X. Really and truly , two thirds of the talk of drivers and conductors had been about this man Slade , ever since the day before we reached Julesburg .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 58]: In order that the eastern reader may have a clear conception of what a Rocky Mountain desperado is , in his highest state of development , I will reduce all this mass of overland gossip to one straightforward narrative , and present it in the following shape : Slade was born in Illinois , of good parentage .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 18]: At about twenty-six years of age he killed a man in a quarrel and fled the country .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 24]: At St. Joseph , Missouri , he joined one of the early California-bound emigrant trains , and was given the post of train-master .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 22]: One day on the plains he had an angry dispute with one of his wagon-drivers , and both drew their revolvers .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 15]: But the driver was the quicker artist , and had his weapon cocked first .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 34]: So Slade said it was a pity to waste life on so small a matter , and proposed that the pistols be thrown on the ground and the quarrel settled by a fist-fight .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 23]: The unsuspecting driver agreed , and threw down his pistol -- whereupon Slade laughed at his simplicity , and shot him dead !
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 37]: He made his escape , and lived a wild life for awhile , dividing his time between fighting Indians and avoiding an Illinois sheriff , who had been sent to arrest him for his first murder .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 38]: It is said that in one Indian battle he killed three savages with his own hand , and afterward cut their ears off and sent them , with his compliments , to the chief of the tribe .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 35]: Slade soon gained a name for fearless resolution , and this was sufficient merit to procure for him the important post of overland division-agent at Julesburg , in place of Mr. Jules , removed .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 44]: For some time previously , the company 's horses had been frequently stolen , and the coaches delayed , by gangs of outlaws , who were wont to laugh at the idea of any man 's having the temerity to resent such outrages .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 5]: Slade resented them promptly .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 23]: The outlaws soon found that the new agent was a man who did not fear anything that breathed the breath of life .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 8]: He made short work of all offenders .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 33]: The result was that delays ceased , the company 's property was let alone , and no matter what happened or who suffered , Slade 's coaches went through , every time !
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 40]: True , in order to bring about this wholesome change , Slade had to kill several men -- some say three , others say four , and others six -- but the world was the richer for their loss .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 25]: The first prominent difficulty he had was with the ex-agent Jules , who bore the reputation of being a reckless and desperate man himself .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 22]: Jules hated Slade for supplanting him , and a good fair occasion for a fight was all he was waiting for .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 15]: By and by Slade dared to employ a man whom Jules had once discharged .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 24]: Next , Slade seized a team of stage-horses which he accused Jules of having driven off and hidden somewhere for his own use .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 38]: War was declared , and for a day or two the two men walked warily about the streets , seeking each other , Jules armed with a double-barreled shot gun , and Slade with his history-creating revolver .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 22]: Finally , as Slade stepped into a store Jules poured the contents of his gun into him from behind the door .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 14]: Slade was plucky , and Jules got several bad pistol wounds in return .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 25]: Then both men fell , and were carried to their respective lodgings , both swearing that better aim should do deadlier work next time .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 46]: Both were bedridden a long time , but Jules got to his feet first , and gathering his possessions together , packed them on a couple of mules , and fled to the Rocky Mountains to gather strength in safety against the day of reckoning .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 25]: For many months he was not seen or heard of , and was gradually dropped out of the remembrance of all save Slade himself .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 10]: But Slade was not the man to forget him .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 21]: On the contrary , common report said that Slade kept a reward standing for his capture , dead or alive !
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 51]: After awhile , seeing that Slade 's energetic administration had restored peace and order to one of the worst divisions of the road , the overland stage company transferred him to the Rocky Ridge division in the Rocky Mountains , to see if he could perform a like miracle there .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 10]: It was the very paradise of outlaws and desperadoes .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 9]: There was absolutely no semblance of law there .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 5]: Violence was the rule .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 7]: Force was the only recognized authority .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 15]: The commonest misunderstandings were settled on the spot with the revolver or the knife .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 20]: Murders were done in open day , and with sparkling frequency , and nobody thought of inquiring into them .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 30]: It was considered that the parties who did the killing had their private reasons for it ; for other people to meddle would have been looked upon as indelicate .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 51]: After a murder , all that Rocky Mountain etiquette required of a spectator was , that he should help the gentleman bury his game -- otherwise his churlishness would surely be remembered against him the first time he killed a man himself and needed a neighborly turn in interring him .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 39]: Slade took up his residence sweetly and peacefully in the midst of this hive of horse-thieves and assassins , and the very first time one of them aired his insolent swaggerings in his presence he shot him dead !
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 68]: He began a raid on the outlaws , and in a singularly short space of time he had completely stopped their depredations on the stage stock , recovered a large number of stolen horses , killed several of the worst desperadoes of the district , and gained such a dread ascendancy over the rest that they respected him , admired him , feared him , obeyed him !
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 21]: He wrought the same marvelous change in the ways of the community that had marked his administration at Overland City .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 19]: He captured two men who had stolen overland stock , and with his own hands he hanged them .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 35]: He was supreme judge in his district , and he was jury and executioner likewise -- and not only in the case of offences against his employers , but against passing emigrants as well .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 23]: On one occasion some emigrants had their stock lost or stolen , and told Slade , who chanced to visit their camp .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 33]: With a single companion he rode to a ranch , the owners of which he suspected , and opening the door , commenced firing , killing three , and wounding the fourth .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 8]: From a bloodthirstily interesting little Montana book .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 13]: -- -LSB- `` The Vigilantes of Montana , '' by Prof. Thos .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 4]: J. Dimsdale . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 17]: -- I take this paragraph : `` While on the road , Slade held absolute sway .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 27]: He would ride down to a station , get into a quarrel , turn the house out of windows , and maltreat the occupants most cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 19]: The unfortunates had no means of redress , and were compelled to recuperate as best they could . ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 35]: On one of these occasions , it is said he killed the father of the fine little half-breed boy Jemmy , whom he adopted , and who lived with his widow after his execution .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 36]: Stories of Slade 's hanging men , and of innumerable assaults , shootings , stabbings and beatings , in which he was a principal actor , form part of the legends of the stage line .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 28]: As for minor quarrels and shootings , it is absolutely certain that a minute history of Slade 's life would be one long record of such practices .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 10]: Slade was a matchless marksman with a navy revolver .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 70]: The legends say that one morning at Rocky Ridge , when he was feeling comfortable , he saw a man approaching who had offended him some days before -- observe the fine memory he had for matters like that -- and , `` Gentlemen , '' said Slade , drawing , `` it is a good twenty-yard shot -- I 'll clip the third button on his coat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 4]: Which he did .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 6]: The bystanders all admired it .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 9]: And they all attended the funeral , too .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 26]: On one occasion a man who kept a little whisky-shelf at the station did something which angered Slade -- and went and made his will .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 14]: A day or two afterward Slade came in and called for some brandy .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 57]: The man reached under the counter -LRB- ostensibly to get a bottle -- possibly to get something else -RRB- , but Slade smiled upon him that peculiarly bland and satisfied smile of his which the neighbors had long ago learned to recognize as a death-warrant in disguise , and told him to `` none of that !
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 8]: -- pass out the high-priced article . ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 35]: So the poor bar-keeper had to turn his back and get the high-priced brandy from the shelf ; and when he faced around again he was looking into the muzzle of Slade 's pistol .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 26]: `` And the next instant , '' added my informant , impressively , `` he was one of the deadest men that ever lived . ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 35]: The stage-drivers and conductors told us that sometimes Slade would leave a hated enemy wholly unmolested , unnoticed and unmentioned , for weeks together -- had done it once or twice at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 65]: And some said they believed he did it in order to lull the victims into unwatchfulness , so that he could get the advantage of them , and others said they believed he saved up an enemy that way , just as a schoolboy saves up a cake , and made the pleasure go as far as it would by gloating over the anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 14]: One of these cases was that of a Frenchman who had offended Slade .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 23]: To the surprise of everybody Slade did not kill him on the spot , but let him alone for a considerable time .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 58]: Finally , however , he went to the Frenchman 's house very late one night , knocked , and when his enemy opened the door , shot him dead -- pushed the corpse inside the door with his foot , set the house on fire and burned up the dead man , his widow and three children !
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 18]: I heard this story from several different people , and they evidently believed what they were saying .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 10]: It may be true , and it may not .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 11]: `` Give a dog a bad name , '' etc. .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 17]: Slade was captured , once , by a party of men who intended to lynch him .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 20]: They disarmed him , and shut him up in a strong log-house , and placed a guard over him .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 22]: He prevailed on his captors to send for his wife , so that he might have a last interview with her .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 10]: She was a brave , loving , spirited woman .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 12]: She jumped on a horse and rode for life and death .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 37]: When she arrived they let her in without searching her , and before the door could be closed she whipped out a couple of revolvers , and she and her lord marched forth defying the party .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 16]: And then , under a brisk fire , they mounted double and galloped away unharmed !
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 37]: In the fulness of time Slade 's myrmidons captured his ancient enemy Jules , whom they found in a well-chosen hiding-place in the remote fastnesses of the mountains , gaining a precarious livelihood with his rifle .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 28]: They brought him to Rocky Ridge , bound hand and foot , and deposited him in the middle of the cattle-yard with his back against a post .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 22]: It is said that the pleasure that lit Slade 's face when he heard of it was something fearful to contemplate .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 31]: He examined his enemy to see that he was securely tied , and then went to bed , content to wait till morning before enjoying the luxury of killing him .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 20]: Jules spent the night in the cattle-yard , and it is a region where warm nights are never known .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 41]: In the morning Slade practised on him with his revolver , nipping the flesh here and there , and occasionally clipping off a finger , while Jules begged him to kill him outright and put him out of his misery .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 21]: Finally Slade reloaded , and walking up close to his victim , made some characteristic remarks and then dispatched him .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 29]: The body lay there half a day , nobody venturing to touch it without orders , and then Slade detailed a party and assisted at the burial himself .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 29]: But he first cut off the dead man 's ears and put them in his vest pocket , where he carried them for some time with great satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 20]: That is the story as I have frequently heard it told and seen it in print in California newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 9]: It is doubtless correct in all essential particulars .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 32]: In due time we rattled up to a stage-station , and sat down to breakfast with a half-savage , half-civilized company of armed and bearded mountaineers , ranchmen and station employees .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 37]: The most gentlemanly-appearing , quiet and affable officer we had yet found along the road in the Overland Company 's service was the person who sat at the head of the table , at my elbow .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 16]: Never youth stared and shivered as I did when I heard them call him SLADE !
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 13]: Here was romance , and I sitting face to face with it !
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 16]: -- looking upon it -- touching it -- hobnobbing with it , as it were !
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 37]: Here , right by my side , was the actual ogre who , in fights and brawls and various ways , had taken the lives of twenty-six human beings , or all men lied about him !
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 18]: I suppose I was the proudest stripling that ever traveled to see strange lands and wonderful people .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 19]: He was so friendly and so gentle-spoken that I warmed to him in spite of his awful history .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 31]: It was hardly possible to realize that this pleasant person was the pitiless scourge of the outlaws , the raw-head-and-bloody-bones the nursing mothers of the mountains terrified their children with .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 38]: And to this day I can remember nothing remarkable about Slade except that his face was rather broad across the cheek bones , and that the cheek bones were low and the lips peculiarly thin and straight .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 36]: But that was enough to leave something of an effect upon me , for since then I seldom see a face possessing those characteristics without fancying that the owner of it is a dangerous man .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 5]: The coffee ran out .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 25]: At least it was reduced to one tin-cupful , and Slade was about to take it when he saw that my cup was empty .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 17]: He politely offered to fill it , but although I wanted it , I politely declined .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 17]: I was afraid he had not killed anybody that morning , and might be needing diversion .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 41]: But still with firm politeness he insisted on filling my cup , and said I had traveled all night and better deserved it than he -- and while he talked he placidly poured the fluid , to the last drop .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 49]: I thanked him and drank it , but it gave me no comfort , for I could not feel sure that he would not be sorry , presently , that he had given it away , and proceed to kill me to distract his thoughts from the loss .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 7]: But nothing of the kind occurred .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 41]: We left him with only twenty-six dead people to account for , and I felt a tranquil satisfaction in the thought that in so judiciously taking care of No. 1 at that breakfast-table I had pleasantly escaped being No. 27 .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 48]: Slade came out to the coach and saw us off , first ordering certain rearrangements of the mail-bags for our comfort , and then we took leave of him , satisfied that we should hear of him again , some day , and wondering in what connection .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 16]: And sure enough , two or three years afterward , we did hear him again .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 25]: News came to the Pacific coast that the Vigilance Committee in Montana -LRB- whither Slade had removed from Rocky Ridge -RRB- had hanged him .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 52]: I find an account of the affair in the thrilling little book I quoted a paragraph from in the last chapter -- `` The Vigilantes of Montana ; being a Reliable Account of the Capture , Trial and Execution of Henry Plummer 's Notorious Road Agent Band : By Prof. Thos .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 38]: J. Dimsdale , Virginia City , M.T. '' Mr. Dimsdale 's chapter is well worth reading , as a specimen of how the people of the frontier deal with criminals when the courts of law prove inefficient .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 81]: Mr. Dimsdale makes two remarks about Slade , both of which are accurately descriptive , and one of which is exceedingly picturesque : `` Those who saw him in his natural state only , would pronounce him to be a kind husband , a most hospitable host and a courteous gentleman ; on the contrary , those who met him when maddened with liquor and surrounded by a gang of armed roughs , would pronounce him a fiend incarnate . ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 22]: And this : `` From Fort Kearney , west , he was feared a great deal more than the almighty . ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 21]: For compactness , simplicity and vigor of expression , I will `` back '' that sentence against anything in literature .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 8]: Mr. Dimsdale 's narrative is as follows .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 34]: In all places where italics occur , they are mine : After the execution of the five men on the 14th of January , the Vigilantes considered that their work was nearly ended .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 44]: They had freed the country of highwaymen and murderers to a great extent , and they determined that in the absence of the regular civil authority they would establish a People 's Court where all offenders should be tried by judge and jury .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 39]: This was the nearest approach to social order that the circumstances permitted , and , though strict legal authority was wanting , yet the people were firmly determined to maintain its efficiency , and to enforce its decrees .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 64]: It may here be mentioned that the overt act which was the last round on the fatal ladder leading to the scaffold on which Slade perished , was the tearing in pieces and stamping upon a writ of this court , followed by his arrest of the Judge Alex. Davis , by authority of a presented Derringer , and with his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 29]: J. A. Slade was himself , we have been informed , a Vigilante ; he openly boasted of it , and said he knew all that they knew .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 76]: He was never accused , or even suspected , of either murder or robbery , committed in this Territory -LRB- the latter crime was never laid to his charge , in any place -RRB- ; but that he had killed several men in other localities was notorious , and his bad reputation in this respect was a most powerful argument in determining his fate , when he was finally arrested for the offence above mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 34]: On returning from Milk River he became more and more addicted to drinking , until at last it was a common feat for him and his friends to `` take the town . ''
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 29]: He and a couple of his dependents might often be seen on one horse , galloping through the streets , shouting and yelling , firing revolvers , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 30]: On many occasions he would ride his horse into stores , break up bars , toss the scales out of doors and use most insulting language to parties present .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 47]: Just previous to the day of his arrest , he had given a fearful beating to one of his followers ; but such was his influence over them that the man wept bitterly at the gallows , and begged for his life with all his power .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 38]: It had become quite common , when Slade was on a spree , for the shop-keepers and citizens to close the stores and put out all the lights ; being fearful of some outrage at his hands .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 48]: For his wanton destruction of goods and furniture , he was always ready to pay , when sober , if he had money ; but there were not a few who regarded payment as small satisfaction for the outrage , and these men were his personal enemies .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 26]: From time to time Slade received warnings from men that he well knew would not deceive him , of the certain end of his conduct .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 27]: There was not a moment , for weeks previous to his arrest , in which the public did not expect to hear of some bloody outrage .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 39]: The dread of his very name , and the presence of the armed band of hangers-on who followed him alone prevented a resistance which must certainly have ended in the instant murder or mutilation of the opposing party .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 72]: Slade was frequently arrested by order of the court whose organization we have described , and had treated it with respect by paying one or two fines and promising to pay the rest when he had money ; but in the transaction that occurred at this crisis , he forgot even this caution , and goaded by passion and the hatred of restraint , he sprang into the embrace of death .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 12]: Slade had been drunk and `` cutting up '' all night .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 12]: He and his companions had made the town a perfect hell .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 38]: In the morning , J. M. Fox , the sheriff , met him , arrested him , took him into court and commenced reading a warrant that he had for his arrest , by way of arraignment .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 25]: He became uncontrollably furious , and seizing the writ , he tore it up , threw it on the ground and stamped upon it .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 20]: The clicking of the locks of his companions ' revolvers was instantly heard , and a crisis was expected .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 42]: The sheriff did not attempt his retention ; but being at least as prudent as he was valiant , he succumbed , leaving Slade the master of the situation and the conqueror and ruler of the courts , law and law-makers .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 12]: This was a declaration of war , and was so accepted .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 26]: The Vigilance Committee now felt that the question of social order and the preponderance of the law-abiding citizens had then and there to be decided .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 94]: They knew the character of Slade , and they were well aware that they must submit to his rule without murmur , or else that he must be dealt with in such fashion as would prevent his being able to wreak his vengeance on the committee , who could never have hoped to live in the Territory secure from outrage or death , and who could never leave it without encountering his friend , whom his victory would have emboldened and stimulated to a pitch that would have rendered them reckless of consequences .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 33]: The day previous he had ridden into Dorris 's store , and on being requested to leave , he drew his revolver and threatened to kill the gentleman who spoke to him .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 25]: Another saloon he had led his horse into , and buying a bottle of wine , he tried to make the animal drink it .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 26]: This was not considered an uncommon performance , as he had often entered saloons and commenced firing at the lamps , causing a wild stampede .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 52]: A leading member of the committee met Slade , and informed him in the quiet , earnest manner of one who feels the importance of what he is saying : `` Slade , get your horse at once , and go home , or there will be -- to pay . ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 19]: Slade started and took a long look , with his dark and piercing eyes , at the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 33]: `` You have no right to ask me what I mean , '' was the quiet reply , `` get your horse at once , and remember what I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 91]: After a short pause he promised to do so , and actually got into the saddle ; but , being still intoxicated , he began calling aloud to one after another of his friends , and at last seemed to have forgotten the warning he had received and became again uproarious , shouting the name of a well-known courtezan in company with those of two men whom he considered heads of the committee , as a sort of challenge ; perhaps , however , as a simple act of bravado .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 35]: It seems probable that the intimation of personal danger he had received had not been forgotten entirely ; though fatally for him , he took a foolish way of showing his remembrance of it .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 41]: He sought out Alexander Davis , the Judge of the Court , and drawing a cocked Derringer , he presented it at his head , and told him that he should hold him as a hostage for his own safety .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 23]: As the judge stood perfectly quiet , and offered no resistance to his captor , no further outrage followed on this score .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 26]: Previous to this , on account of the critical state of affairs , the committee had met , and at last resolved to arrest him .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 22]: His execution had not been agreed upon , and , at that time , would have been negatived , most assuredly .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 39]: A messenger rode down to Nevada to inform the leading men of what was on hand , as it was desirable to show that there was a feeling of unanimity on the subject , all along the gulch .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 32]: The miners turned out almost en masse , leaving their work and forming in solid column about six hundred strong , armed to the teeth , they marched up to Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 16]: The leader of the body well knew the temper of his men on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 62]: He spurred on ahead of them , and hastily calling a meeting of the executive , he told them plainly that the miners meant `` business , '' and that , if they came up , they would not stand in the street to be shot down by Slade 's friends ; but that they would take him and hang him .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 16]: The meeting was small , as the Virginia men were loath to act at all .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 35]: This momentous announcement of the feeling of the Lower Town was made to a cluster of men , who were deliberation behind a wagon , at the rear of a store on Main street .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 10]: The committee were most unwilling to proceed to extremities .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 26]: All the duty they had ever performed seemed as nothing to the task before them ; but they had to decide , and that quickly .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 35]: It was finally agreed that if the whole body of the miners were of the opinion that he should be hanged , that the committee left it in their hands to deal with him .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 18]: Off , at hot speed , rode the leader of the Nevada men to join his command .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 15]: Slade had found out what was intended , and the news sobered him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 28]: He went into P. S. Pfouts ' store , where Davis was , and apologized for his conduct , saying that he would take it all back .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 17]: The head of the column now wheeled into Wallace street and marched up at quick time .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 42]: Halting in front of the store , the executive officer of the committee stepped forward and arrested Slade , who was at once informed of his doom , and inquiry was made as to whether he had any business to settle .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 33]: Several parties spoke to him on the subject ; but to all such inquiries he turned a deaf ear , being entirely absorbed in the terrifying reflections on his own awful position .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 15]: He never ceased his entreaties for life , and to see his dear wife .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 28]: The unfortunate lady referred to , between whom and Slade there existed a warm affection , was at this time living at their ranch on the Madison .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 28]: She was possessed of considerable personal attractions ; tall , well-formed , of graceful carriage , pleasing manners , and was , withal , an accomplished horsewoman .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 17]: A messenger from Slade rode at full speed to inform her of her husband 's arrest .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 55]: In an instant she was in the saddle , and with all the energy that love and despair could lend to an ardent temperament and a strong physique , she urged her fleet charger over the twelve miles of rough and rocky ground that intervened between her and the object of her passionate devotion .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 22]: Meanwhile a party of volunteers had made the necessary preparations for the execution , in the valley traversed by the branch .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 24]: Beneath the site of Pfouts and Russell 's stone building there was a corral , the gate-posts of which were strong and high .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 24]: Across the top was laid a beam , to which the rope was fastened , and a dry-goods box served for the platform .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 28]: To this place Slade was marched , surrounded by a guard , composing the best armed and most numerous force that has ever appeared in Montana Territory .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 27]: The doomed man had so exhausted himself by tears , prayers and lamentations , that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the fatal beam .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 8]: He repeatedly exclaimed , `` My God !
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 3]: my God !
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 4]: must I die ?
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 7]: Oh , my dear wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 34]: On the return of the fatigue party , they encountered some friends of Slade , staunch and reliable citizens and members of the committee , but who were personally attached to the condemned .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 27]: On hearing of his sentence , one of them , a stout-hearted man , pulled out his handkerchief and walked away , weeping like a child .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 53]: Slade still begged to see his wife , most piteously , and it seemed hard to deny his request ; but the bloody consequences that were sure to follow the inevitable attempt at a rescue , that her presence and entreaties would have certainly incited , forbade the granting of his request .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 48]: Several gentlemen were sent for to see him , in his last moments , one of whom -LRB- Judge Davis -RRB- made a short address to the people ; but in such low tones as to be inaudible , save to a few in his immediate vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 31]: One of his friends , after exhausting his powers of entreaty , threw off his coat and declared that the prisoner could not be hanged until he himself was killed .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 39]: A hundred guns were instantly leveled at him ; whereupon he turned and fled ; but , being brought back , he was compelled to resume his coat , and to give a promise of future peaceable demeanor .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 27]: Scarcely a leading man in Virginia could be found , though numbers of the citizens joined the ranks of the guard when the arrest was made .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 10]: All lamented the stern necessity which dictated the execution .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 33]: Everything being ready , the command was given , `` Men , do your duty , '' and the box being instantly slipped from beneath his feet , he died almost instantaneously .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 54]: The body was cut down and carried to the Virginia Hotel , where , in a darkened room , it was scarcely laid out , when the unfortunate and bereaved companion of the deceased arrived , at headlong speed , to find that all was over , and that she was a widow .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 35]: Her grief and heart-piercing cries were terrible evidences of the depth of her attachment for her lost husband , and a considerable period elapsed before she could regain the command of her excited feelings .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 17]: There is something about the desperado-nature that is wholly unaccountable -- at least it looks unaccountable .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 4]: It is this .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 62]: The true desperado is gifted with splendid courage , and yet he will take the most infamous advantage of his enemy ; armed and free , he will stand up before a host and fight until he is shot all to pieces , and yet when he is under the gallows and helpless he will cry and plead like a child .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 116]: Words are cheap , and it is easy to call Slade a coward -LRB- all executed men who do not `` die game '' are promptly called cowards by unreflecting people -RRB- , and when we read of Slade that he `` had so exhausted himself by tears , prayers and lamentations , that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the fatal beam , '' the disgraceful word suggests itself in a moment -- yet in frequently defying and inviting the vengeance of banded Rocky Mountain cut-throats by shooting down their comrades and leaders , and never offering to hide or fly , Slade showed that he was a man of peerless bravery .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 6]: No coward would dare that .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 70]: Many a notorious coward , many a chicken-livered poltroon , coarse , brutal , degraded , has made his dying speech without a quaver in his voice and been swung into eternity with what looked liked the calmest fortitude , and so we are justified in believing , from the low intellect of such a creature , that it was not moral courage that enabled him to do it .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 22]: Then , if moral courage is not the requisite quality , what could it have been that this stout-hearted Slade lacked ?
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 34]: -- this bloody , desperate , kindly-mannered , urbane gentleman , who never hesitated to warn his most ruffianly enemies that he would kill them whenever or wherever he came across them next !
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 9]: I think it is a conundrum worth investigating .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 80]: Just beyond the breakfast-station we overtook a Mormon emigrant train of thirty-three wagons ; and tramping wearily along and driving their herd of loose cows , were dozens of coarse-clad and sad-looking men , women and children , who had walked as they were walking now , day after day for eight lingering weeks , and in that time had compassed the distance our stage had come in eight days and three hours -- seven hundred and ninety-eight miles !
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 19]: They were dusty and uncombed , hatless , bonnetless and ragged , and they did look so tired !
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 41]: After breakfast , we bathed in Horse Creek , a -LRB- previously -RRB- limpid , sparkling stream -- an appreciated luxury , for it was very seldom that our furious coach halted long enough for an indulgence of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 30]: We changed horses ten or twelve times in every twenty-four hours -- changed mules , rather -- six mules -- and did it nearly every time in four minutes .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 5]: It was lively work .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 45]: As our coach rattled up to each station six harnessed mules stepped gayly from the stable ; and in the twinkling of an eye , almost , the old team was out , and the new one in and we off and away again .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 20]: During the afternoon we passed Sweetwater Creek , Independence Rock , Devil 's Gate and the Devil 's Gap .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 26]: The latter were wild specimens of rugged scenery , and full of interest -- we were in the heart of the Rocky Mountains , now .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 52]: And we also passed by `` Alkali '' or `` Soda Lake , '' and we woke up to the fact that our journey had stretched a long way across the world when the driver said that the Mormons often came there from Great Salt Lake City to haul away saleratus .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 60]: He said that a few days gone by they had shoveled up enough pure saleratus from the ground -LRB- it was a dry lake -RRB- to load two wagons , and that when they got these two wagons-loads of a drug that cost them nothing , to Salt Lake , they could sell it for twenty-five cents a pound .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 33]: In the night we sailed by a most notable curiosity , and one we had been hearing a good deal about for a day or two , and were suffering to see .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 10]: This was what might be called a natural ice-house .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 61]: It was August , now , and sweltering weather in the daytime , yet at one of the stations the men could scape the soil on the hill-side under the lee of a range of boulders , and at a depth of six inches cut out pure blocks of ice -- hard , compactly frozen , and clear as crystal !
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 76]: Toward dawn we got under way again , and presently as we sat with raised curtains enjoying our early-morning smoke and contemplating the first splendor of the rising sun as it swept down the long array of mountain peaks , flushing and gilding crag after crag and summit after summit , as if the invisible Creator reviewed his gray veterans and they saluted with a smile , we hove in sight of South Pass City .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 41]: The hotel-keeper , the postmaster , the blacksmith , the mayor , the constable , the city marshal and the principal citizen and property holder , all came out and greeted us cheerily , and we gave him good day .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 25]: He gave us a little Indian news , and a little Rocky Mountain news , and we gave him some Plains information in return .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 21]: He then retired to his lonely grandeur and we climbed on up among the bristling peaks and the ragged clouds .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 35]: South Pass City consisted of four log cabins , one if which was unfinished , and the gentleman with all those offices and titles was the chiefest of the ten citizens of the place .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 28]: Think of hotel-keeper , postmaster , blacksmith , mayor , constable , city marshal and principal citizen all condensed into one person and crammed into one skin .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 14]: Bemis said he was `` a perfect Allen 's revolver of dignities . ''
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 48]: And he said that if he were to die as postmaster , or as blacksmith , or as postmaster and blacksmith both , the people might stand it ; but if he were to die all over , it would be a frightful loss to the community .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 54]: Two miles beyond South Pass City we saw for the first time that mysterious marvel which all Western untraveled boys have heard of and fully believe in , but are sure to be astounded at when they see it with their own eyes , nevertheless -- banks of snow in dead summer time .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 97]: We were now far up toward the sky , and knew all the time that we must presently encounter lofty summits clad in the `` eternal snow '' which was so common place a matter of mention in books , and yet when I did see it glittering in the sun on stately domes in the distance and knew the month was August and that my coat was hanging up because it was too warm to wear it , I was full as much amazed as if I never had heard of snow in August before .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 62]: Truly , `` seeing is believing '' -- and many a man lives a long life through , thinking he believes certain universally received and well established things , and yet never suspects that if he were confronted by those things once , he would discover that he did not really believe them before , but only thought he believed them .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 63]: In a little while quite a number of peaks swung into view with long claws of glittering snow clasping them ; and with here and there , in the shade , down the mountain side , a little solitary patch of snow looking no larger than a lady 's pocket-handkerchief but being in reality as large as a `` public square . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 25]: And now , at last , we were fairly in the renowned SOUTH PASS , and whirling gayly along high above the common world .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 76]: We were perched upon the extreme summit of the great range of the Rocky Mountains , toward which we had been climbing , patiently climbing , ceaselessly climbing , for days and nights together -- and about us was gathered a convention of Nature 's kings that stood ten , twelve , and even thirteen thousand feet high -- grand old fellows who would have to stoop to see Mount Washington , in the twilight .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 64]: We were in such an airy elevation above the creeping populations of the earth , that now and then when the obstructing crags stood out of the way it seemed that we could look around and abroad and contemplate the whole great globe , with its dissolving views of mountains , seas and continents stretching away through the mystery of the summer haze .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 30]: As a general thing the Pass was more suggestive of a valley than a suspension bridge in the clouds -- but it strongly suggested the latter at one spot .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 57]: At that place the upper third of one or two majestic purple domes projected above our level on either hand and gave us a sense of a hidden great deep of mountains and plains and valleys down about their bases which we fancied we might see if we could step to the edge and look over .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 75]: These Sultans of the fastnesses were turbaned with tumbled volumes of cloud , which shredded away from time to time and drifted off fringed and torn , trailing their continents of shadow after them ; and catching presently on an intercepting peak , wrapped it about and brooded there -- then shredded away again and left the purple peak , as they had left the purple domes , downy and white with new-laid snow .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 39]: In passing , these monstrous rags of cloud hung low and swept along right over the spectator 's head , swinging their tatters so nearly in his face that his impulse was to shrink when they came closet .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 137]: In the one place I speak of , one could look below him upon a world of diminishing crags and canyons leading down , down , and away to a vague plain with a thread in it which was a road , and bunches of feathers in it which were trees , -- a pretty picture sleeping in the sunlight -- but with a darkness stealing over it and glooming its features deeper and deeper under the frown of a coming storm ; and then , while no film or shadow marred the noon brightness of his high perch , he could watch the tempest break forth down there and see the lightnings leap from crag to crag and the sheeted rain drive along the canyon-sides , and hear the thunders peal and crash and roar .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 17]: We had this spectacle ; a familiar one to many , but to us a novelty .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 54]: We bowled along cheerily , and presently , at the very summit -LRB- though it had been all summit to us , and all equally level , for half an hour or more -RRB- , we came to a spring which spent its water through two outlets and sent it in opposite directions .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 42]: The conductor said that one of those streams which we were looking at , was just starting on a journey westward to the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean , through hundreds and even thousands of miles of desert solitudes .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 224]: He said that the other was just leaving its home among the snow-peaks on a similar journey eastward -- and we knew that long after we should have forgotten the simple rivulet it would still be plodding its patient way down the mountain sides , and canyon-beds , and between the banks of the Yellowstone ; and by and by would join the broad Missouri and flow through unknown plains and deserts and unvisited wildernesses ; and add a long and troubled pilgrimage among snags and wrecks and sandbars ; and enter the Mississippi , touch the wharves of St. Louis and still drift on , traversing shoals and rocky channels , then endless chains of bottomless and ample bends , walled with unbroken forests , then mysterious byways and secret passages among woody islands , then the chained bends again , bordered with wide levels of shining sugar-cane in place of the sombre forests ; then by New Orleans and still other chains of bends -- and finally , after two long months of daily and nightly harassment , excitement , enjoyment , adventure , and awful peril of parched throats , pumps and evaporation , pass the Gulf and enter into its rest upon the bosom of the tropic sea , never to look upon its snow-peaks again or regret them .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 21]: I freighted a leaf with a mental message for the friends at home , and dropped it in the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 15]: But I put no stamp on it and it was held for postage somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 26]: On the summit we overtook an emigrant train of many wagons , many tired men and women , and many a disgusted sheep and cow .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 15]: In the wofully dusty horseman in charge of the expedition I recognized John ----- .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 31]: Of all persons in the world to meet on top of the Rocky Mountains thousands of miles from home , he was the last one I should have looked for .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 10]: We were school-boys together and warm friends for years .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 17]: But a boyish prank of mine had disruptured this friendship and it had never been renewed .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 9]: The act of which I speak was this .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 24]: I had been accustomed to visit occasionally an editor whose room was in the third story of a building and overlooked the street .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 54]: One day this editor gave me a watermelon which I made preparations to devour on the spot , but chancing to look out of the window , I saw John standing directly under it and an irresistible desire came upon me to drop the melon on his head , which I immediately did .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 32]: I was the loser , for it spoiled the melon , and John never forgave me and we dropped all intercourse and parted , but now met again under these circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 30]: We recognized each other simultaneously , and hands were grasped as warmly as if no coldness had ever existed between us , and no allusion was made to any .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 52]: All animosities were buried and the simple fact of meeting a familiar face in that isolated spot so far from home , was sufficient to make us forget all things but pleasant ones , and we parted again with sincere `` good-bye '' and `` God bless you '' from both .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 24]: We had been climbing up the long shoulders of the Rocky Mountains for many tedious hours -- we started down them , now .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 11]: And we went spinning away at a round rate too .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 66]: We left the snowy Wind River Mountains and Uinta Mountains behind , and sped away , always through splendid scenery but occasionally through long ranks of white skeletons of mules and oxen -- monuments of the huge emigration of other days -- and here and there were up-ended boards or small piles of stones which the driver said marked the resting-place of more precious remains .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 9]: It was the loneliest land for a grave !
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 22]: A land given over to the cayote and the raven -- which is but another name for desolation and utter solitude .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 28]: On damp , murky nights , these scattered skeletons gave forth a soft , hideous glow , like very faint spots of moonlight starring the vague desert .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 10]: It was because of the phosphorus in the bones .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 27]: But no scientific explanation could keep a body from shivering when he drifted by one of those ghostly lights and knew that a skull held it .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 30]: At midnight it began to rain , and I never saw anything like it -- indeed , I did not even see this , for it was too dark .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 23]: We fastened down the curtains and even caulked them with clothing , but the rain streamed in in twenty places , nothwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 5]: There was no escape .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 29]: If one moved his feet out of a stream , he brought his body under one ; and if he moved his body he caught one somewhere else .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 25]: If he struggled out of the drenched blankets and sat up , he was bound to get one down the back of his neck .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 45]: Meantime the stage was wandering about a plain with gaping gullies in it , for the driver could not see an inch before his face nor keep the road , and the storm pelted so pitilessly that there was no keeping the horses still .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 38]: With the first abatement the conductor turned out with lanterns to look for the road , and the first dash he made was into a chasm about fourteen feet deep , his lantern following like a meteor .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 18]: As soon as he touched bottom he sang out frantically : `` Do n't come here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 32]: To which the driver , who was looking over the precipice where he had disappeared , replied , with an injured air : `` Think I 'm a dam fool ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 29]: The conductor was more than an hour finding the road -- a matter which showed us how far we had wandered and what chances we had been taking .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 15]: He traced our wheel-tracks to the imminent verge of danger , in two places .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 13]: I have always been glad that we were not killed that night .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 15]: I do not know any particular reason , but I have always been glad .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 53]: In the morning , the tenth day out , we crossed Green River , a fine , large , limpid stream -- stuck in it with the water just up to the top of our mail-bed , and waited till extra teams were put on to haul us up the steep bank .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 21]: But it was nice cool water , and besides it could not find any fresh place on us to wet .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 46]: At the Green River station we had breakfast -- hot biscuits , fresh antelope steaks , and coffee -- the only decent meal we tasted between the United States and Great Salt Lake City , and the only one we were ever really thankful for .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 35]: Think of the monotonous execrableness of the thirty that went before it , to leave this one simple breakfast looming up in my memory like a shot-tower after all these years have gone by !
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 28]: At five P.M. we reached Fort Bridger , one hundred and seventeen miles from the South Pass , and one thousand and twenty-five miles from St. Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 22]: Fifty-two miles further on , near the head of Echo Canyon , we met sixty United States soldiers from Camp Floyd .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 25]: The day before , they had fired upon three hundred or four hundred Indians , whom they supposed gathered together for no good purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 24]: In the fight that had ensued , four Indians were captured , and the main body chased four miles , but nobody killed .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 5]: This looked like business .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 35]: We had a notion to get out and join the sixty soldiers , but upon reflecting that there were four hundred of the Indians , we concluded to go on and join the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 7]: Echo Canyon is twenty miles long .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 42]: It was like a long , smooth , narrow street , with a gradual descending grade , and shut in by enormous perpendicular walls of coarse conglomerate , four hundred feet high in many places , and turreted like mediaeval castles .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 25]: This was the most faultless piece of road in the mountains , and the driver said he would `` let his team out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 32]: He did , and if the Pacific express trains whiz through there now any faster than we did then in the stage-coach , I envy the passengers the exhilaration of it .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 26]: We fairly seemed to pick up our wheels and fly -- and the mail matter was lifted up free from everything and held in solution !
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 17]: I am not given to exaggeration , and when I say a thing I mean it .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 5]: However , time presses .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 47]: At four in the afternoon we arrived on the summit of Big Mountain , fifteen miles from Salt Lake City , when all the world was glorified with the setting sun , and the most stupendous panorama of mountain peaks yet encountered burst on our sight .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 16]: We looked out upon this sublime spectacle from under the arch of a brilliant rainbow !
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 10]: Even the overland stage-driver stopped his horses and gazed !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 23]: Half an hour or an hour later , we changed horses , and took supper with a Mormon `` Destroying Angel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 28]: `` Destroying Angels , '' as I understand it , are Latter-Day Saints who are set apart by the Church to conduct permanent disappearances of obnoxious citizens .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 35]: I had heard a deal about these Mormon Destroying Angels and the dark and bloody deeds they had done , and when I entered this one 's house I had my shudder all ready .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 21]: But alas for all our romances , he was nothing but a loud , profane , offensive , old blackguard !
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 28]: He was murderous enough , possibly , to fill the bill of a Destroyer , but would you have any kind of an Angel devoid of dignity ?
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 13]: Could you abide an Angel in an unclean shirt and no suspenders ?
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 15]: Could you respect an Angel with a horse-laugh and a swagger like a buccaneer ?
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 11]: There were other blackguards present -- comrades of this one .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 29]: And there was one person that looked like a gentleman -- Heber C. Kimball 's son , tall and well made , and thirty years old , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 46]: A lot of slatternly women flitted hither and thither in a hurry , with coffee-pots , plates of bread , and other appurtenances to supper , and these were said to be the wives of the Angel -- or some of them , at least .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 44]: And of course they were ; for if they had been hired `` help '' they would not have let an angel from above storm and swear at them as he did , let alone one from the place this one hailed from .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 20]: This was our first experience of the western `` peculiar institution , '' and it was not very prepossessing .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 41]: We did not tarry long to observe it , but hurried on to the home of the Latter-Day Saints , the stronghold of the prophets , the capital of the only absolute monarch in America -- Great Salt Lake City .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 18]: As the night closed in we took sanctuary in the Salt Lake House and unpacked our baggage .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 23]: We had a fine supper , of the freshest meats and fowls and vegetables -- a great variety and as great abundance .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 34]: We walked about the streets some , afterward , and glanced in at shops and stores ; and there was fascination in surreptitiously staring at every creature we took to be a Mormon .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 24]: This was fairy-land to us , to all intents and purposes -- a land of enchantment , and goblins , and awful mystery .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 81]: We felt a curiosity to ask every child how many mothers it had , and if it could tell them apart ; and we experienced a thrill every time a dwelling-house door opened and shut as we passed , disclosing a glimpse of human heads and backs and shoulders -- for we so longed to have a good satisfying look at a Mormon family in all its comprehensive ampleness , disposed in the customary concentric rings of its home circle .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 26]: By and by the Acting Governor of the Territory introduced us to other `` Gentiles , '' and we spent a sociable hour with them .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 10]: `` Gentiles '' are people who are not Mormons .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 76]: Our fellow-passenger , Bemis , took care of himself , during this part of the evening , and did not make an overpowering success of it , either , for he came into our room in the hotel about eleven o'clock , full of cheerfulness , and talking loosely , disjointedly and indiscriminately , and every now and then tugging out a ragged word by the roots that had more hiccups than syllables in it .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 88]: This , together with his hanging his coat on the floor on one side of a chair , and his vest on the floor on the other side , and piling his pants on the floor just in front of the same chair , and then comtemplating the general result with superstitious awe , and finally pronouncing it `` too many for him '' and going to bed with his boots on , led us to fear that something he had eaten had not agreed with him .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 13]: But we knew afterward that it was something he had been drinking .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 12]: It was the exclusively Mormon refresher , `` valley tan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 36]: Valley tan -LRB- or , at least , one form of valley tan -RRB- is a kind of whisky , or first cousin to it ; is of Mormon invention and manufactured only in Utah .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 13]: Tradition says it is made of -LRB- imported -RRB- fire and brimstone .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 36]: If I remember rightly no public drinking saloons were allowed in the kingdom by Brigham Young , and no private drinking permitted among the faithful , except they confined themselves to `` valley tan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 126]: Next day we strolled about everywhere through the broad , straight , level streets , and enjoyed the pleasant strangeness of a city of fifteen thousand inhabitants with no loafers perceptible in it ; and no visible drunkards or noisy people ; a limpid stream rippling and dancing through every street in place of a filthy gutter ; block after block of trim dwellings , built of `` frame '' and sunburned brick -- a great thriving orchard and garden behind every one of them , apparently -- branches from the street stream winding and sparkling among the garden beds and fruit trees -- and a grand general air of neatness , repair , thrift and comfort , around and about and over the whole .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 52]: And everywhere were workshops , factories , and all manner of industries ; and intent faces and busy hands were to be seen wherever one looked ; and in one 's ears was the ceaseless clink of hammers , the buzz of trade and the contented hum of drums and fly-wheels .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 40]: The armorial crest of my own State consisted of two dissolute bears holding up the head of a dead and gone cask between them and making the pertinent remark , `` UNITED , WE STAND -- -LRB- hic ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 7]: -- DIVIDED , WE FALL . ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 12]: It was always too figurative for the author of this book .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 7]: But the Mormon crest was easy .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 13]: And it was simple , unostentatious , and fitted like a glove .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 16]: It was a representation of a GOLDEN BEEHIVE , with the bees all at work !
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 55]: The city lies in the edge of a level plain as broad as the State of Connecticut , and crouches close down to the ground under a curving wall of mighty mountains whose heads are hidden in the clouds , and whose shoulders bear relics of the snows of winter all the summer long .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 42]: Seen from one of these dizzy heights , twelve or fifteen miles off , Great Salt Lake City is toned down and diminished till it is suggestive of a child 's toy-village reposing under the majestic protection of the Chinese wall .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 30]: On some of those mountains , to the southwest , it had been raining every day for two weeks , but not a drop had fallen in the city .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 38]: And on hot days in late spring and early autumn the citizens could quit fanning and growling and go out and cool off by looking at the luxury of a glorious snow-storm going on in the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 29]: They could enjoy it at a distance , at those seasons , every day , though no snow would fall in their streets , or anywhere near them .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 11]: Salt Lake City was healthy -- an extremely healthy city .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 35]: They declared there was only one physician in the place and he was arrested every week regularly and held to answer under the vagrant act for having `` no visible means of support . ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 23]: They always give you a good substantial article of truth in Salt Lake , and good measure and good weight , too .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 24]: -LSB- Very often , if you wished to weigh one of their airiest little commonplace statements you would want the hay scales . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 82]: We desired to visit the famous inland sea , the American `` Dead Sea , '' the great Salt Lake -- seventeen miles , horseback , from the city -- for we had dreamed about it , and thought about it , and talked about it , and yearned to see it , all the first part of our trip ; but now when it was only arm 's length away it had suddenly lost nearly every bit of its interest .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 29]: And so we put it off , in a sort of general way , till next day -- and that was the last we ever thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 45]: We dined with some hospitable Gentiles ; and visited the foundation of the prodigious temple ; and talked long with that shrewd Connecticut Yankee , Heber C. Kimball -LRB- since deceased -RRB- , a saint of high degree and a mighty man of commerce .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 35]: We saw the `` Tithing-House , '' and the `` Lion House , '' and I do not know or remember how many more church and government buildings of various kinds and curious names .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 31]: We flitted hither and thither and enjoyed every hour , and picked up a great deal of useful information and entertaining nonsense , and went to bed at night satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 31]: The second day , we made the acquaintance of Mr. Street -LRB- since deceased -RRB- and put on white shirts and went and paid a state visit to the king .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 32]: He seemed a quiet , kindly , easy-mannered , dignified , self-possessed old gentleman of fifty-five or sixty , and had a gentle craft in his eye that probably belonged there .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 17]: He was very simply dressed and was just taking off a straw hat as we entered .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 31]: He talked about Utah , and the Indians , and Nevada , and general American matters and questions , with our secretary and certain government officials who came with us .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 31]: But he never paid any attention to me , notwithstanding I made several attempts to `` draw him out '' on federal politics and his high handed attitude toward Congress .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 12]: I thought some of the things I said were rather fine .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 33]: But he merely looked around at me , at distant intervals , something as I have seen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was meddling with her tail .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 32]: By and by I subsided into an indignant silence , and so sat until the end , hot and flushed , and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant savage .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 5]: But he was calm .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 18]: His conversation with those gentlemen flowed on as sweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer brook .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 44]: When the audience was ended and we were retiring from the presence , he put his hand on my head , beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my brother : `` Ah -- your child , I presume ?
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 6]: Boy , or girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 55]: Mr. Street was very busy with his telegraphic matters -- and considering that he had eight or nine hundred miles of rugged , snowy , uninhabited mountains , and waterless , treeless , melancholy deserts to traverse with his wire , it was natural and needful that he should be as busy as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 49]: He could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the road-side , either , but they had to be hauled by ox teams across those exhausting deserts -- and it was two days ' journey from water to water , in one or two of them .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 60]: Mr. Street 's contract was a vast work , every way one looked at it ; and yet to comprehend what the vague words `` eight hundred miles of rugged mountains and dismal deserts '' mean , one must go over the ground in person -- pen and ink descriptions can not convey the dreary reality to the reader .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 25]: And after all , Mr. S. 's mightiest difficulty turned out to be one which he had never taken into the account at all .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 65]: Unto Mormons he had sub-let the hardest and heaviest half of his great undertaking , and all of a sudden they concluded that they were going to make little or nothing , and so they tranquilly threw their poles overboard in mountain or desert , just as it happened when they took the notion , and drove home and went about their customary business !
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 18]: They were under written contract to Mr. Street , but they did not care anything for that .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 24]: They said they would `` admire '' to see a `` Gentile '' force a Mormon to fulfil a losing contract in Utah !
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 10]: And they made themselves very merry over the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 19]: Street said -- for it was he that told us these things : `` I was in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 23]: I was under heavy bonds to complete my contract in a given time , and this disaster looked very much like ruin .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 20]: It was an astounding thing ; it was such a wholly unlooked-for difficulty , that I was entirely nonplussed .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 45]: I am a business man -- have always been a business man -- do not know anything but business -- and so you can imagine how like being struck by lightning it was to find myself in a country where written contracts were worthless !
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 15]: -- that main security , that sheet-anchor , that absolute necessity , of business .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 5]: My confidence left me .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 13]: There was no use in making new contracts -- that was plain .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 11]: I talked with first one prominent citizen and then another .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 19]: They all sympathized with me , first rate , but they did not know how to help me .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 13]: But at last a Gentile said , ` Go to Brigham Young !
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 12]: -- these small fry can not do you any good . '
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 39]: I did not think much of the idea , for if the law could not help me , what could an individual do who had not even anything to do with either making the laws or executing them ?
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 35]: He might be a very good patriarch of a church and preacher in its tabernacle , but something sterner than religion and moral suasion was needed to handle a hundred refractory , half-civilized sub-contractors .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 8]: But what was a man to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 43]: I thought if Mr. Young could not do anything else , he might probably be able to give me some advice and a valuable hint or two , and so I went straight to him and laid the whole case before him .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 15]: He said very little , but he showed strong interest all the way through .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 46]: He examined all the papers in detail , and whenever there seemed anything like a hitch , either in the papers or my statement , he would go back and take up the thread and follow it patiently out to an intelligent and satisfactory result .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 11]: Then he made a list of the contractors ' names .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 15]: Finally he said : '' ` Mr. Street , this is all perfectly plain .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 15]: These contracts are strictly and legally drawn , and are duly signed and certified .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 11]: These men manifestly entered into them with their eyes open .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 9]: I see no fault or flaw anywhere . '
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 42]: `` Then Mr. Young turned to a man waiting at the other end of the room and said : ` Take this list of names to So-and-so , and tell him to have these men here at such-and-such an hour . '
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 9]: `` They were there , to the minute .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 4]: So was I .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 17]: Mr. Young asked them a number of questions , and their answers made my statement good .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 26]: Then he said to them : '' ` You signed these contracts and assumed these obligations of your own free will and accord ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 5]: ` Yes . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 16]: ` Then carry them out to the letter , if it makes paupers of you !
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 3]: Go ! '
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 8]: `` And they did go , too !
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 12]: They are strung across the deserts now , working like bees .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 10]: And I never hear a word out of them .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 50]: `` There is a batch of governors , and judges , and other officials here , shipped from Washington , and they maintain the semblance of a republican form of government -- but the petrified truth is that Utah is an absolute monarchy and Brigham Young is king ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 13]: Mr. Street was a fine man , and I believe his story .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 12]: I knew him well during several years afterward in San Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 52]: Our stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days , and therefore we had no time to make the customary inquisition into the workings of polygamy and get up the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to calling the attention of the nation at large once more to the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 8]: I had the will to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 27]: With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I was feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform here -- until I saw the Mormon women .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 5]: Then I was touched .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 8]: My heart was wiser than my head .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 94]: It warmed toward these poor , ungainly and pathetically `` homely '' creatures , and as I turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes , I said , `` No -- the man that marries one of them has done an act of Christian charity which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind , not their harsh censure -- and the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of open-handed generosity so sublime that the nations should stand uncovered in his presence and worship in silence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 25]: -LSB- For a brief sketch of Mormon history , and the noted Mountain Meadow massacre , see Appendices A and B. -RSB- CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 15]: It is a luscious country for thrilling evening stories about assassinations of intractable Gentiles .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 56]: I can not easily conceive of anything more cosy than the night in Salt Lake which we spent in a Gentile den , smoking pipes and listening to tales of how Burton galloped in among the pleading and defenceless `` Morisites '' and shot them down , men and women , like so many dogs .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 23]: And how Bill Hickman , a Destroying Angel , shot Drown and Arnold dead for bringing suit against him for a debt .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 11]: And how Porter Rockwell did this and that dreadful thing .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 49]: And how heedless people often come to Utah and make remarks about Brigham , or polygamy , or some other sacred matter , and the very next morning at daylight such parties are sure to be found lying up some back alley , contentedly waiting for the hearse .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 85]: And the next most interesting thing is to sit and listen to these Gentiles talk about polygamy ; and how some portly old frog of an elder , or a bishop , marries a girl -- likes her , marries her sister -- likes her , marries another sister -- likes her , takes another -- likes her , marries her mother -- likes her , marries her father , grandfather , great grandfather , and then comes back hungry and asks for more .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 48]: And how the pert young thing of eleven will chance to be the favorite wife and her own venerable grandmother have to rank away down toward D 4 in their mutual husband 's esteem , and have to sleep in the kitchen , as like as not .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 96]: And how this dreadful sort of thing , this hiving together in one foul nest of mother and daughters , and the making a young daughter superior to her own mother in rank and authority , are things which Mormon women submit to because their religion teaches them that the more wives a man has on earth , and the more children he rears , the higher the place they will all have in the world to come -- and the warmer , maybe , though they do not seem to say anything about that .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 18]: According to these Gentile friends of ours , Brigham Young 's harem contains twenty or thirty wives .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 38]: They said that some of them had grown old and gone out of active service , but were comfortably housed and cared for in the henery -- or the Lion House , as it is strangely named .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 11]: Along with each wife were her children -- fifty altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 14]: The house was perfectly quiet and orderly , when the children were still .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 21]: They all took their meals in one room , and a happy and home-like sight it was pronounced to be .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 34]: None of our party got an opportunity to take dinner with Mr. Young , but a Gentile by the name of Johnson professed to have enjoyed a sociable breakfast in the Lion House .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 30]: He gave a preposterous account of the `` calling of the roll , '' and other preliminaries , and the carnage that ensued when the buckwheat cakes came in .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 7]: But he embellished rather too much .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 70]: He said that Mr. Young told him several smart sayings of certain of his `` two-year-olds , '' observing with some pride that for many years he had been the heaviest contributor in that line to one of the Eastern magazines ; and then he wanted to show Mr. Johnson one of the pets that had said the last good thing , but he could not find the child .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 19]: He searched the faces of the children in detail , but could not decide which one it was .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 27]: Finally he gave it up with a sigh and said : `` I thought I would know the little cub again but I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 46]: Mr. Johnson said further , that Mr. Young observed that life was a sad , sad thing -- `` because the joy of every new marriage a man contracted was so apt to be blighted by the inopportune funeral of a less recent bride . ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 70]: And Mr. Johnson said that while he and Mr. Young were pleasantly conversing in private , one of the Mrs. Youngs came in and demanded a breast-pin , remarking that she had found out that he had been giving a breast-pin to No. 6 , and she , for one , did not propose to let this partiality go on without making a satisfactory amount of trouble about it .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 11]: Mr. Young reminded her that there was a stranger present .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 25]: Mrs. Young said that if the state of things inside the house was not agreeable to the stranger , he could find room outside .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 11]: Mr. Young promised the breast-pin , and she went away .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 16]: But in a minute or two another Mrs. Young came in and demanded a breast-pin .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 13]: Mr. Young began a remonstrance , but Mrs. Young cut him short .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 38]: She said No. 6 had got one , and No. 11 was promised one , and it was `` no use for him to try to impose on her -- she hoped she knew her rights . ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 9]: He gave his promise , and she went .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 24]: And presently three Mrs. Youngs entered in a body and opened on their husband a tempest of tears , abuse , and entreaty .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 15]: They had heard all about No. 6 , No. 11 , and No. 14 .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 6]: Three more breast-pins were promised .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 30]: They were hardly gone when nine more Mrs. Youngs filed into the presence , and a new tempest burst forth and raged round about the prophet and his guest .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 13]: Nine breast-pins were promised , and the weird sisters filed out again .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 14]: And in came eleven more , weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 8]: Eleven promised breast-pins purchased peace once more .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 11]: `` That is a specimen , '' said Mr. Young .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 7]: `` You see how it is .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 8]: You see what a life I lead .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 10]: A man ca n't be wise all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 31]: In a heedless moment I gave my darling No. 6 -- excuse my calling her thus , as her other name has escaped me for the moment -- a breast-pin .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 31]: It was only worth twenty-five dollars -- that is , apparently that was its whole cost -- but its ultimate cost was inevitably bound to be a good deal more .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 24]: You yourself have seen it climb up to six hundred and fifty dollars -- and alas , even that is not the end !
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 11]: For I have wives all over this Territory of Utah .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 21]: I have dozens of wives whose numbers , even , I do not know without looking in the family Bible .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 15]: They are scattered far and wide among the mountains and valleys of my realm .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 29]: And mark you , every solitary one of them will hear of this wretched breast pin , and every last one of them will have one or die .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 19]: No. 6 's breast pin will cost me twenty-five hundred dollars before I see the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 45]: And these creatures will compare these pins together , and if one is a shade finer than the rest , they will all be thrown on my hands , and I will have to order a new lot to keep peace in the family .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 30]: Sir , you probably did not know it , but all the time you were present with my children your every movement was watched by vigilant servitors of mine .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 47]: If you had offered to give a child a dime , or a stick of candy , or any trifle of the kind , you would have been snatched out of the house instantly , provided it could be done before your gift left your hand .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 49]: Otherwise it would be absolutely necessary for you to make an exactly similar gift to all my children -- and knowing by experience the importance of the thing , I would have stood by and seen to it myself that you did it , and did it thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 45]: Once a gentleman gave one of my children a tin whistle -- a veritable invention of Satan , sir , and one which I have an unspeakable horror of , and so would you if you had eighty or ninety children in your house .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 10]: But the deed was done -- the man escaped .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 16]: I knew what the result was going to be , and I thirsted for vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 23]: I ordered out a flock of Destroying Angels , and they hunted the man far into the fastnesses of the Nevada mountains .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 6]: But they never caught him .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 47]: I am not cruel , sir -- I am not vindictive except when sorely outraged -- but if I had caught him , sir , so help me Joseph Smith , I would have locked him into the nursery till the brats whistled him to death .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 14]: By the slaughtered body of St. Parley Pratt -LRB- whom God assail ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 10]: there was never anything on this earth like it !
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 22]: I knew who gave the whistle to the child , but I could , not make those jealous mothers believe me .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 101]: They believed I did it , and the result was just what any man of reflection could have foreseen : I had to order a hundred and ten whistles -- I think we had a hundred and ten children in the house then , but some of them are off at college now -- I had to order a hundred and ten of those shrieking things , and I wish I may never speak another word if we did n't have to talk on our fingers entirely , from that time forth until the children got tired of the whistles .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 29]: And if ever another man gives a whistle to a child of mine and I get my hands on him , I will hang him higher than Haman !
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 10]: That is the word with the bark on it !
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 4]: Shade of Nephi !
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 9]: You do n't know anything about married life .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 9]: I am rich , and everybody knows it .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 11]: I am benevolent , and everybody takes advantage of it .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 15]: I have a strong fatherly instinct and all the foundlings are foisted on me .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 29]: `` Every time a woman wants to do well by her darling , she puzzles her brain to cipher out some scheme for getting it into my hands .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 70]: Why , sir , a woman came here once with a child of a curious lifeless sort of complexion -LRB- and so had the woman -RRB- , and swore that the child was mine and she my wife -- that I had married her at such-and-such a time in such-and-such a place , but she had forgotten her number , and of course I could not remember her name .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 53]: Well , sir , she called my attention to the fact that the child looked like me , and really it did seem to resemble me -- a common thing in the Territory -- and , to cut the story short , I put it in my nursery , and she left .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 23]: And by the ghost of Orson Hyde , when they came to wash the paint off that child it was an Injun !
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 13]: Bless my soul , you do n't know anything about married life .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 16]: It is a perfect dog 's life , sir -- a perfect dog 's life .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 5]: You ca n't economize .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 5]: It is n't possible .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 13]: I have tried keeping one set of bridal attire for all occasions .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 7]: But it is of no use .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 51]: First you 'll marry a combination of calico and consumption that 's as thin as a rail , and next you 'll get a creature that 's nothing more than the dropsy in disguise , and then you 've got to eke out that bridal dress with an old balloon .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 7]: That is the way it goes .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 20]: And think of the wash-bill -- -LRB- excuse these tears -RRB- -- nine hundred and eighty-four pieces a week !
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 18]: No , sir , there is no such a thing as economy in a family like mine .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 13]: Why , just the one item of cradles -- think of it !
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 3]: And vermifuge !
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 3]: Soothing syrup !
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 3]: Teething rings !
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 13]: And ` papa 's watches ' for the babies to play with !
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 8]: And things to scratch the furniture with !
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 17]: And lucifer matches for them to eat , and pieces of glass to cut themselves with !
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 17]: The item of glass alone would support your family , I venture to say , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 28]: Let me scrimp and squeeze all I can , I still ca n't get ahead as fast as I feel I ought to , with my opportunities .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 70]: Bless you , sir , at a time when I had seventy-two wives in this house , I groaned under the pressure of keeping thousands of dollars tied up in seventy-two bedsteads when the money ought to have been out at interest ; and I just sold out the whole stock , sir , at a sacrifice , and built a bedstead seven feet long and ninety-six feet wide .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 8]: But it was a failure , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 5]: I could not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 13]: It appeared to me that the whole seventy-two women snored at once .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 5]: The roar was deafening .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 7]: And then the danger of it !
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 8]: That was what I was looking at .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 58]: They would all draw in their breath at once , and you could actually see the walls of the house suck in -- and then they would all exhale their breath at once , and you could see the walls swell out , and strain , and hear the rafters crack , and the shingles grind together .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 31]: My friend , take an old man 's advice , and do n't encumber yourself with a large family -- mind , I tell you , do n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 65]: In a small family , and in a small family only , you will find that comfort and that peace of mind which are the best at last of the blessings this world is able to afford us , and for the lack of which no accumulation of wealth , and no acquisition of fame , power , and greatness can ever compensate us .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 21]: Take my word for it , ten or eleven wives is all you need -- never go over it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 14]: Some instinct or other made me set this Johnson down as being unreliable .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 29]: And yet he was a very entertaining person , and I doubt if some of the information he gave us could have been acquired from any other source .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 10]: He was a pleasant contrast to those reticent Mormons .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 32]: All men have heard of the Mormon Bible , but few except the `` elect '' have seen it , or , at least , taken the trouble to read it .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 9]: I brought away a copy from Salt Lake .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 32]: The book is a curiosity to me , it is such a pretentious affair , and yet so `` slow , '' so sleepy ; such an insipid mess of inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 6]: It is chloroform in print .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 25]: If Joseph Smith composed this book , the act was a miracle -- keeping awake while he did it was , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 47]: If he , according to tradition , merely translated it from certain ancient and mysteriously-engraved plates of copper , which he declares he found under a stone , in an out-of-the-way locality , the work of translating was equally a miracle , for the same reason .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 31]: The book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history , with the Old Testament for a model ; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New Testament .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 44]: The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint , old-fashioned sound and structure of our King James 's translation of the Scriptures ; and the result is a mongrel -- half modern glibness , and half ancient simplicity and gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 17]: The latter is awkward and constrained ; the former natural , but grotesque by the contrast .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 47]: Whenever he found his speech growing too modern -- which was about every sentence or two -- he ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as `` exceeding sore , '' `` and it came to pass , '' etc. , and made things satisfactory again .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 11]: `` And it came to pass '' was his pet .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 16]: If he had left that out , his Bible would have been only a pamphlet .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 29]: The title-page reads as follows : THE BOOK OF MORMON : AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF MORMON , UPON PLATES TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 59]: Wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi , and also of the Lamanites ; written to the Lamanites , who are a remnant of the House of Israel ; and also to Jew and Gentile ; written by way of commandment , and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 69]: Written and sealed up , and hid up unto the Lord , that they might not be destroyed ; to come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof ; sealed by the hand of Moroni , and hid up unto the Lord , to come forth in due time by the way of Gentile ; the interpretation thereof by the gift of God .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 45]: An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also ; which is a record of the people of Jared ; who were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people when they were building a tower to get to Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 7]: `` Hid up '' is good .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 13]: And so is `` wherefore '' -- though why `` wherefore '' ?
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 21]: Any other word would have answered as well -- though -- in truth it would not have sounded so Scriptural .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: Next comes : THE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 122]: Be it known unto all nations , kindreds , tongues , and people unto whom this work shall come , that we , through the grace of God the Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , have seen the plates which contain this record , which is a record of the people of Nephi , and also of the Lamanites , their brethren , and also of the people of Jared , who came from the tower of which hath been spoken ; and we also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of God , for His voice hath declared it unto us ; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 34]: And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which are upon the plates ; and they have been shown unto us by the power of God , and not of man .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 114]: And we declare with words of soberness , that an angel of God came down from heaven , and he brought and laid before our eyes , that we beheld and saw the plates , and the engravings thereon ; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , that we beheld and bear record that these things are true ; and it is marvellous in our eyes ; nevertheless the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it ; wherefore , to be obedient unto the commandments of God , we bear testimony of these things .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 43]: And we know that if we are faithful in Christ , we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men , and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of Christ , and shall dwell with Him eternally in the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 24]: And the honor be to the Father , and to the Son , and to the Holy Ghost , which is one God .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 2]: Amen .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 9]: OLIVER COWDERY , DAVID WHITMER , MARTIN HARRIS .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 113]: Some people have to have a world of evidence before they can come anywhere in the neighborhood of believing anything ; but for me , when a man tells me that he has `` seen the engravings which are upon the plates , '' and not only that , but an angel was there at the time , and saw him see them , and probably took his receipt for it , I am very far on the road to conviction , no matter whether I ever heard of that man before or not , and even if I do not know the name of the angel , or his nationality either .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 12]: Next is this : AND ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 94]: Be it known unto all nations , kindreds , tongues , and people unto whom this work shall come , that Joseph Smith , Jr. , the translator of this work , has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken , which have the appearance of gold ; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated , we did handle with our hands ; and we also saw the engravings thereon , all of which has the appearance of ancient work , and of curious workmanship .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 45]: And this we bear record with words of soberness , that the said Smith has shown unto us , for we have seen and hefted , and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 31]: And we give our names unto the world , to witness unto the world that which we have seen ; and we lie not , God bearing witness of it .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 29]: CHRISTIAN WHITMER , JACOB WHITMER , PETER WHITMER , JR. , JOHN WHITMER , HIRAM PAGE , JOSEPH SMITH , SR. , HYRUM SMITH , SAMUEL H. SMITH .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 50]: And when I am far on the road to conviction , and eight men , be they grammatical or otherwise , come forward and tell me that they have seen the plates too ; and not only seen those plates but `` hefted '' them , I am convinced .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 17]: I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 46]: The Mormon Bible consists of fifteen `` books '' -- being the books of Jacob , Enos , Jarom , Omni , Mosiah , Zeniff , Alma , Helaman , Ether , Moroni , two `` books '' of Mormon , and three of Nephi .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 66]: In the first book of Nephi is a plagiarism of the Old Testament , which gives an account of the exodus from Jerusalem of the `` children of Lehi '' ; and it goes on to tell of their wanderings in the wilderness , during eight years , and their supernatural protection by one of their number , a party by the name of Nephi .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 16]: They finally reached the land of `` Bountiful , '' and camped by the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 42]: After they had remained there `` for the space of many days '' -- which is more Scriptural than definite -- Nephi was commanded from on high to build a ship wherein to `` carry the people across the waters . ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 17]: He travestied Noah 's ark -- but he obeyed orders in the matter of the plan .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 46]: He finished the ship in a single day , while his brethren stood by and made fun of it -- and of him , too -- `` saying , our brother is a fool , for he thinketh that he can build a ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 21]: They did not wait for the timbers to dry , but the whole tribe or nation sailed the next day .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 26]: Then a bit of genuine nature cropped out , and is revealed by outspoken Nephi with Scriptural frankness -- they all got on a spree !
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 43]: They , `` and also their wives , began to make themselves merry , insomuch that they began to dance , and to sing , and to speak with much rudeness ; yea , they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 23]: Nephi tried to stop these scandalous proceedings ; but they tied him neck and heels , and went on with their lark .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 118]: But observe how Nephi the prophet circumvented them by the aid of the invisible powers : And it came to pass that after they had bound me , insomuch that I could not move , the compass , which had been prepared of the Lord , did cease to work ; wherefore , they knew not whither they should steer the ship , insomuch that there arose a great storm , yea , a great and terrible tempest , and we were driven back upon the waters for the space of three days ; and they began to be frightened exceedingly , lest they should be drowned in the sea ; nevertheless they did not loose me .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 21]: And on the fourth day , which we had been driven back , the tempest began to be exceeding sore .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 20]: And it came to pass that we were about to be swallowed up in the depths of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 5]: Then they untied him .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 27]: And it came to pass after they had loosed me , behold , I took the compass , and it did work whither I desired it .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 36]: And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord ; and after I had prayed , the winds did cease , and the storm did cease , and there was a great calm .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 16]: Equipped with their compass , these ancients appear to have had the advantage of Noah .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 17]: Their voyage was toward a `` promised land '' -- the only name they give it .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 6]: They reached it in safety .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 22]: Polygamy is a recent feature in the Mormon religion , and was added by Brigham Young after Joseph Smith 's death .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 12]: Before that , it was regarded as an `` abomination . ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 11]: This verse from the Mormon Bible occurs in Chapter II .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 53]: of the book of Jacob : For behold , thus saith the Lord , this people begin to wax in iniquity ; they understand not the Scriptures ; for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms , because of the things which were written concerning David , and Solomon his son .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 69]: Behold , David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines , which thing was abominable before me , saith the Lord ; wherefore , thus saith the Lord , I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem , by the power of mine arm , that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 21]: Wherefore , I the Lord God , will no suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 23]: However , the project failed -- or at least the modern Mormon end of it -- for Brigham `` suffers '' it .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 75]: This verse is from the same chapter : Behold , the Lamanites your brethren , whom ye hate , because of their filthiness and the cursings which hath come upon their skins , are more righteous than you ; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the Lord , which was given unto our fathers , that they should have , save it were one wife ; and concubines they should have none .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 8]: The following verse -LRB- from Chapter IX .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 53]: of the Book of Nephi -RRB- appears to contain information not familiar to everybody : And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into heaven , the multitude did disperse , and every man did take his wife and his children , and did return to his own home .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 90]: And it came to pass that on the morrow , when the multitude was gathered together , behold , Nephi and his brother whom he had raised from the dead , whose name was Timothy , and also his son , whose name was Jonas , and also Mathoni , and Mathonihah , his brother , and Kumen , and Kumenenhi , and Jeremiah , and Shemnon , and Jonas , and Zedekiah , and Isaiah ; now these were the names of the disciples whom Jesus had chosen .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 72]: In order that the reader may observe how much more grandeur and picturesqueness -LRB- as seen by these Mormon twelve -RRB- accompanied on of the tenderest episodes in the life of our Saviour than other eyes seem to have been aware of , I quote the following from the same `` book '' -- Nephi : And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them , and bade them arise .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 21]: And they arose from the earth , and He said unto them , Blessed are ye because of your faith .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 9]: And now behold , My joy is full .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 42]: And when He had said these words , He wept , and the multitude bear record of it , and He took their little children , one by one , and blessed them , and prayed unto the Father for them .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 27]: And when He had done this He wept again , and He spake unto the multitude , and saith unto them , Behold your little ones .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 126]: And as they looked to behold , they cast their eyes toward heaven , and they saw the heavens open , and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were , in the midst of fire ; and they came down and encircled those little ones about , and they were encircled about with fire ; and the angels did minister unto them , and the multitude did see and hear and bear record ; and they know that their record is true , for they all of them did see and hear , every man for himself ; and they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls ; and they did consist of men , women , and children .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 11]: And what else would they be likely to consist of ?
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 47]: The Book of Ether is an incomprehensible medley of if `` history , '' much of it relating to battles and sieges among peoples whom the reader has possibly never heard of ; and who inhabited a country which is not set down in the geography .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 105]: These was a King with the remarkable name of Coriantumr , and he warred with Shared , and Lib , and Shiz , and others , in the `` plains of Heshlon '' ; and the `` valley of Gilgal '' ; and the `` wilderness of Akish '' ; and the `` land of Moran '' ; and the `` plains of Agosh '' ; and `` Ogath , '' and `` Ramah , '' and the `` land of Corihor , '' and the `` hill Comnor , '' by `` the waters of Ripliancum , '' etc. , etc. , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 64]: `` And it came to pass , '' after a deal of fighting , that Coriantumr , upon making calculation of his losses , found that `` there had been slain two millions of mighty men , and also their wives and their children '' -- say 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 in all -- `` and he began to sorrow in his heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 5]: Unquestionably it was time .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 24]: So he wrote to Shiz , asking a cessation of hostilities , and offering to give up his kingdom to save his people .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 27]: Shiz declined , except upon condition that Coriantumr would come and let him cut his head off first -- a thing which Coriantumr would not do .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 62]: Then there was more fighting for a season ; then four years were devoted to gathering the forces for a final struggle -- after which ensued a battle , which , I take it , is the most remarkable set forth in history , -- except , perhaps , that of the Kilkenny cats , which it resembles in some respects .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 13]: This is the account of the gathering and the battle : 7 .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 33]: And it came to pass that they did gather together all the people , upon all the face of the land , who had not been slain , save it was Ether .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 98]: And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the doings of the people ; and he beheld that the people who were for Coriantumr , were gathered together to the army of Coriantumr ; and the people who were for Shiz , were gathered together to the army of Shiz ; wherefore they were for the space of four years gathering together the people , that they might get all who were upon the face of the land , and that they might receive all the strength which it was possible that they could receive .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 83]: And it came to pass that when they were all gathered together , every one to the army which he would , with their wives and their children ; both men , women , and children being armed with weapons of war , having shields , and breast-plates , and head-plates , and being clothed after the manner of war , they did march forth one against another , to battle ; and they fought all that day , and conquered not .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 67]: And it came to pass that when it was night they were weary , and retired to their camps ; and after they had retired to their camps , they took up a howling and a lamentation for the loss of the slain of their people ; and so great were their cries , their howlings and lamentations , that it did rend the air exceedingly .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 63]: And it came to pass that on the morrow they did go again to battle , and great and terrible was that day ; nevertheless they conquered not , and when the night came again , they did rend the air with their cries , and their howlings , and their mournings , for the loss of the slain of their people .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 2]: 8 .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 40]: And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle unto Shiz , desiring that he would not come again to battle , but that he would take the kingdom , and spare the lives of the people .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 57]: But behold , the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them , and Satan had full power over the hearts of the people , for they were given up unto the hardness of their hearts , and the blindness of their minds that they might be destroyed ; wherefore they went again to battle .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 106]: And it came to pass that they fought all that day , and when the night came they slept upon their swords ; and on the morrow they fought even until the night came ; and when the night came they were drunken with anger , even as a man who is drunken with wine ; and they slept again upon their swords ; and on the morrow they fought again ; and when the night came they had all fallen by the sword save it were fifty and two of the people of Coriantumr , and sixty and nine of the people of Shiz .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 67]: And it came to pass that they slept upon their swords that night , and on the morrow they fought again , and they contended in their mights with their swords , and with their shields , all that day ; and when the night came there were thirty and two of the people of Shiz , and twenty and seven of the people of Coriantumr .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 2]: 9 .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 19]: And it came to pass that they ate and slept , and prepared for death on the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 15]: And they were large and mighty men , as to the strength of men .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 24]: And it came to pass that they fought for the space of three hours , and they fainted with the loss of blood .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 84]: And it came to pass that when the men of Coriantumr had received sufficient strength , that they could walk , they were about to flee for their lives , but behold , Shiz arose , and also his men , and he swore in his wrath that he would slay Coriantumr , or he would perish by the sword : wherefore he did pursue them , and on the morrow he did overtake them ; and they fought again with the sword .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 31]: And it came to pass that when they had all fallen by the sword , save it were Coriantumr and Shiz , behold Shiz had fainted with loss of blood .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 28]: And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon his sword , that he rested a little , he smote off the head of Shiz .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 37]: And it came to pass that after he had smote off the head of Shiz , that Shiz raised upon his hands and fell ; and after that he had struggled for breath , he died .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 21]: And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the earth , and became as if he had no life .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 15]: And the Lord spake unto Ether , and said unto him , go forth .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 33]: And he went forth , and beheld that the words of the Lord had all been fulfilled ; and he finished his record ; and the hundredth part I have not written .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 31]: It seems a pity he did not finish , for after all his dreary former chapters of commonplace , he stopped just as he was in danger of becoming interesting .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 20]: The Mormon Bible is rather stupid and tiresome to read , but there is nothing vicious in its teachings .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 24]: Its code of morals is unobjectionable -- it is `` smouched '' -LSB- Milton -RSB- from the New Testament and no credit given .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 49]: At the end of our two days ' sojourn , we left Great Salt Lake City hearty and well fed and happy -- physically superb but not so very much wiser , as regards the `` Mormon question , '' than we were when we arrived , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 47]: We had a deal more `` information '' than we had before , of course , but we did not know what portion of it was reliable and what was not -- for it all came from acquaintances of a day -- strangers , strictly speaking .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 88]: We were told , for instance , that the dreadful `` Mountain Meadows Massacre '' was the work of the Indians entirely , and that the Gentiles had meanly tried to fasten it upon the Mormons ; we were told , likewise , that the Indians were to blame , partly , and partly the Mormons ; and we were told , likewise , and just as positively , that the Mormons were almost if not wholly and completely responsible for that most treacherous and pitiless butchery .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 63]: We got the story in all these different shapes , but it was not till several years afterward that Mrs. Waite 's book , `` The Mormon Prophet , '' came out with Judge Cradlebaugh 's trial of the accused parties in it and revealed the truth that the latter version was the correct one and that the Mormons were the assassins .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 31]: All our `` information '' had three sides to it , and so I gave up the idea that I could settle the `` Mormon question '' in two days .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 11]: Still I have seen newspaper correspondents do it in one .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 38]: I left Great Salt Lake a good deal confused as to what state of things existed there -- and sometimes even questioning in my own mind whether a state of things existed there at all or not .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 37]: But presently I remembered with a lightening sense of relief that we had learned two or three trivial things there which we could be certain of ; and so the two days were not wholly lost .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 22]: For instance , we had learned that we were at last in a pioneer land , in absolute and tangible reality .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 17]: The high prices charged for trifles were eloquent of high freights and bewildering distances of freightage .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 26]: In the east , in those days , the smallest moneyed denomination was a penny and it represented the smallest purchasable quantity of any commodity .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 31]: West of Cincinnati the smallest coin in use was the silver five-cent piece and no smaller quantity of an article could be bought than `` five cents ' worth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 46]: In Overland City the lowest coin appeared to be the ten-cent piece ; but in Salt Lake there did not seem to be any money in circulation smaller than a quarter , or any smaller quantity purchasable of any commodity than twenty-five cents ' worth .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 97]: We had always been used to half dimes and `` five cents ' worth '' as the minimum of financial negotiations ; but in Salt Lake if one wanted a cigar , it was a quarter ; if he wanted a chalk pipe , it was a quarter ; if he wanted a peach , or a candle , or a newspaper , or a shave , or a little Gentile whiskey to rub on his corns to arrest indigestion and keep him from having the toothache , twenty-five cents was the price , every time .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 46]: When we looked at the shot-bag of silver , now and then , we seemed to be wasting our substance in riotous living , but if we referred to the expense account we could see that we had not been doing anything of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 44]: But people easily get reconciled to big money and big prices , and fond and vain of both -- it is a descent to little coins and cheap prices that is hardest to bear and slowest to take hold upon one 's toleration .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 29]: After a month 's acquaintance with the twenty-five cent minimum , the average human being is ready to blush every time he thinks of his despicable five-cent days .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 25]: How sunburnt with blushes I used to get in gaudy Nevada , every time I thought of my first financial experience in Salt Lake .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 38]: It was on this wise -LRB- which is a favorite expression of great authors , and a very neat one , too , but I never hear anybody say on this wise when they are talking -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 19]: A young half-breed with a complexion like a yellow-jacket asked me if I would have my boots blacked .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 13]: It was at the Salt Lake House the morning after we arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 9]: I said yes , and he blacked them .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 27]: Then I handed him a silver five-cent piece , with the benevolent air of a person who is conferring wealth and blessedness upon poverty and suffering .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 26]: The yellow-jacket took it with what I judged to be suppressed emotion , and laid it reverently down in the middle of his broad hand .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 24]: Then he began to contemplate it , much as a philosopher contemplates a gnat 's ear in the ample field of his microscope .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 36]: Several mountaineers , teamsters , stage-drivers , etc. , drew near and dropped into the tableau and fell to surveying the money with that attractive indifference to formality which is noticeable in the hardy pioneer .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 41]: Presently the yellow-jacket handed the half dime back to me and told me I ought to keep my money in my pocket-book instead of in my soul , and then I would n't get it cramped and shriveled up so !
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 9]: What a roar of vulgar laughter there was !
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 36]: I destroyed the mongrel reptile on the spot , but I smiled and smiled all the time I was detaching his scalp , for the remark he made was good for an `` Injun . ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 65]: Yes , we had learned in Salt Lake to be charged great prices without letting the inward shudder appear on the surface -- for even already we had overheard and noted the tenor of conversations among drivers , conductors , and hostlers , and finally among citizens of Salt Lake , until we were well aware that these superior beings despised `` emigrants . ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 78]: We permitted no tell-tale shudders and winces in our countenances , for we wanted to seem pioneers , or Mormons , half-breeds , teamsters , stage-drivers , Mountain Meadow assassins -- anything in the world that the plains and Utah respected and admired -- but we were wretchedly ashamed of being `` emigrants , '' and sorry enough that we had white shirts and could not swear in the presence of ladies without looking the other way .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 33]: And many a time in Nevada , afterwards , we had occasion to remember with humiliation that we were `` emigrants , '' and consequently a low and inferior sort of creatures .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 89]: Perhaps the reader has visited Utah , Nevada , or California , even in these latter days , and while communing with himself upon the sorrowful banishment of these countries from what he considers `` the world , '' has had his wings clipped by finding that he is the one to be pitied , and that there are entire populations around him ready and willing to do it for him -- yea , who are complacently doing it for him already , wherever he steps his foot .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 63]: Poor thing , they are making fun of his hat ; and the cut of his New York coat ; and his conscientiousness about his grammar ; and his feeble profanity ; and his consumingly ludicrous ignorance of ores , shafts , tunnels , and other things which he never saw before , and never felt enough interest in to read about .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 65]: And all the time that he is thinking what a sad fate it is to be exiled to that far country , that lonely land , the citizens around him are looking down on him with a blighting compassion because he is an `` emigrant '' instead of that proudest and blessedest creature that exists on all the earth , a `` FORTY-NINER . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 32]: The accustomed coach life began again , now , and by midnight it almost seemed as if we never had been out of our snuggery among the mail sacks at all .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 8]: We had made one alteration , however .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 27]: We had provided enough bread , boiled ham and hard boiled eggs to last double the six hundred miles of staging we had still to do .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 46]: And it was comfort in those succeeding days to sit up and contemplate the majestic panorama of mountains and valleys spread out below us and eat ham and hard boiled eggs while our spiritual natures revelled alternately in rainbows , thunderstorms , and peerless sunsets .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 8]: Nothing helps scenery like ham and eggs .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 46]: Ham and eggs , and after these a pipe -- an old , rank , delicious pipe -- ham and eggs and scenery , a `` down grade , '' a flying coach , a fragrant pipe and a contented heart -- these make happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 10]: It is what all the ages have struggled for .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 35]: At eight in the morning we reached the remnant and ruin of what had been the important military station of `` Camp Floyd , '' some forty-five or fifty miles from Salt Lake City .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 19]: At four P.M. we had doubled our distance and were ninety or a hundred miles from Salt Lake .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 29]: And now we entered upon one of that species of deserts whose concentrated hideousness shames the diffused and diluted horrors of Sahara -- an `` alkali '' desert .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 11]: For sixty-eight miles there was but one break in it .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 34]: I do not remember that this was really a break ; indeed it seems to me that it was nothing but a watering depot in the midst of the stretch of sixty-eight miles .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 35]: If my memory serves me , there was no well or spring at this place , but the water was hauled there by mule and ox teams from the further side of the desert .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 7]: There was a stage station there .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 19]: It was forty-five miles from the beginning of the desert , and twenty-three from the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 42]: We plowed and dragged and groped along , the whole live-long night , and at the end of this uncomfortable twelve hours we finished the forty-five-mile part of the desert and got to the stage station where the imported water was .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 6]: The sun was just rising .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 51]: It was easy enough to cross a desert in the night while we were asleep ; and it was pleasant to reflect , in the morning , that we in actual person had encountered an absolute desert and could always speak knowingly of deserts in presence of the ignorant thenceforward .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 33]: And it was pleasant also to reflect that this was not an obscure , back country desert , but a very celebrated one , the metropolis itself , as you may say .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 22]: All this was very well and very comfortable and satisfactory -- but now we were to cross a desert in daylight .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 24]: This was fine -- novel -- romantic -- dramatically adventurous -- this , indeed , was worth living for , worth traveling for !
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 8]: We would write home all about it .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 23]: This enthusiasm , this stern thirst for adventure , wilted under the sultry August sun and did not last above one hour .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 18]: One poor little hour -- and then we were ashamed that we had `` gushed '' so .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 15]: The poetry was all in the anticipation -- there is none in the reality .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 131]: Imagine a vast , waveless ocean stricken dead and turned to ashes ; imagine this solemn waste tufted with ash-dusted sage-bushes ; imagine the lifeless silence and solitude that belong to such a place ; imagine a coach , creeping like a bug through the midst of this shoreless level , and sending up tumbled volumes of dust as if it were a bug that went by steam ; imagine this aching monotony of toiling and plowing kept up hour after hour , and the shore still as far away as ever , apparently ; imagine team , driver , coach and passengers so deeply coated with ashes that they are all one colorless color ; imagine ash-drifts roosting above moustaches and eyebrows like snow accumulations on boughs and bushes .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 7]: This is the reality of it .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 139]: The sun beats down with dead , blistering , relentless malignity ; the perspiration is welling from every pore in man and beast , but scarcely a sign of it finds its way to the surface -- it is absorbed before it gets there ; there is not the faintest breath of air stirring ; there is not a merciful shred of cloud in all the brilliant firmament ; there is not a living creature visible in any direction whither one searches the blank level that stretches its monotonous miles on every hand ; there is not a sound -- not a sigh -- not a whisper -- not a buzz , or a whir of wings , or distant pipe of bird -- not even a sob from the lost souls that doubtless people that dead air .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 42]: And so the occasional sneezing of the resting mules , and the champing of the bits , grate harshly on the grim stillness , not dissipating the spell but accenting it and making one feel more lonesome and forsaken than before .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 63]: The mules , under violent swearing , coaxing and whip-cracking , would make at stated intervals a `` spurt , '' and drag the coach a hundred or may be two hundred yards , stirring up a billowy cloud of dust that rolled back , enveloping the vehicle to the wheel-tops or higher , and making it seem afloat in a fog .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 12]: Then a rest followed , with the usual sneezing and bit-champing .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 18]: Then another `` spurt '' of a hundred yards and another rest at the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 20]: All day long we kept this up , without water for the mules and without ever changing the team .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 30]: At least we kept it up ten hours , which , I take it , is a day , and a pretty honest one , in an alkali desert .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 13]: It was from four in the morning till two in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 6]: And it was so hot !
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 4]: and so close !
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 18]: and our water canteens went dry in the middle of the day and we got so thirsty !
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 9]: It was so stupid and tiresome and dull !
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 17]: and the tedious hours did lag and drag and limp along with such a cruel deliberation !
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 37]: It was so trying to give one 's watch a good long undisturbed spell and then take it out and find that it had been fooling away the time and not trying to get ahead any !
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 63]: The alkali dust cut through our lips , it persecuted our eyes , it ate through the delicate membranes and made our noses bleed and kept them bleeding -- and truly and seriously the romance all faded far away and disappeared , and left the desert trip nothing but a harsh reality -- a thirsty , sweltering , longing , hateful reality !
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 17]: Two miles and a quarter an hour for ten hours -- that was what we accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 30]: It was hard to bring the comprehension away down to such a snail-pace as that , when we had been used to making eight and ten miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 56]: When we reached the station on the farther verge of the desert , we were glad , for the first time , that the dictionary was along , because we never could have found language to tell how glad we were , in any sort of dictionary but an unabridged one with pictures in it .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 28]: But there could not have been found in a whole library of dictionaries language sufficient to tell how tired those mules were after their twenty-three mile pull .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 27]: To try to give the reader an idea of how thirsty they were , would be to `` gild refined gold or paint the lily . ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 26]: Somehow , now that it is there , the quotation does not seem to fit -- but no matter , let it stay , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 32]: I think it is a graceful and attractive thing , and therefore have tried time and time again to work it in where it would fit , but could not succeed .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 24]: These efforts have kept my mind distracted and ill at ease , and made my narrative seem broken and disjointed , in places .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 45]: Under these circumstances it seems to me best to leave it in , as above , since this will afford at least a temporary respite from the wear and tear of trying to `` lead up '' to this really apt and beautiful quotation .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 29]: On the morning of the sixteenth day out from St. Joseph we arrived at the entrance of Rocky Canyon , two hundred and fifty miles from Salt Lake .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 42]: It was along in this wild country somewhere , and far from any habitation of white men , except the stage stations , that we came across the wretchedest type of mankind I have ever seen , up to this writing .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 7]: I refer to the Goshoot Indians .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 60]: From what we could see and all we could learn , they are very considerably inferior to even the despised Digger Indians of California ; inferior to all races of savages on our continent ; inferior to even the Terra del Fuegans ; inferior to the Hottentots , and actually inferior in some respects to the Kytches of Africa .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 38]: Indeed , I have been obliged to look the bulky volumes of Wood 's `` Uncivilized Races of Men '' clear through in order to find a savage tribe degraded enough to take rank with the Goshoots .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 12]: I find but one people fairly open to that shameful verdict .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 11]: It is the Bosjesmans -LRB- Bushmen -RRB- of South Africa .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 316]: Such of the Goshoots as we saw , along the road and hanging about the stations , were small , lean , `` scrawny '' creatures ; in complexion a dull black like the ordinary American negro ; their faces and hands bearing dirt which they had been hoarding and accumulating for months , years , and even generations , according to the age of the proprietor ; a silent , sneaking , treacherous looking race ; taking note of everything , covertly , like all the other `` Noble Red Men '' that we -LRB- do not -RRB- read about , and betraying no sign in their countenances ; indolent , everlastingly patient and tireless , like all other Indians ; prideless beggars -- for if the beggar instinct were left out of an Indian he would not `` go , '' any more than a clock without a pendulum ; hungry , always hungry , and yet never refusing anything that a hog would eat , though often eating what a hog would decline ; hunters , but having no higher ambition than to kill and eat jack-ass rabbits , crickets and grasshoppers , and embezzle carrion from the buzzards and cayotes ; savages who , when asked if they have the common Indian belief in a Great Spirit show a something which almost amounts to emotion , thinking whiskey is referred to ; a thin , scattering race of almost naked black children , these Goshoots are , who produce nothing at all , and have no villages , and no gatherings together into strictly defined tribal communities -- a people whose only shelter is a rag cast on a bush to keep off a portion of the snow , and yet who inhabit one of the most rocky , wintry , repulsive wastes that our country or any other can exhibit .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 30]: The Bushmen and our Goshoots are manifestly descended from the self-same gorilla , or kangaroo , or Norway rat , which-ever animal -- Adam the Darwinians trace them to .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 58]: One would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the Goshoots , and yet they used to live off the offal and refuse of the stations a few months and then come some dark night when no mischief was expected , and burn down the buildings and kill the men from ambush as they rushed out .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 56]: And once , in the night , they attacked the stage-coach when a District Judge , of Nevada Territory , was the only passenger , and with their first volley of arrows -LRB- and a bullet or two -RRB- they riddled the stage curtains , wounded a horse or two and mortally wounded the driver .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 13]: The latter was full of pluck , and so was his passenger .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 42]: At the driver 's call Judge Mott swung himself out , clambered to the box and seized the reins of the team , and away they plunged , through the racing mob of skeletons and under a hurtling storm of missiles .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 36]: The stricken driver had sunk down on the boot as soon as he was wounded , but had held on to the reins and said he would manage to keep hold of them until relieved .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 93]: And after they were taken from his relaxing grasp , he lay with his head between Judge Mott 's feet , and tranquilly gave directions about the road ; he said he believed he could live till the miscreants were outrun and left behind , and that if he managed that , the main difficulty would be at an end , and then if the Judge drove so and so -LRB- giving directions about bad places in the road , and general course -RRB- he would reach the next station without trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 41]: The Judge distanced the enemy and at last rattled up to the station and knew that the night 's perils were done ; but there was no comrade-in-arms for him to rejoice with , for the soldierly driver was dead .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 17]: Let us forget that we have been saying harsh things about the Overland drivers , now .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 146]: The disgust which the Goshoots gave me , a disciple of Cooper and a worshipper of the Red Man -- even of the scholarly savages in the `` Last of the Mohicans '' who are fittingly associated with backwoodsmen who divide each sentence into two equal parts : one part critically grammatical , refined and choice of language , and the other part just such an attempt to talk like a hunter or a mountaineer , as a Broadway clerk might make after eating an edition of Emerson Bennett 's works and studying frontier life at the Bowery Theatre a couple of weeks -- I say that the nausea which the Goshoots gave me , an Indian worshipper , set me to examining authorities , to see if perchance I had been over-estimating the Red Man while viewing him through the mellow moonshine of romance .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 7]: The revelations that came were disenchanting .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 57]: It was curious to see how quickly the paint and tinsel fell away from him and left him treacherous , filthy and repulsive -- and how quickly the evidences accumulated that wherever one finds an Indian tribe he has only found Goshoots more or less modified by circumstances and surroundings -- but Goshoots , after all .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 17]: They deserve pity , poor creatures ; and they can have mine -- at this distance .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 9]: Nearer by , they never get anybody 's .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 26]: There is an impression abroad that the Baltimore and Washington Railroad Company and many of its employees are Goshoots ; but it is an error .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 29]: There is only a plausible resemblance , which , while it is apt enough to mislead the ignorant , can not deceive parties who have contemplated both tribes .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 61]: But seriously , it was not only poor wit , but very wrong to start the report referred to above ; for however innocent the motive may have been , the necessary effect was to injure the reputation of a class who have a hard enough time of it in the pitiless deserts of the Rocky Mountains , Heaven knows !
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 35]: If we can not find it in our hearts to give those poor naked creatures our Christian sympathy and compassion , in God 's name let us at least not throw mud at them .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 39]: On the seventeenth day we passed the highest mountain peaks we had yet seen , and although the day was very warm the night that followed upon its heels was wintry cold and blankets were next to useless .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 34]: On the eighteenth day we encountered the eastward-bound telegraph-constructors at Reese River station and sent a message to his Excellency Gov. Nye at Carson City -LRB- distant one hundred and fifty-six miles -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 31]: On the nineteenth day we crossed the Great American Desert -- forty memorable miles of bottomless sand , into which the coach wheels sunk from six inches to a foot .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 10]: We worked our passage most of the way across .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 11]: That is to say , we got out and walked .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 18]: It was a dreary pull and a long and thirsty one , for we had no water .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 22]: From one extremity of this desert to the other , the road was white with the bones of oxen and horses .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 27]: It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that we could have walked the forty miles and set our feet on a bone at every step !
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 7]: The desert was one prodigious graveyard .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 20]: And the log-chains , wagon tyres , and rotting wrecks of vehicles were almost as thick as the bones .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 21]: I think we saw log-chains enough rusting there in the desert , to reach across any State in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 22]: Do not these relics suggest something of an idea of the fearful suffering and privation the early emigrants to California endured ?
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 35]: At the border of the Desert lies Carson Lake , or The `` Sink '' of the Carson , a shallow , melancholy sheet of water some eighty or a hundred miles in circumference .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 33]: Carson River empties into it and is lost -- sinks mysteriously into the earth and never appears in the light of the sun again -- for the lake has no outlet whatever .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 15]: There are several rivers in Nevada , and they all have this mysterious fate .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 18]: They end in various lakes or `` sinks , '' and that is the last of them .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 23]: Carson Lake , Humboldt Lake , Walker Lake , Mono Lake , are all great sheets of water without any visible outlet .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 30]: Water is always flowing into them ; none is ever seen to flow out of them , and yet they remain always level full , neither receding nor overflowing .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 13]: What they do with their surplus is only known to the Creator .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 14]: On the western verge of the Desert we halted a moment at Ragtown .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 15]: It consisted of one log house and is not set down on the map .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 7]: This reminds me of a circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 41]: Just after we left Julesburg , on the Platte , I was sitting with the driver , and he said : `` I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed , if you would like to listen to it .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 8]: Horace Greeley went over this road once .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 32]: When he was leaving Carson City he told the driver , Hank Monk , that he had an engagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through quick .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 13]: Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 66]: The coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the buttons all off of Horace 's coat , and finally shot his head clean through the roof of the stage , and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to go easier -- said he war n't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 38]: But Hank Monk said , ` Keep your seat , Horace , and I 'll get you there on time ' -- and you bet you he did , too , what was left of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 32]: A day or two after that we picked up a Denver man at the cross roads , and he told us a good deal about the country and the Gregory Diggings .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 17]: He seemed a very entertaining person and a man well posted in the affairs of Colorado .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 26]: By and by he remarked : `` I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed , if you would like to listen to it .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 8]: Horace Greeley went over this road once .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 32]: When he was leaving Carson City he told the driver , Hank Monk , that he had an engagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through quick .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 13]: Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 66]: The coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the buttons all off of Horace 's coat , and finally shot his head clean through the roof of the stage , and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to go easier -- said he war n't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 22]: But Hank Monk said , ` Keep your seat , Horace , and I 'll get you there on time ! '
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 17]: -- and you bet you he did , too , what was left of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 25]: At Fort Bridger , some days after this , we took on board a cavalry sergeant , a very proper and soldierly person indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 22]: From no other man during the whole journey , did we gather such a store of concise and well-arranged military information .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 38]: It was surprising to find in the desolate wilds of our country a man so thoroughly acquainted with everything useful to know in his line of life , and yet of such inferior rank and unpretentious bearing .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 14]: For as much as three hours we listened to him with unabated interest .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 34]: Finally he got upon the subject of trans-continental travel , and presently said : `` I can tell you a very laughable thing indeed , if you would like to listen to it .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 8]: Horace Greeley went over this road once .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 32]: When he was leaving Carson City he told the driver , Hank Monk , that he had an engagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through quick .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 13]: Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 66]: The coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the buttons all off of Horace 's coat , and finally shot his head clean through the roof of the stage , and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to go easier -- said he war n't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 22]: But Hank Monk said , ` Keep your seat , Horace , and I 'll get you there on time ! '
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 17]: -- and you bet you he did , too , what was left of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 42]: When we were eight hours out from Salt Lake City a Mormon preacher got in with us at a way station -- a gentle , soft-spoken , kindly man , and one whom any stranger would warm to at first sight .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 30]: I can never forget the pathos that was in his voice as he told , in simple language , the story of his people 's wanderings and unpitied sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 46]: No pulpit eloquence was ever so moving and so beautiful as this outcast 's picture of the first Mormon pilgrimage across the plains , struggling sorrowfully onward to the land of its banishment and marking its desolate way with graves and watering it with tears .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 38]: His words so wrought upon us that it was a relief to us all when the conversation drifted into a more cheerful channel and the natural features of the curious country we were in came under treatment .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 35]: One matter after another was pleasantly discussed , and at length the stranger said : `` I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed , if you would like to listen to it .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 8]: Horace Greeley went over this road once .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 33]: When he was leaving Carson City he told the driver , Hank Monk , that he had an engagement to lecture in Placerville , and was very anxious to go through quick .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 13]: Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 66]: The coach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the buttons all off of Horace 's coat , and finally shot his head clean through the roof of the stage , and then he yelled at Hank Monk and begged him to go easier -- said he war n't in as much of a hurry as he was awhile ago .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 22]: But Hank Monk said , ` Keep your seat , Horace , and I 'll get you there on time ! '
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 19]: -- and you bet you bet you he did , too , what was left of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 17]: Ten miles out of Ragtown we found a poor wanderer who had lain down to die .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 18]: He had walked as long as he could , but his limbs had failed him at last .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 7]: Hunger and fatigue had conquered him .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 10]: It would have been inhuman to leave him there .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 13]: We paid his fare to Carson and lifted him into the coach .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 36]: It was some little time before he showed any very decided signs of life ; but by dint of chafing him and pouring brandy between his lips we finally brought him to a languid consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 25]: Then we fed him a little , and by and by he seemed to comprehend the situation and a grateful light softened his eye .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 20]: We made his mail-sack bed as comfortable as possible , and constructed a pillow for him with our coats .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 5]: He seemed very thankful .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 70]: Then he looked up in our faces , and said in a feeble voice that had a tremble of honest emotion in it : `` Gentlemen , I know not who you are , but you have saved my life ; and although I can never be able to repay you for it , I feel that I can at least make one hour of your long journey lighter .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 20]: I take it you are strangers to this great thorough fare , but I am entirely familiar with it .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 22]: In this connection I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed , if you would like to listen to it .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 18]: Horace Greeley -- '' I said , impressively : `` Suffering stranger , proceed at your peril .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 15]: You see in me the melancholy wreck of a once stalwart and magnificent manhood .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 7]: What has brought me to this ?
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 9]: That thing which you are about to tell .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 21]: Gradually but surely , that tiresome old anecdote has sapped my strength , undermined my constitution , withered my life .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 4]: Pity my helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 23]: Spare me only just this once , and tell me about young George Washington and his little hatchet for a change . ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 4]: We were saved .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 6]: But not so the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 18]: In trying to retain the anecdote in his system he strained himself and died in our arms .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 70]: I am aware , now , that I ought not to have asked of the sturdiest citizen of all that region , what I asked of that mere shadow of a man ; for , after seven years ' residence on the Pacific coast , I know that no passenger or driver on the Overland ever corked that anecdote in , when a stranger was by , and survived .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 34]: Within a period of six years I crossed and recrossed the Sierras between Nevada and California thirteen times by stage and listened to that deathless incident four hundred and eighty-one or eighty-two times .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 6]: I have the list somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 27]: Drivers always told it , conductors told it , landlords told it , chance passengers told it , the very Chinamen and vagrant Indians recounted it .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 19]: I have had the same driver tell it to me two or three times in the same afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 63]: It has come to me in all the multitude of tongues that Babel bequeathed to earth , and flavored with whiskey , brandy , beer , cologne , sozodont , tobacco , garlic , onions , grasshoppers -- everything that has a fragrance to it through all the long list of things that are gorged or guzzled by the sons of men .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 28]: I never have smelt any anecdote as often as I have smelt that one ; never have smelt any anecdote that smelt so variegated as that one .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 34]: And you never could learn to know it by its smell , because every time you thought you had learned the smell of it , it would turn up with a different smell .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 58]: Bayard Taylor has written about this hoary anecdote , Richardson has published it ; so have Jones , Smith , Johnson , Ross Browne , and every other correspondence-inditing being that ever set his foot upon the great overland road anywhere between Julesburg and San Francisco ; and I have heard that it is in the Talmud .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 42]: I have seen it in print in nine different foreign languages ; I have been told that it is employed in the inquisition in Rome ; and I now learn with regret that it is going to be set to music .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 10]: I do not think that such things are right .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 16]: Stage-coaching on the Overland is no more , and stage drivers are a race defunct .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 69]: I wonder if they bequeathed that bald-headed anecdote to their successors , the railroad brakemen and conductors , and if these latter still persecute the helpless passenger with it until he concludes , as did many a tourist of other days , that the real grandeurs of the Pacific coast are not Yo Semite and the Big Trees , but Hank Monk and his adventure with Horace Greeley .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 21]: -LSB- And what makes that worn anecdote the more aggravating , is , that the adventure it celebrates never occurred .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 43]: If it were a good anecdote , that seeming demerit would be its chiefest virtue , for creative power belongs to greatness ; but what ought to be done to a man who would wantonly contrive so flat a one as this ?
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 29]: If I were to suggest what ought to be done to him , I should be called extravagant -- but what does the sixteenth chapter of Daniel say ?
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 3]: Aha ! -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 10]: We were approaching the end of our long journey .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 9]: It was the morning of the twentieth day .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 14]: At noon we would reach Carson City , the capital of Nevada Territory .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 8]: We were not glad , but sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 60]: It had been a fine pleasure trip ; we had fed fat on wonders every day ; we were now well accustomed to stage life , and very fond of it ; so the idea of coming to a stand-still and settling down to a humdrum existence in a village was not agreeable , but on the contrary depressing .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 16]: Visibly our new home was a desert , walled in by barren , snow-clad mountains .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 8]: There was not a tree in sight .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 11]: There was no vegetation but the endless sage-brush and greasewood .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 7]: All nature was gray with it .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 27]: We were plowing through great deeps of powdery alkali dust that rose in thick clouds and floated across the plain like smoke from a burning house .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 36]: We were coated with it like millers ; so were the coach , the mules , the mail-bags , the driver -- we and the sage-brush and the other scenery were all one monotonous color .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 21]: Long trains of freight wagons in the distance envelope in ascending masses of dust suggested pictures of prairies on fire .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 12]: These teams and their masters were the only life we saw .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 13]: Otherwise we moved in the midst of solitude , silence and desolation .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 25]: Every twenty steps we passed the skeleton of some dead beast of burthen , with its dust-coated skin stretched tightly over its empty ribs .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 20]: Frequently a solemn raven sat upon the skull or the hips and contemplated the passing coach with meditative serenity .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 11]: By and by Carson City was pointed out to us .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 52]: It nestled in the edge of a great plain and was a sufficient number of miles away to look like an assemblage of mere white spots in the shadow of a grim range of mountains overlooking it , whose summits seemed lifted clear out of companionship and consciousness of earthly things .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 11]: We arrived , disembarked , and the stage went on .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 14]: It was a `` wooden '' town ; its population two thousand souls .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 39]: The main street consisted of four or five blocks of little white frame stores which were too high to sit down on , but not too high for various other purposes ; in fact , hardly high enough .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 20]: They were packed close together , side by side , as if room were scarce in that mighty plain .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 19]: The sidewalk was of boards that were more or less loose and inclined to rattle when walked upon .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 67]: In the middle of the town , opposite the stores , was the `` plaza '' which is native to all towns beyond the Rocky Mountains -- a large , unfenced , level vacancy , with a liberty pole in it , and very useful as a place for public auctions , horse trades , and mass meetings , and likewise for teamsters to camp in .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 15]: Two other sides of the plaza were faced by stores , offices and stables .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 9]: The rest of Carson City was pretty scattering .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 95]: We were introduced to several citizens , at the stage-office and on the way up to the Governor 's from the hotel -- among others , to a Mr. Harris , who was on horseback ; he began to say something , but interrupted himself with the remark : `` I 'll have to get you to excuse me a minute ; yonder is the witness that swore I helped to rob the California coach -- a piece of impertinent intermeddling , sir , for I am not even acquainted with the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 23]: Then he rode over and began to rebuke the stranger with a six-shooter , and the stranger began to explain with another .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 68]: When the pistols were emptied , the stranger resumed his work -LRB- mending a whip-lash -RRB- , and Mr. Harris rode by with a polite nod , homeward bound , with a bullet through one of his lungs , and several in his hips ; and from them issued little rivulets of blood that coursed down the horse 's sides and made the animal look quite picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 20]: I never saw Harris shoot a man after that but it recalled to mind that first day in Carson .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 56]: This was all we saw that day , for it was two o'clock , now , and according to custom the daily `` Washoe Zephyr '' set in ; a soaring dust-drift about the size of the United States set up edgewise came with it , and the capital of Nevada Territory disappeared from view .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 140]: Still , there were sights to be seen which were not wholly uninteresting to new comers ; for the vast dust cloud was thickly freckled with things strange to the upper air -- things living and dead , that flitted hither and thither , going and coming , appearing and disappearing among the rolling billows of dust -- hats , chickens and parasols sailing in the remote heavens ; blankets , tin signs , sage-brush and shingles a shade lower ; door-mats and buffalo robes lower still ; shovels and coal scuttles on the next grade ; glass doors , cats and little children on the next ; disrupted lumber yards , light buggies and wheelbarrows on the next ; and down only thirty or forty feet above ground was a scurrying storm of emigrating roofs and vacant lots .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 8]: It was something to see that much .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 18]: I could have seen more , if I could have kept the dust out of my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 13]: But seriously a Washoe wind is by no means a trifling matter .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 65]: It blows flimsy houses down , lifts shingle roofs occasionally , rolls up tin ones like sheet music , now and then blows a stage coach over and spills the passengers ; and tradition says the reason there are so many bald people there , is , that the wind blows the hair off their heads while they are looking skyward after their hats .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 30]: Carson streets seldom look inactive on Summer afternoons , because there are so many citizens skipping around their escaping hats , like chambermaids trying to head off a spider .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 31]: The `` Washoe Zephyr '' -LRB- Washoe is a pet nickname for Nevada -RRB- is a peculiar Scriptural wind , in that no man knoweth `` whence it cometh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 9]: That is to say , where it originates .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 28]: It comes right over the mountains from the West , but when one crosses the ridge he does not find any of it on the other side !
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 16]: It probably is manufactured on the mountain-top for the occasion , and starts from there .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 12]: It is a pretty regular wind , in the summer time .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 48]: Its office hours are from two in the afternoon till two the next morning ; and anybody venturing abroad during those twelve hours needs to allow for the wind or he will bring up a mile or two to leeward of the point he is aiming at .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 23]: And yet the first complaint a Washoe visitor to San Francisco makes , is that the sea winds blow so , there !
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 11]: There is a good deal of human nature in that .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 50]: We found the state palace of the Governor of Nevada Territory to consist of a white frame one-story house with two small rooms in it and a stanchion supported shed in front -- for grandeur -- it compelled the respect of the citizen and inspired the Indians with awe .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 24]: The newly arrived Chief and Associate Justices of the Territory , and other machinery of the government , were domiciled with less splendor .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 14]: They were boarding around privately , and had their offices in their bedrooms .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 32]: The Secretary and I took quarters in the `` ranch '' of a worthy French lady by the name of Bridget O'Flannigan , a camp follower of his Excellency the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 31]: She had known him in his prosperity as commander-in-chief of the Metropolitan Police of New York , and she would not desert him in his adversity as Governor of Nevada .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 60]: Our room was on the lower floor , facing the plaza , and when we had got our bed , a small table , two chairs , the government fire-proof safe , and the Unabridged Dictionary into it , there was still room enough left for a visitor -- may be two , but not without straining the walls .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 35]: But the walls could stand it -- at least the partitions could , for they consisted simply of one thickness of white `` cotton domestic '' stretched from corner to corner of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 17]: This was the rule in Carson -- any other kind of partition was the rare exception .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 27]: And if you stood in a dark room and your neighbors in the next had lights , the shadows on your canvas told queer secrets sometimes !
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 58]: Very often these partitions were made of old flour sacks basted together ; and then the difference between the common herd and the aristocracy was , that the common herd had unornamented sacks , while the walls of the aristocrat were overpowering with rudimental fresco -- i.e. , red and blue mill brands on the flour sacks .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 20]: Occasionally , also , the better classes embellished their canvas by pasting pictures from Harper 's Weekly on them .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 24]: In many cases , too , the wealthy and the cultured rose to spittoons and other evidences of a sumptuous and luxurious taste .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 40]: -LSB- Washoe people take a joke so hard that I must explain that the above description was only the rule ; there were many honorable exceptions in Carson -- plastered ceilings and houses that had considerable furniture in them .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 17]: -- M. T. -RSB- We had a carpet and a genuine queen 's - ware washbowl .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 17]: Consequently we were hated without reserve by the other tenants of the O'Flannigan `` ranch . ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 19]: When we added a painted oilcloth window curtain , we simply took our lives into our own hands .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 41]: To prevent bloodshed I removed up stairs and took up quarters with the untitled plebeians in one of the fourteen white pine cot-bedsteads that stood in two long ranks in the one sole room of which the second story consisted .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 9]: It was a jolly company , the fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 60]: They were principally voluntary camp-followers of the Governor , who had joined his retinue by their own election at New York and San Francisco and came along , feeling that in the scuffle for little territorial crumbs and offices they could not make their condition more precarious than it was , and might reasonably expect to make it better .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 26]: They were popularly known as the `` Irish Brigade , '' though there were only four or five Irishmen among all the Governor 's retainers .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 38]: His good-natured Excellency was much annoyed at the gossip his henchmen created -- especially when there arose a rumor that they were paid assassins of his , brought along to quietly reduce the democratic vote when desirable !
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 24]: Mrs. O'Flannigan was boarding and lodging them at ten dollars a week apiece , and they were cheerfully giving their notes for it .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 26]: They were perfectly satisfied , but Bridget presently found that notes that could not be discounted were but a feeble constitution for a Carson boarding-house .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 16]: So she began to harry the Governor to find employment for the `` Brigade . ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 24]: Her importunities and theirs together drove him to a gentle desperation at last , and he finally summoned the Brigade to the presence .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 46]: Then , said he : `` Gentlemen , I have planned a lucrative and useful service for you -- a service which will provide you with recreation amid noble landscapes , and afford you never ceasing opportunities for enriching your minds by observation and study .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 16]: I want you to survey a railroad from Carson City westward to a certain point !
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 17]: When the legislature meets I will have the necessary bill passed and the remuneration arranged . ''
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 12]: `` What , a railroad over the Sierra Nevada Mountains ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 14]: `` Well , then , survey it eastward to a certain point ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 19]: He converted them into surveyors , chain-bearers and so on , and turned them loose in the desert .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 9]: It was `` recreation '' with a vengeance !
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 24]: Recreation on foot , lugging chains through sand and sage-brush , under a sultry sun and among cattle bones , cayotes and tarantulas .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 9]: `` Romantic adventure '' could go no further .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 11]: They surveyed very slowly , very deliberately , very carefully .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 22]: They returned every night during the first week , dusty , footsore , tired , and hungry , but very jolly .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 26]: They brought in great store of prodigious hairy spiders -- tarantulas -- and imprisoned them in covered tumblers up stairs in the `` ranch . ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 20]: After the first week , they had to camp on the field , for they were getting well eastward .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 23]: They made a good many inquiries as to the location of that indefinite `` certain point , '' but got no information .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 15]: At last , to a peculiarly urgent inquiry of `` How far eastward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 14]: Governor Nye telegraphed back : `` To the Atlantic Ocean , blast you !
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 10]: -- and then bridge it and go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 18]: This brought back the dusty toilers , who sent in a report and ceased from their labors .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 63]: The Governor was always comfortable about it ; he said Mrs. O'Flannigan would hold him for the Brigade 's board anyhow , and he intended to get what entertainment he could out of the boys ; he said , with his old-time pleasant twinkle , that he meant to survey them into Utah and then telegraph Brigham to hang them for trespass !
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 24]: The surveyors brought back more tarantulas with them , and so we had quite a menagerie arranged along the shelves of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 40]: Some of these spiders could straddle over a common saucer with their hairy , muscular legs , and when their feelings were hurt , or their dignity offended , they were the wickedest-looking desperadoes the animal world can furnish .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 21]: If their glass prison-houses were touched ever so lightly they were up and spoiling for a fight in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 2]: Starchy ?
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 3]: -- proud ?
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 18]: Indeed , they would take up a straw and pick their teeth like a member of Congress .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 45]: There was as usual a furious `` zephyr '' blowing the first night of the brigade 's return , and about midnight the roof of an adjoining stable blew off , and a corner of it came crashing through the side of our ranch .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 34]: There was a simultaneous awakening , and a tumultuous muster of the brigade in the dark , and a general tumbling and sprawling over each other in the narrow aisle between the bedrows .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 27]: In the midst of the turmoil , Bob H -- sprung up out of a sound sleep , and knocked down a shelf with his head .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 16]: Instantly he shouted : `` Turn out , boys -- the tarantulas is loose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 7]: No warning ever sounded so dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 19]: Nobody tried , any longer , to leave the room , lest he might step on a tarantula .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 15]: Every man groped for a trunk or a bed , and jumped on it .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 22]: Then followed the strangest silence -- a silence of grisly suspense it was , too -- waiting , expectancy , fear .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 34]: It was as dark as pitch , and one had to imagine the spectacle of those fourteen scant-clad men roosting gingerly on trunks and beds , for not a thing could be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 39]: Then came occasional little interruptions of the silence , and one could recognize a man and tell his locality by his voice , or locate any other sound a sufferer made by his gropings or changes of position .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 21]: The occasional voices were not given to much speaking -- you simply heard a gentle ejaculation of `` Ow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 32]: followed by a solid thump , and you knew the gentleman had felt a hairy blanket or something touch his bare skin and had skipped from a bed to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 3]: Another silence .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 25]: Presently you would hear a gasping voice say : `` Su -- su -- something 's crawling up the back of my neck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 19]: Every now and then you could hear a little subdued scramble and a sorrowful `` O Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 27]: and then you knew that somebody was getting away from something he took for a tarantula , and not losing any time about it , either .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 18]: Directly a voice in the corner rang out wild and clear : `` I 've got him !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 6]: I 've got him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 10]: -LSB- Pause , and probable change of circumstances . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 8]: `` No , he 's got me !
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 13]: Oh , ai n't they never going to fetch a lantern ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 64]: The lantern came at that moment , in the hands of Mrs. O'Flannigan , whose anxiety to know the amount of damage done by the assaulting roof had not prevented her waiting a judicious interval , after getting out of bed and lighting up , to see if the wind was done , now , up stairs , or had a larger contract .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 28]: The landscape presented when the lantern flashed into the room was picturesque , and might have been funny to some people , but was not to us .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 48]: Although we were perched so strangely upon boxes , trunks and beds , and so strangely attired , too , we were too earnestly distressed and too genuinely miserable to see any fun about it , and there was not the semblance of a smile anywhere visible .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 30]: I know I am not capable of suffering more than I did during those few minutes of suspense in the dark , surrounded by those creeping , bloody-minded tarantulas .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 33]: I had skipped from bed to bed and from box to box in a cold agony , and every time I touched anything that was furzy I fancied I felt the fangs .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 13]: I had rather go to war than live that episode over again .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 4]: Nobody was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 25]: The man who thought a tarantula had `` got him '' was mistaken -- only a crack in a box had caught his finger .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 11]: Not one of those escaped tarantulas was ever seen again .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 8]: There were ten or twelve of them .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 18]: We took candles and hunted the place high and low for them , but with no success .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 8]: Did we go back to bed then ?
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 7]: We did nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 10]: Money could not have persuaded us to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 19]: We sat up the rest of the night playing cribbage and keeping a sharp lookout for the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 17]: It was the end of August , and the skies were cloudless and the weather superb .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 29]: In two or three weeks I had grown wonderfully fascinated with the curious new country and concluded to put off my return to `` the States '' awhile .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 34]: I had grown well accustomed to wearing a damaged slouch hat , blue woolen shirt , and pants crammed into boot-tops , and gloried in the absence of coat , vest and braces .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 28]: I felt rowdyish and `` bully , '' -LRB- as the historian Josephus phrases it , in his fine chapter upon the destruction of the Temple -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 14]: It seemed to me that nothing could be so fine and so romantic .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 16]: I had become an officer of the government , but that was for mere sublimity .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 7]: The office was an unique sinecure .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 9]: I had nothing to do and no salary .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 21]: I was private Secretary to his majesty the Secretary and there was not yet writing enough for two of us .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 12]: So Johnny K -- and I devoted our time to amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 16]: He was the young son of an Ohio nabob and was out there for recreation .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 4]: He got it .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 25]: We had heard a world of talk about the marvellous beauty of Lake Tahoe , and finally curiosity drove us thither to see it .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 29]: Three or four members of the Brigade had been there and located some timber lands on its shores and stored up a quantity of provisions in their camp .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 33]: We strapped a couple of blankets on our shoulders and took an axe apiece and started -- for we intended to take up a wood ranch or so ourselves and become wealthy .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 5]: We were on foot .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 10]: The reader will find it advantageous to go horseback .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 10]: We were told that the distance was eleven miles .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 25]: We tramped a long time on level ground , and then toiled laboriously up a mountain about a thousand miles high and looked over .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 4]: No lake there .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 29]: We descended on the other side , crossed the valley and toiled up another mountain three or four thousand miles high , apparently , and looked over again .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 4]: No lake yet .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 22]: We sat down tired and perspiring , and hired a couple of Chinamen to curse those people who had beguiled us .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 14]: Thus refreshed , we presently resumed the march with renewed vigor and determination .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 58]: We plodded on , two or three hours longer , and at last the Lake burst upon us -- a noble sheet of blue water lifted six thousand three hundred feet above the level of the sea , and walled in by a rim of snow-clad mountain peaks that towered aloft full three thousand feet higher still !
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 24]: It was a vast oval , and one would have to use up eighty or a hundred good miles in traveling around it .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 30]: As it lay there with the shadows of the mountains brilliantly photographed upon its still surface I thought it must surely be the fairest picture the whole earth affords .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 36]: We found the small skiff belonging to the Brigade boys , and without loss of time set out across a deep bend of the lake toward the landmarks that signified the locality of the camp .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 28]: I got Johnny to row -- not because I mind exertion myself , but because it makes me sick to ride backwards when I am at work .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 4]: But I steered .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 24]: A three-mile pull brought us to the camp just as the night fell , and we stepped ashore very tired and wolfishly hungry .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 42]: In a `` cache '' among the rocks we found the provisions and the cooking utensils , and then , all fatigued as I was , I sat down on a boulder and superintended while Johnny gathered wood and cooked supper .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 17]: Many a man who had gone through what I had , would have wanted to rest .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 16]: It was a delicious supper -- hot bread , fried bacon , and black coffee .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 11]: It was a delicious solitude we were in , too .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 26]: Three miles away was a saw-mill and some workmen , but there were not fifteen other human beings throughout the wide circumference of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 33]: As the darkness closed down and the stars came out and spangled the great mirror with jewels , we smoked meditatively in the solemn hush and forgot our troubles and our pains .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 39]: In due time we spread our blankets in the warm sand between two large boulders and soon feel asleep , careless of the procession of ants that passed in through rents in our clothing and explored our persons .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 37]: Nothing could disturb the sleep that fettered us , for it had been fairly earned , and if our consciences had any sins on them they had to adjourn court for that night , any way .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 26]: The wind rose just as we were losing consciousness , and we were lulled to sleep by the beating of the surf upon the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 24]: It is always very cold on that lake shore in the night , but we had plenty of blankets and were warm enough .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 37]: We never moved a muscle all night , but waked at early dawn in the original positions , and got up at once , thoroughly refreshed , free from soreness , and brim full of friskiness .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 12]: There is no end of wholesome medicine in such an experience .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 22]: That morning we could have whipped ten such people as we were the day before -- sick ones at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 27]: But the world is slow , and people will go to `` water cures '' and `` movement cures '' and to foreign lands for health .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 27]: Three months of camp life on Lake Tahoe would restore an Egyptian mummy to his pristine vigor , and give him an appetite like an alligator .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 18]: I do not mean the oldest and driest mummies , of course , but the fresher ones .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 17]: The air up there in the clouds is very pure and fine , bracing and delicious .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 7]: And why should n't it be ?
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 9]: -- it is the same the angels breathe .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 29]: I think that hardly any amount of fatigue can be gathered together that a man can not sleep off in one night on the sand by its side .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 21]: Not under a roof , but under the sky ; it seldom or never rains there in the summer time .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 10]: I know a man who went there to die .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 8]: But he made a failure of it .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 13]: He was a skeleton when he came , and could barely stand .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 17]: He had no appetite , and did nothing but read tracts and reflect on the future .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 34]: Three months later he was sleeping out of doors regularly , eating all he could hold , three times a day , and chasing game over mountains three thousand feet high for recreation .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 15]: And he was a skeleton no longer , but weighed part of a ton .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 10]: This is no fancy sketch , but the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 5]: His disease was consumption .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: I confidently commend his experience to other skeletons .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 29]: I superintended again , and as soon as we had eaten breakfast we got in the boat and skirted along the lake shore about three miles and disembarked .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 28]: We liked the appearance of the place , and so we claimed some three hundred acres of it and stuck our `` notices '' on a tree .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 27]: It was yellow pine timber land -- a dense forest of trees a hundred feet high and from one to five feet through at the butt .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 14]: It was necessary to fence our property or we could not hold it .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 39]: That is to say , it was necessary to cut down trees here and there and make them fall in such a way as to form a sort of enclosure -LRB- with pretty wide gaps in it -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 69]: We cut down three trees apiece , and found it such heart-breaking work that we decided to `` rest our case '' on those ; if they held the property , well and good ; if they did n't , let the property spill out through the gaps and go ; it was no use to work ourselves to death merely to save a few acres of land .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 24]: Next day we came back to build a house -- for a house was also necessary , in order to hold the property .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 46]: We decided to build a substantial log-house and excite the envy of the Brigade boys ; but by the time we had cut and trimmed the first log it seemed unnecessary to be so elaborate , and so we concluded to build it of saplings .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 37]: However , two saplings , duly cut and trimmed , compelled recognition of the fact that a still modester architecture would satisfy the law , and so we concluded to build a `` brush '' house .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 78]: We devoted the next day to this work , but we did so much `` sitting around '' and discussing , that by the middle of the afternoon we had achieved only a half-way sort of affair which one of us had to watch while the other cut brush , lest if both turned our backs we might not be able to find it again , it had such a strong family resemblance to the surrounding vegetation .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 7]: But we were satisfied with it .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 19]: We were land owners now , duly seized and possessed , and within the protection of the law .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 27]: Therefore we decided to take up our residence on our own domain and enjoy that large sense of independence which only such an experience can bring .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 53]: Late the next afternoon , after a good long rest , we sailed away from the Brigade camp with all the provisions and cooking utensils we could carry off -- borrow is the more accurate word -- and just as the night was falling we beached the boat at our own landing .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 45]: If there is any life that is happier than the life we led on our timber ranch for the next two or three weeks , it must be a sort of life which I have not read of in books or experienced in person .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 46]: We did not see a human being but ourselves during the time , or hear any sounds but those that were made by the wind and the waves , the sighing of the pines , and now and then the far-off thunder of an avalanche .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 82]: The forest about us was dense and cool , the sky above us was cloudless and brilliant with sunshine , the broad lake before us was glassy and clear , or rippled and breezy , or black and storm-tossed , according to Nature 's mood ; and its circling border of mountain domes , clothed with forests , scarred with land-slides , cloven by canons and valleys , and helmeted with glittering snow , fitly framed and finished the noble picture .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 10]: The view was always fascinating , bewitching , entrancing .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 40]: The eye was never tired of gazing , night or day , in calm or storm ; it suffered but one grief , and that was that it could not look always , but must close sometimes in sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 27]: We slept in the sand close to the water 's edge , between two protecting boulders , which took care of the stormy night-winds for us .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 10]: We never took any paregoric to make us sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 25]: At the first break of dawn we were always up and running foot-races to tone down excess of physical vigor and exuberance of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 12]: That is , Johnny was -- but I held his hat .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 43]: While smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel peaks put on the glory of the sun , and followed the conquering light as it swept down among the shadows , and set the captive crags and forests free .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 35]: We watched the tinted pictures grow and brighten upon the water till every little detail of forest , precipice and pinnacle was wrought in and finished , and the miracle of the enchanter complete .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 6]: Then to `` business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 9]: That is , drifting around in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 7]: We were on the north shore .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 14]: There , the rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray , sometimes white .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 19]: This gives the marvelous transparency of the water a fuller advantage than it has elsewhere on the lake .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 36]: We usually pushed out a hundred yards or so from shore , and then lay down on the thwarts , in the sun , and let the boat drift by the hour whither it would .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 4]: We seldom talked .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 17]: It interrupted the Sabbath stillness , and marred the dreams the luxurious rest and indolence brought .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 55]: The shore all along was indented with deep , curved bays and coves , bordered by narrow sand-beaches ; and where the sand ended , the steep mountain-sides rose right up aloft into space -- rose up like a vast wall a little out of the perpendicular , and thickly wooded with tall pines .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 32]: So singularly clear was the water , that where it was only twenty or thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct that the boat seemed floating in the air !
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 10]: Yes , where it was even eighty feet deep .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 18]: Every little pebble was distinct , every speckled trout , every hand 's - breadth of sand .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 62]: Often , as we lay on our faces , a granite boulder , as large as a village church , would start out of the bottom apparently , and seem climbing up rapidly to the surface , till presently it threatened to touch our faces , and we could not resist the impulse to seize an oar and avert the danger .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 40]: But the boat would float on , and the boulder descend again , and then we could see that when we had been exactly above it , it must still have been twenty or thirty feet below the surface .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 22]: Down through the transparency of these great depths , the water was not merely transparent , but dazzlingly , brilliantly so .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 39]: All objects seen through it had a bright , strong vividness , not only of outline , but of every minute detail , which they would not have had when seen simply through the same depth of atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 33]: So empty and airy did all spaces seem below us , and so strong was the sense of floating high aloft in mid-nothingness , that we called these boat-excursions `` balloon-voyages . ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 16]: We fished a good deal , but we did not average one fish a week .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 39]: We could see trout by the thousand winging about in the emptiness under us , or sleeping in shoals on the bottom , but they would not bite -- they could see the line too plainly , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 45]: We frequently selected the trout we wanted , and rested the bait patiently and persistently on the end of his nose at a depth of eighty feet , but he would only shake it off with an annoyed manner , and shift his position .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 18]: We bathed occasionally , but the water was rather chilly , for all it looked so sunny .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 18]: Sometimes we rowed out to the `` blue water , '' a mile or two from shore .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 15]: It was as dead blue as indigo there , because of the immense depth .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 18]: By official measurement the lake in its centre is one thousand five hundred and twenty-five feet deep !
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 24]: Sometimes , on lazy afternoons , we lolled on the sand in camp , and smoked pipes and read some old well-worn novels .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 51]: At night , by the camp-fire , we played euchre and seven-up to strengthen the mind -- and played them with cards so greasy and defaced that only a whole summer 's acquaintance with them could enable the student to tell the ace of clubs from the jack of diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 9]: We never slept in our `` house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 26]: It never recurred to us , for one thing ; and besides , it was built to hold the ground , and that was enough .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 8]: We did not wish to strain it .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 25]: By and by our provisions began to run short , and we went back to the old camp and laid in a new supply .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 18]: We were gone all day , and reached home again about night-fall , pretty tired and hungry .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 60]: While Johnny was carrying the main bulk of the provisions up to our `` house '' for future use , I took the loaf of bread , some slices of bacon , and the coffee-pot , ashore , set them down by a tree , lit a fire , and went back to the boat to get the frying-pan .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 28]: While I was at this , I heard a shout from Johnny , and looking up I saw that my fire was galloping all over the premises !
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 9]: Johnny was on the other side of it .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 24]: He had to run through the flames to get to the lake shore , and then we stood helpless and watched the devastation .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 21]: The ground was deeply carpeted with dry pine-needles , and the fire touched them off as if they were gunpowder .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 16]: It was wonderful to see with what fierce speed the tall sheet of flame traveled !
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 10]: My coffee-pot was gone , and everything with it .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 35]: In a minute and a half the fire seized upon a dense growth of dry manzanita chapparal six or eight feet high , and then the roaring and popping and crackling was something terrific .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 18]: We were driven to the boat by the intense heat , and there we remained , spell-bound .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 16]: Within half an hour all before us was a tossing , blinding tempest of flame !
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 102]: It went surging up adjacent ridges -- surmounted them and disappeared in the canons beyond -- burst into view upon higher and farther ridges , presently -- shed a grander illumination abroad , and dove again -- flamed out again , directly , higher and still higher up the mountain-side -- threw out skirmishing parties of fire here and there , and sent them trailing their crimson spirals away among remote ramparts and ribs and gorges , till as far as the eye could reach the lofty mountain-fronts were webbed as it were with a tangled network of red lava streams .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 24]: Away across the water the crags and domes were lit with a ruddy glare , and the firmament above was a reflected hell !
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 15]: Every feature of the spectacle was repeated in the glowing mirror of the lake !
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 32]: Both pictures were sublime , both were beautiful ; but that in the lake had a bewildering richness about it that enchanted the eye and held it with the stronger fascination .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 10]: We sat absorbed and motionless through four long hours .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 11]: We never thought of supper , and never felt fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 24]: But at eleven o'clock the conflagration had traveled beyond our range of vision , and then darkness stole down upon the landscape again .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 12]: Hunger asserted itself now , but there was nothing to eat .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 17]: The provisions were all cooked , no doubt , but we did not go to see .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 10]: We were homeless wanderers again , without any property .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 13]: Our fence was gone , our house burned down ; no insurance .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 23]: Our pine forest was well scorched , the dead trees all burned up , and our broad acres of manzanita swept away .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 20]: Our blankets were on our usual sand-bed , however , and so we lay down and went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 34]: The next morning we started back to the old camp , but while out a long way from shore , so great a storm came up that we dared not try to land .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 30]: So I baled out the seas we shipped , and Johnny pulled heavily through the billows till we had reached a point three or four miles beyond the camp .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 56]: The storm was increasing , and it became evident that it was better to take the hazard of beaching the boat than go down in a hundred fathoms of water ; so we ran in , with tall white-caps following , and I sat down in the stern-sheets and pointed her head-on to the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 26]: The instant the bow struck , a wave came over the stern that washed crew and cargo ashore , and saved a deal of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 22]: We shivered in the lee of a boulder all the rest of the day , and froze all the night through .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 21]: In the morning the tempest had gone down , and we paddled down to the camp without any unnecessary delay .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 32]: We were so starved that we ate up the rest of the Brigade 's provisions , and then set out to Carson to tell them about it and ask their forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 9]: It was accorded , upon payment of damages .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 28]: We made many trips to the lake after that , and had many a hair-breadth escape and blood-curdling adventure which will never be recorded in any history .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 9]: I resolved to have a horse to ride .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 31]: I had never seen such wild , free , magnificent horsemanship outside of a circus as these picturesquely-clad Mexicans , Californians and Mexicanized Americans displayed in Carson streets every day .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 4]: How they rode !
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 40]: Leaning just gently forward out of the perpendicular , easy and nonchalant , with broad slouch-hat brim blown square up in front , and long riata swinging above the head , they swept through the town like the wind !
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 16]: The next minute they were only a sailing puff of dust on the far desert .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 34]: If they trotted , they sat up gallantly and gracefully , and seemed part of the horse ; did not go jiggering up and down after the silly Miss-Nancy fashion of the riding-schools .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 21]: I had quickly learned to tell a horse from a cow , and was full of anxiety to learn more .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 8]: I was resolved to buy a horse .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 49]: While the thought was rankling in my mind , the auctioneer came skurrying through the plaza on a black beast that had as many humps and corners on him as a dromedary , and was necessarily uncomely ; but he was `` going , going , at twenty-two !
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 13]: -- horse , saddle and bridle at twenty-two dollars , gentlemen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 6]: and I could hardly resist .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 54]: A man whom I did not know -LRB- he turned out to be the auctioneer 's brother -RRB- noticed the wistful look in my eye , and observed that that was a very remarkable horse to be going at such a price ; and added that the saddle alone was worth the money .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 24]: It was a Spanish saddle , with ponderous ` tapidaros ' , and furnished with the ungainly sole-leather covering with the unspellable name .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 10]: I said I had half a notion to bid .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 35]: Then this keen-eyed person appeared to me to be `` taking my measure '' ; but I dismissed the suspicion when he spoke , for his manner was full of guileless candor and truthfulness .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 13]: Said he : `` I know that horse -- know him well .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 30]: You are a stranger , I take it , and so you might think he was an American horse , maybe , but I assure you he is not .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 38]: He is nothing of the kind ; but -- excuse my speaking in a low voice , other people being near -- he is , without the shadow of a doubt , a Genuine Mexican Plug ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 41]: I did not know what a Genuine Mexican Plug was , but there was something about this man 's way of saying it , that made me swear inwardly that I would own a Genuine Mexican Plug , or die .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 11]: `` Has he any other -- er -- advantages ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 9]: I inquired , suppressing what eagerness I could .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 35]: He hooked his forefinger in the pocket of my army-shirt , led me to one side , and breathed in my ear impressively these words : `` He can out-buck anything in America ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 25]: `` Going , going , going -- at twent -- ty -- four dollars and a half , gen -- '' `` Twenty-seven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 7]: I shouted , in a frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 5]: `` And sold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 14]: said the auctioneer , and passed over the Genuine Mexican Plug to me .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 7]: I could scarcely contain my exultation .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 19]: I paid the money , and put the animal in a neighboring livery-stable to dine and rest himself .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 31]: In the afternoon I brought the creature into the plaza , and certain citizens held him by the head , and others by the tail , while I mounted him .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 43]: As soon as they let go , he placed all his feet in a bunch together , lowered his back , and then suddenly arched it upward , and shot me straight into the air a matter of three or four feet !
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 48]: I came as straight down again , lit in the saddle , went instantly up again , came down almost on the high pommel , shot up again , and came down on the horse 's neck -- all in the space of three or four seconds .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 31]: Then he rose and stood almost straight up on his hind feet , and I , clasping his lean neck desperately , slid back into the saddle and held on .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 27]: He came down , and immediately hoisted his heels into the air , delivering a vicious kick at the sky , and stood on his forefeet .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 20]: And then down he came once more , and began the original exercise of shooting me straight up again .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 23]: The third time I went up I heard a stranger say : `` Oh , do n't he buck , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 30]: While I was up , somebody struck the horse a sounding thwack with a leathern strap , and when I arrived again the Genuine Mexican Plug was not there .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 19]: A California youth chased him up and caught him , and asked if he might have a ride .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 6]: I granted him that luxury .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 30]: He mounted the Genuine , got lifted into the air once , but sent his spurs home as he descended , and the horse darted away like a telegram .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 19]: He soared over three fences like a bird , and disappeared down the road toward the Washoe Valley .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 33]: I sat down on a stone , with a sigh , and by a natural impulse one of my hands sought my forehead , and the other the base of my stomach .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 28]: I believe I never appreciated , till then , the poverty of the human machinery -- for I still needed a hand or two to place elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 10]: Pen can not describe how I was jolted up .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 24]: Imagination can not conceive how disjointed I was -- how internally , externally and universally I was unsettled , mixed up and ruptured .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 10]: There was a sympathetic crowd around me , though .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 14]: One elderly-looking comforter said : `` Stranger , you 've been taken in .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 8]: Everybody in this camp knows that horse .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 29]: Any child , any Injun , could have told you that he 'd buck ; he is the very worst devil to buck on the continent of America .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 4]: You hear me .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 4]: I 'm Curry .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 3]: Old Curry .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 4]: Old Abe Curry .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 27]: And moreover , he is a simon-pure , out-and-out , genuine d -- d Mexican plug , and an uncommon mean one at that , too .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 37]: Why , you turnip , if you had laid low and kept dark , there 's chances to buy an American horse for mighty little more than you paid for that bloody old foreign relic . ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 37]: I gave no sign ; but I made up my mind that if the auctioneer 's brother 's funeral took place while I was in the Territory I would postpone all other recreations and attend it .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 54]: After a gallop of sixteen miles the Californian youth and the Genuine Mexican Plug came tearing into town again , shedding foam-flakes like the spume-spray that drives before a typhoon , and , with one final skip over a wheelbarrow and a Chinaman , cast anchor in front of the `` ranch . ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 5]: Such panting and blowing !
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 18]: Such spreading and contracting of the red equine nostrils , and glaring of the wild equine eye !
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 7]: But was the imperial beast subjugated ?
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 5]: Indeed he was not .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 61]: His lordship the Speaker of the House thought he was , and mounted him to go down to the Capitol ; but the first dash the creature made was over a pile of telegraph poles half as high as a church ; and his time to the Capitol -- one mile and three quarters -- remains unbeaten to this day .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 20]: But then he took an advantage -- he left out the mile , and only did the three quarters .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 53]: That is to say , he made a straight cut across lots , preferring fences and ditches to a crooked road ; and when the Speaker got to the Capitol he said he had been in the air so much he felt as if he had made the trip on a comet .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 22]: In the evening the Speaker came home afoot for exercise , and got the Genuine towed back behind a quartz wagon .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 38]: The next day I loaned the animal to the Clerk of the House to go down to the Dana silver mine , six miles , and he walked back for exercise , and got the horse towed .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 19]: Everybody I loaned him to always walked back ; they never could get enough exercise any other way .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 44]: Still , I continued to loan him to anybody who was willing to borrow him , my idea being to get him crippled , and throw him on the borrower 's hands , or killed , and make the borrower pay for him .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 8]: But somehow nothing ever happened to him .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 19]: He took chances that no other horse ever took and survived , but he always came out safe .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 22]: It was his daily habit to try experiments that had always before been considered impossible , but he always got through .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 22]: Sometimes he miscalculated a little , and did not get his rider through intact , but he always got through himself .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 22]: Of course I had tried to sell him ; but that was a stretch of simplicity which met with little sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 48]: The auctioneer stormed up and down the streets on him for four days , dispersing the populace , interrupting business , and destroying children , and never got a bid -- at least never any but the eighteen-dollar one he hired a notoriously substanceless bummer to make .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 18]: The people only smiled pleasantly , and restrained their desire to buy , if they had any .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 17]: Then the auctioneer brought in his bill , and I withdrew the horse from the market .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 31]: We tried to trade him off at private vendue next , offering him at a sacrifice for second-hand tombstones , old iron , temperance tracts -- any kind of property .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 13]: But holders were stiff , and we retired from the market again .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 10]: I never tried to ride the horse any more .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 28]: Walking was good enough exercise for a man like me , that had nothing the matter with him except ruptures , internal injuries , and such things .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 8]: Finally I tried to give him away .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 6]: But it was a failure .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 19]: Parties said earthquakes were handy enough on the Pacific coast -- they did not wish to own one .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 19]: As a last resort I offered him to the Governor for the use of the `` Brigade . ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 23]: His face lit up eagerly at first , but toned down again , and he said the thing would be too palpable .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 34]: Just then the livery stable man brought in his bill for six weeks ' keeping -- stall-room for the horse , fifteen dollars ; hay for the horse , two hundred and fifty !
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 28]: The Genuine Mexican Plug had eaten a ton of the article , and the man said he would have eaten a hundred if he had let him .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 34]: I will remark here , in all seriousness , that the regular price of hay during that year and a part of the next was really two hundred and fifty dollars a ton .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 48]: During a part of the previous year it had sold at five hundred a ton , in gold , and during the winter before that there was such scarcity of the article that in several instances small quantities had brought eight hundred dollars a ton in coin !
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 35]: The consequence might be guessed without my telling it : peopled turned their stock loose to starve , and before the spring arrived Carson and Eagle valleys were almost literally carpeted with their carcases !
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 9]: Any old settler there will verify these statements .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 30]: I managed to pay the livery bill , and that same day I gave the Genuine Mexican Plug to a passing Arkansas emigrant whom fortune delivered into my hand .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 14]: If this ever meets his eye , he will doubtless remember the donation .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 44]: Now whoever has had the luck to ride a real Mexican plug will recognize the animal depicted in this chapter , and hardly consider him exaggerated -- but the uninitiated will feel justified in regarding his portrait as a fancy sketch , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 24]: Originally , Nevada was a part of Utah and was called Carson county ; and a pretty large county it was , too .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 23]: Certain of its valleys produced no end of hay , and this attracted small colonies of Mormon stock-raisers and farmers to them .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 21]: A few orthodox Americans straggled in from California , but no love was lost between the two classes of colonists .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 14]: There was little or no friendly intercourse ; each party staid to itself .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 27]: The Mormons were largely in the majority , and had the additional advantage of being peculiarly under the protection of the Mormon government of the Territory .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 15]: Therefore they could afford to be distant , and even peremptory toward their neighbors .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 21]: One of the traditions of Carson Valley illustrates the condition of things that prevailed at the time I speak of .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 41]: The hired girl of one of the American families was Irish , and a Catholic ; yet it was noted with surprise that she was the only person outside of the Mormon ring who could get favors from the Mormons .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 12]: She asked kindnesses of them often , and always got them .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 7]: It was a mystery to everybody .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 47]: But one day as she was passing out at the door , a large bowie knife dropped from under her apron , and when her mistress asked for an explanation she observed that she was going out to `` borry a wash-tub from the Mormons ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 20]: In 1858 silver lodes were discovered in `` Carson County , '' and then the aspect of things changed .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 16]: Californians began to flock in , and the American element was soon in the majority .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 24]: Allegiance to Brigham Young and Utah was renounced , and a temporary territorial government for `` Washoe '' was instituted by the citizens .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 12]: Governor Roop was the first and only chief magistrate of it .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 27]: In due course of time Congress passed a bill to organize `` Nevada Territory , '' and President Lincoln sent out Governor Nye to supplant Roop .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 19]: At this time the population of the Territory was about twelve or fifteen thousand , and rapidly increasing .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 11]: Silver mines were being vigorously developed and silver mills erected .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 16]: Business of all kinds was active and prosperous and growing more so day by day .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 34]: The people were glad to have a legitimately constituted government , but did not particularly enjoy having strangers from distant States put in authority over them -- a sentiment that was natural enough .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 44]: They thought the officials should have been chosen from among themselves from among prominent citizens who had earned a right to such promotion , and who would be in sympathy with the populace and likewise thoroughly acquainted with the needs of the Territory .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 12]: They were right in viewing the matter thus , without doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 21]: The new officers were `` emigrants , '' and that was no title to anybody 's affection or admiration either .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 9]: The new government was received with considerable coolness .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 13]: It was not only a foreign intruder , but a poor one .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 18]: It was not even worth plucking -- except by the smallest of small fry office-seekers and such .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 29]: Everybody knew that Congress had appropriated only twenty thousand dollars a year in greenbacks for its support -- about money enough to run a quartz mill a month .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 32]: And everybody knew , also , that the first year 's money was still in Washington , and that the getting hold of it would be a tedious and difficult process .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 24]: Carson City was too wary and too wise to open up a credit account with the imported bantling with anything like indecent haste .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 21]: There is something solemnly funny about the struggles of a new-born Territorial government to get a start in this world .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 8]: Ours had a trying time of it .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 33]: The Organic Act and the `` instructions '' from the State Department commanded that a legislature should be elected at such-and-such a time , and its sittings inaugurated at such-and-such a date .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 62]: It was easy to get legislators , even at three dollars a day , although board was four dollars and fifty cents , for distinction has its charm in Nevada as well as elsewhere , and there were plenty of patriotic souls out of employment ; but to get a legislative hall for them to meet in was another matter altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 18]: Carson blandly declined to give a room rent-free , or let one to the government on credit .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 31]: But when Curry heard of the difficulty , he came forward , solitary and alone , and shouldered the Ship of State over the bar and got her afloat again .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 14]: I refer to `` Curry -- Old Curry -- Old Abe Curry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 15]: But for him the legislature would have been obliged to sit in the desert .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 20]: He offered his large stone building just outside the capital limits , rent-free , and it was gladly accepted .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 17]: Then he built a horse-railroad from town to the capitol , and carried the legislators gratis .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 26]: He also furnished pine benches and chairs for the legislature , and covered the floors with clean saw-dust by way of carpet and spittoon combined .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 13]: But for Curry the government would have died in its tender infancy .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 39]: A canvas partition to separate the Senate from the House of Representatives was put up by the Secretary , at a cost of three dollars and forty cents , but the United States declined to pay for it .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 69]: Upon being reminded that the `` instructions '' permitted the payment of a liberal rent for a legislative hall , and that that money was saved to the country by Mr. Curry 's generosity , the United States said that did not alter the matter , and the three dollars and forty cents would be subtracted from the Secretary 's eighteen hundred dollar salary -- and it was !
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 18]: The matter of printing was from the beginning an interesting feature of the new government 's difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 30]: The Secretary was sworn to obey his volume of written `` instructions , '' and these commanded him to do two certain things without fail , viz. : 1 .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 12]: Get the House and Senate journals printed ; and , 2 .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 33]: For this work , pay one dollar and fifty cents per `` thousand '' for composition , and one dollar and fifty cents per `` token '' for press-work , in greenbacks .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 24]: It was easy to swear to do these two things , but it was entirely impossible to do more than one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 44]: When greenbacks had gone down to forty cents on the dollar , the prices regularly charged everybody by printing establishments were one dollar and fifty cents per `` thousand '' and one dollar and fifty cents per `` token , '' in gold .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 27]: The `` instructions '' commanded that the Secretary regard a paper dollar issued by the government as equal to any other dollar issued by the government .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 9]: Hence the printing of the journals was discontinued .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 23]: Then the United States sternly rebuked the Secretary for disregarding the `` instructions , '' and warned him to correct his ways .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 50]: Wherefore he got some printing done , forwarded the bill to Washington with full exhibits of the high prices of things in the Territory , and called attention to a printed market report wherein it would be observed that even hay was two hundred and fifty dollars a ton .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 37]: The United States responded by subtracting the printing-bill from the Secretary 's suffering salary -- and moreover remarked with dense gravity that he would find nothing in his `` instructions '' requiring him to purchase hay !
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 18]: Nothing in this world is palled in such impenetrable obscurity as a U.S. Treasury Comptroller 's understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 18]: The very fires of the hereafter could get up nothing more than a fitful glimmer in it .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 52]: In the days I speak of he never could be made to comprehend why it was that twenty thousand dollars would not go as far in Nevada , where all commodities ranged at an enormous figure , as it would in the other Territories , where exceeding cheapness was the rule .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 15]: He was an officer who looked out for the little expenses all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 65]: The Secretary of the Territory kept his office in his bedroom , as I before remarked ; and he charged the United States no rent , although his `` instructions '' provided for that item and he could have justly taken advantage of it -LRB- a thing which I would have done with more than lightning promptness if I had been Secretary myself -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 9]: But the United States never applauded this devotion .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 18]: Indeed , I think my country was ashamed to have so improvident a person in its employ .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 75]: Those `` instructions '' -LRB- we used to read a chapter from them every morning , as intellectual gymnastics , and a couple of chapters in Sunday school every Sabbath , for they treated of all subjects under the sun and had much valuable religious matter in them along with the other statistics -RRB- those `` instructions '' commanded that pen-knives , envelopes , pens and writing-paper be furnished the members of the legislature .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 10]: So the Secretary made the purchase and the distribution .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 7]: The knives cost three dollars apiece .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 20]: There was one too many , and the Secretary gave it to the Clerk of the House of Representatives .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 34]: The United States said the Clerk of the House was not a `` member '' of the legislature , and took that three dollars out of the Secretary 's salary , as usual .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 16]: White men charged three or four dollars a `` load '' for sawing up stove-wood .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 40]: The Secretary was sagacious enough to know that the United States would never pay any such price as that ; so he got an Indian to saw up a load of office wood at one dollar and a half .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 55]: He made out the usual voucher , but signed no name to it -- simply appended a note explaining that an Indian had done the work , and had done it in a very capable and satisfactory way , but could not sign the voucher owing to lack of ability in the necessary direction .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 11]: The Secretary had to pay that dollar and a half .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 45]: He thought the United States would admire both his economy and his honesty in getting the work done at half price and not putting a pretended Indian 's signature to the voucher , but the United States did not see it in that light .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 31]: The United States was too much accustomed to employing dollar-and-a-half thieves in all manner of official capacities to regard his explanation of the voucher as having any foundation in fact .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 50]: But the next time the Indian sawed wood for us I taught him to make a cross at the bottom of the voucher -- it looked like a cross that had been drunk a year -- and then I `` witnessed '' it and it went through all right .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 8]: The United States never said a word .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 19]: I was sorry I had not made the voucher for a thousand loads of wood instead of one .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 38]: The government of my country snubs honest simplicity but fondles artistic villainy , and I think I might have developed into a very capable pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or two .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 13]: That was a fine collection of sovereigns , that first Nevada legislature .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 23]: They levied taxes to the amount of thirty or forty thousand dollars and ordered expenditures to the extent of about a million .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 17]: Yet they had their little periodical explosions of economy like all other bodies of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 18]: A member proposed to save three dollars a day to the nation by dispensing with the Chaplain .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 36]: And yet that short-sighted man needed the Chaplain more than any other member , perhaps , for he generally sat with his feet on his desk , eating raw turnips , during the morning prayer .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 15]: The legislature sat sixty days , and passed private tollroad franchises all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 39]: When they adjourned it was estimated that every citizen owned about three franchises , and it was believed that unless Congress gave the Territory another degree of longitude there would not be room enough to accommodate the toll-roads .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 15]: The ends of them were hanging over the boundary line everywhere like a fringe .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 32]: The fact is , the freighting business had grown to such important proportions that there was nearly as much excitement over suddenly acquired toll-road fortunes as over the wonderful silver mines .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 11]: By and by I was smitten with the silver fever .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 26]: `` Prospecting parties '' were leaving for the mountains every day , and discovering and taking possession of rich silver-bearing lodes and ledges of quartz .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 8]: Plainly this was the road to fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 34]: The great `` Gould and Curry '' mine was held at three or four hundred dollars a foot when we arrived ; but in two months it had sprung up to eight hundred .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 30]: The `` Ophir '' had been worth only a mere trifle , a year gone by , and now it was selling at nearly four thousand dollars a foot !
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 20]: Not a mine could be named that had not experienced an astonishing advance in value within a short time .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 7]: Everybody was talking about these marvels .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 18]: Go where you would , you heard nothing else , from morning till far into the night .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 31]: Tom So-and-So had sold out of the `` Amanda Smith '' for $ 40,000 -- had n't a cent when he `` took up '' the ledge six months ago .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 32]: John Jones had sold half his interest in the `` Bald Eagle and Mary Ann '' for $ 65,000 , gold coin , and gone to the States for his family .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 46]: The widow Brewster had `` struck it rich '' in the `` Golden Fleece '' and sold ten feet for $ 18,000 -- had n't money enough to buy a crape bonnet when Sing-Sing Tommy killed her husband at Baldy Johnson 's wake last spring .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 90]: The `` Last Chance '' had found a `` clay casing '' and knew they were `` right on the ledge '' -- consequence , `` feet '' that went begging yesterday were worth a brick house apiece to-day , and seedy owners who could not get trusted for a drink at any bar in the country yesterday were roaring drunk on champagne to-day and had hosts of warm personal friends in a town where they had forgotten how to bow or shake hands from long-continued want of practice .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 40]: Johnny Morgan , a common loafer , had gone to sleep in the gutter and waked up worth a hundred thousand dollars , in consequence of the decision in the `` Lady Franklin and Rough and Ready '' lawsuit .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 24]: And so on -- day in and day out the talk pelted our ears and the excitement waxed hotter and hotter around us .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 19]: I would have been more or less than human if I had not gone mad like the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 35]: Cart-loads of solid silver bricks , as large as pigs of lead , were arriving from the mills every day , and such sights as that gave substance to the wild talk about me .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 10]: I succumbed and grew as frenzied as the craziest .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 37]: Every few days news would come of the discovery of a bran-new mining region ; immediately the papers would teem with accounts of its richness , and away the surplus population would scamper to take possession .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 30]: By the time I was fairly inoculated with the disease , `` Esmeralda '' had just had a run and `` Humboldt '' was beginning to shriek for attention .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 3]: `` Humboldt !
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 3]: Humboldt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 45]: was the new cry , and straightway Humboldt , the newest of the new , the richest of the rich , the most marvellous of the marvellous discoveries in silver-land was occupying two columns of the public prints to `` Esmeralda 's '' one .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 22]: I was just on the point of starting to Esmeralda , but turned with the tide and got ready for Humboldt .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 34]: That the reader may see what moved me , and what would as surely have moved him had he been there , I insert here one of the newspaper letters of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 18]: It and several other letters from the same calm hand were the main means of converting me .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 27]: I shall not garble the extract , but put it in just as it appeared in the Daily Territorial Enterprise : But what about our mines ?
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 7]: I shall be candid with you .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 13]: I shall express an honest opinion , based upon a thorough examination .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 12]: Humboldt county is the richest mineral region upon God 's footstool .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 10]: Each mountain range is gorged with the precious ores .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 6]: Humboldt is the true Golconda .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 17]: The other day an assay of mere croppings yielded exceeding four thousand dollars to the ton .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 22]: A week or two ago an assay of just such surface developments made returns of seven thousand dollars to the ton .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 8]: Our mountains are full of rambling prospectors .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 23]: Each day and almost every hour reveals new and more startling evidences of the profuse and intensified wealth of our favored county .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 7]: The metal is not silver alone .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 8]: There are distinct ledges of auriferous ore .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 7]: A late discovery plainly evinces cinnabar .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 8]: The coarser metals are in gross abundance .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 9]: Lately evidences of bituminous coal have been detected .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 12]: My theory has ever been that coal is a ligneous formation .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 41]: I told Col. Whitman , in times past , that the neighborhood of Dayton -LRB- Nevada -RRB- betrayed no present or previous manifestations of a ligneous foundation , and that hence I had no confidence in his lauded coal mines .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 13]: I repeated the same doctrine to the exultant coal discoverers of Humboldt .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 11]: I talked with my friend Captain Burch on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 26]: My pyrhanism vanished upon his statement that in the very region referred to he had seen petrified trees of the length of two hundred feet .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 18]: Then is the fact established that huge forests once cast their grim shadows over this remote section .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 8]: I am firm in the coal faith .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 11]: Have no fears of the mineral resources of Humboldt county .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 6]: They are immense -- incalculable .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 21]: Let me state one or two things which will help the reader to better comprehend certain items in the above .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 21]: At this time , our near neighbor , Gold Hill , was the most successful silver mining locality in Nevada .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 16]: It was from there that more than half the daily shipments of silver bricks came .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 54]: `` Very rich '' -LRB- and scarce -RRB- Gold Hill ore yielded from $ 100 to $ 400 to the ton ; but the usual yield was only $ 20 to $ 40 per ton -- that is to say , each hundred pounds of ore yielded from one dollar to two dollars .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 24]: But the reader will perceive by the above extract , that in Humboldt from one fourth to nearly half the mass was silver !
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 27]: That is to say , every one hundred pounds of the ore had from two hundred dollars up to about three hundred and fifty in it .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 26]: Some days later this same correspondent wrote : I have spoken of the vast and almost fabulous wealth of this region -- it is incredible .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 13]: The intestines of our mountains are gorged with precious ore to plethora .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 23]: I have said that nature has so shaped our mountains as to furnish most excellent facilities for the working of our mines .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 21]: I have also told you that the country about here is pregnant with the finest mill sites in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 9]: But what is the mining history of Humboldt ?
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 13]: The Sheba mine is in the hands of energetic San Francisco capitalists .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 22]: It would seem that the ore is combined with metals that render it difficult of reduction with our imperfect mountain machinery .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 14]: The proprietors have combined the capital and labor hinted at in my exordium .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 6]: They are toiling and probing .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 11]: Their tunnel has reached the length of one hundred feet .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 33]: From primal assays alone , coupled with the development of the mine and public confidence in the continuance of effort , the stock had reared itself to eight hundred dollars market value .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 17]: I do not know that one ton of the ore has been converted into current metal .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 20]: I do know that there are many lodes in this section that surpass the Sheba in primal assay value .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 11]: Listen a moment to the calculations of the Sheba operators .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 9]: They purpose transporting the ore concentrated to Europe .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 43]: The conveyance from Star City -LRB- its locality -RRB- to Virginia City will cost seventy dollars per ton ; from Virginia to San Francisco , forty dollars per ton ; from thence to Liverpool , its destination , ten dollars per ton .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 43]: Their idea is that its conglomerate metals will reimburse them their cost of original extraction , the price of transportation , and the expense of reduction , and that then a ton of the raw ore will net them twelve hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 6]: The estimate may be extravagant .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 21]: Cut it in twain , and the product is enormous , far transcending any previous developments of our racy Territory .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 19]: A very common calculation is that many of our mines will yield five hundred dollars to the ton .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 23]: Such fecundity throws the Gould & Curry , the Ophir and the Mexican , of your neighborhood , in the darkest shadow .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 15]: I have given you the estimate of the value of a single developed mine .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 9]: Its richness is indexed by its market valuation .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 9]: The people of Humboldt county are feet crazy .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 10]: As I write , our towns are near deserted .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 9]: They look as languid as a consumptive girl .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 10]: What has become of our sinewy and athletic fellow-citizens ?
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 10]: They are coursing through ravines and over mountain tops .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 8]: Their tracks are visible in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 8]: Occasionally a horseman will dash among us .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 6]: His steed betrays hard usage .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 28]: He alights before his adobe dwelling , hastily exchanges courtesies with his townsmen , hurries to an assay office and from thence to the District Recorder 's .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 21]: In the morning , having renewed his provisional supplies , he is off again on his wild and unbeaten route .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 12]: Why , the fellow numbers already his feet by the thousands .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 5]: He is the horse-leech .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 11]: He has the craving stomach of the shark or anaconda .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 6]: He would conquer metallic worlds .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 4]: This was enough .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 19]: The instant we had finished reading the above article , four of us decided to go to Humboldt .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 7]: We commenced getting ready at once .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 56]: And we also commenced upbraiding ourselves for not deciding sooner -- for we were in terror lest all the rich mines would be found and secured before we got there , and we might have to put up with ledges that would not yield more than two or three hundred dollars a ton , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 56]: An hour before , I would have felt opulent if I had owned ten feet in a Gold Hill mine whose ore produced twenty-five dollars to the ton ; now I was already annoyed at the prospect of having to put up with mines the poorest of which would be a marvel in Gold Hill .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 6]: Hurry , was the word !
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 5]: We wasted no time .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 21]: Our party consisted of four persons -- a blacksmith sixty years of age , two young lawyers , and myself .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 10]: We bought a wagon and two miserable old horses .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 24]: We put eighteen hundred pounds of provisions and mining tools in the wagon and drove out of Carson on a chilly December afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 27]: The horses were so weak and old that we soon found that it would be better if one or two of us got out and walked .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 5]: It was an improvement .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 16]: Next , we found that it would be better if a third man got out .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 6]: That was an improvement also .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 38]: It was at this time that I volunteered to drive , although I had never driven a harnessed horse before and many a man in such a position would have felt fairly excused from such a responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 24]: But in a little while it was found that it would be a fine thing if the drive got out and walked also .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 19]: It was at this time that I resigned the position of driver , and never resumed it again .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 67]: Within the hour , we found that it would not only be better , but was absolutely necessary , that we four , taking turns , two at a time , should put our hands against the end of the wagon and push it through the sand , leaving the feeble horses little to do but keep out of the way and hold up the tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 19]: Perhaps it is well for one to know his fate at first , and get reconciled to it .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 8]: We had learned ours in one afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 22]: It was plain that we had to walk through the sand and shove that wagon and those horses two hundred miles .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 15]: So we accepted the situation , and from that time forth we never rode .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 15]: More than that , we stood regular and nearly constant watches pushing up behind .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 11]: We made seven miles , and camped in the desert .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 44]: Young Clagett -LRB- now member of Congress from Montana -RRB- unharnessed and fed and watered the horses ; Oliphant and I cut sagebrush , built the fire and brought water to cook with ; and old Mr. Ballou the blacksmith did the cooking .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 16]: This division of labor , and this appointment , was adhered to throughout the journey .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 17]: We had no tent , and so we slept under our blankets in the open plain .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 9]: We were so tired that we slept soundly .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 35]: We were fifteen days making the trip -- two hundred miles ; thirteen , rather , for we lay by a couple of days , in one place , to let the horses rest .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 53]: We could really have accomplished the journey in ten days if we had towed the horses behind the wagon , but we did not think of that until it was too late , and so went on shoving the horses and the wagon too when we might have saved half the labor .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 56]: Parties who met us , occasionally , advised us to put the horses in the wagon , but Mr. Ballou , through whose iron-clad earnestness no sarcasm could pierce , said that that would not do , because the provisions were exposed and would suffer , the horses being `` bituminous from long deprivation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 8]: The reader will excuse me from translating .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 22]: What Mr. Ballou customarily meant , when he used a long word , was a secret between himself and his Maker .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 19]: He was one of the best and kindest hearted men that ever graced a humble sphere of life .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 12]: He was gentleness and simplicity itself -- and unselfishness , too .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 29]: Although he was more than twice as old as the eldest of us , he never gave himself any airs , privileges , or exemptions on that account .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 38]: He did a young man 's share of the work ; and did his share of conversing and entertaining from the general stand-point of any age -- not from the arrogant , overawing summit-height of sixty years .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 36]: His one striking peculiarity was his Partingtonian fashion of loving and using big words for their own sakes , and independent of any bearing they might have upon the thought he was purposing to convey .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 18]: He always let his ponderous syllables fall with an easy unconsciousness that left them wholly without offensiveness .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 33]: In truth his air was so natural and so simple that one was always catching himself accepting his stately sentences as meaning something , when they really meant nothing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 54]: If a word was long and grand and resonant , that was sufficient to win the old man 's love , and he would drop that word into the most out-of-the-way place in a sentence or a subject , and be as pleased with it as if it were perfectly luminous with meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 70]: We four always spread our common stock of blankets together on the frozen ground , and slept side by side ; and finding that our foolish , long-legged hound pup had a deal of animal heat in him , Oliphant got to admitting him to the bed , between himself and Mr. Ballou , hugging the dog 's warm back to his breast and finding great comfort in it .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 84]: But in the night the pup would get stretchy and brace his feet against the old man 's back and shove , grunting complacently the while ; and now and then , being warm and snug , grateful and happy , he would paw the old man 's back simply in excess of comfort ; and at yet other times he would dream of the chase and in his sleep tug at the old man 's back hair and bark in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 58]: The old gentleman complained mildly about these familiarities , at last , and when he got through with his statement he said that such a dog as that was not a proper animal to admit to bed with tired men , because he was `` so meretricious in his movements and so organic in his emotions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 6]: We turned the dog out .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 79]: It was a hard , wearing , toilsome journey , but it had its bright side ; for after each day was done and our wolfish hunger appeased with a hot supper of fried bacon , bread , molasses and black coffee , the pipe-smoking , song-singing and yarn-spinning around the evening camp-fire in the still solitudes of the desert was a happy , care-free sort of recreation that seemed the very summit and culmination of earthly luxury .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 20]: It is a kind of life that has a potent charm for all men , whether city or country-bred .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 26]: We are descended from desert-lounging Arabs , and countless ages of growth toward perfect civilization have failed to root out of us the nomadic instinct .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 16]: We all confess to a gratified thrill at the thought of `` camping out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 45]: Once we made twenty-five miles in a day , and once we made forty miles -LRB- through the Great American Desert -RRB- , and ten miles beyond -- fifty in all -- in twenty-three hours , without halting to eat , drink or rest .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 42]: To stretch out and go to sleep , even on stony and frozen ground , after pushing a wagon and two horses fifty miles , is a delight so supreme that for the moment it almost seems cheap at the price .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 16]: We camped two days in the neighborhood of the `` Sink of the Humboldt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 18]: We tried to use the strong alkaline water of the Sink , but it would not answer .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 13]: It was like drinking lye , and not weak lye , either .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 25]: It left a taste in the mouth , bitter and every way execrable , and a burning in the stomach that was very uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 33]: We put molasses in it , but that helped it very little ; we added a pickle , yet the alkali was the prominent taste and so it was unfit for drinking .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 16]: The coffee we made of this water was the meanest compound man has yet invented .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 13]: It was really viler to the taste than the unameliorated water itself .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 58]: Mr. Ballou , being the architect and builder of the beverage felt constrained to endorse and uphold it , and so drank half a cup , by little sips , making shift to praise it faintly the while , but finally threw out the remainder , and said frankly it was `` too technical for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 35]: But presently we found a spring of fresh water , convenient , and then , with nothing to mar our enjoyment , and no stragglers to interrupt it , we entered into our rest .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 15]: After leaving the Sink , we traveled along the Humboldt river a little way .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 25]: People accustomed to the monster mile-wide Mississippi , grow accustomed to associating the term `` river '' with a high degree of watery grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 58]: Consequently , such people feel rather disappointed when they stand on the shores of the Humboldt or the Carson and find that a `` river '' in Nevada is a sickly rivulet which is just the counterpart of the Erie canal in all respects save that the canal is twice as long and four times as deep .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 31]: One of the pleasantest and most invigorating exercises one can contrive is to run and jump across the Humboldt river till he is overheated , and then drink it dry .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 27]: On the fifteenth day we completed our march of two hundred miles and entered Unionville , Humboldt county , in the midst of a driving snow-storm .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 9]: Unionville consisted of eleven cabins and a liberty-pole .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 21]: Six of the cabins were strung along one side of a deep canyon , and the other five faced them .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 44]: The rest of the landscape was made up of bleak mountain walls that rose so high into the sky from both sides of the canyon that the village was left , as it were , far down in the bottom of a crevice .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 19]: It was always daylight on the mountain tops a long time before the darkness lifted and revealed Unionville .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 50]: We built a small , rude cabin in the side of the crevice and roofed it with canvas , leaving a corner open to serve as a chimney , through which the cattle used to tumble occasionally , at night , and mash our furniture and interrupt our sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 10]: It was very cold weather and fuel was scarce .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 45]: Indians brought brush and bushes several miles on their backs ; and when we could catch a laden Indian it was well -- and when we could not -LRB- which was the rule , not the exception -RRB- , we shivered and bore it .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 20]: I confess , without shame , that I expected to find masses of silver lying all about the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 14]: I expected to see it glittering in the sun on the mountain summits .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 36]: I said nothing about this , for some instinct told me that I might possibly have an exaggerated idea about it , and so if I betrayed my thought I might bring derision upon myself .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 61]: Yet I was as perfectly satisfied in my own mind as I could be of anything , that I was going to gather up , in a day or two , or at furthest a week or two , silver enough to make me satisfactorily wealthy -- and so my fancy was already busy with plans for spending this money .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 69]: The first opportunity that offered , I sauntered carelessly away from the cabin , keeping an eye on the other boys , and stopping and contemplating the sky when they seemed to be observing me ; but as soon as the coast was manifestly clear , I fled away as guiltily as a thief might have done and never halted till I was far beyond sight and call .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 19]: Then I began my search with a feverish excitement that was brimful of expectation -- almost of certainty .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 34]: I crawled about the ground , seizing and examining bits of stone , blowing the dust from them or rubbing them on my clothes , and then peering at them with anxious hope .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 11]: Presently I found a bright fragment and my heart bounded !
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 30]: I hid behind a boulder and polished it and scrutinized it with a nervous eagerness and a delight that was more pronounced than absolute certainty itself could have afforded .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 20]: The more I examined the fragment the more I was convinced that I had found the door to fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 10]: I marked the spot and carried away my specimen .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 29]: Up and down the rugged mountain side I searched , with always increasing interest and always augmenting gratitude that I had come to Humboldt and come in time .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 24]: Of all the experiences of my life , this secret search among the hidden treasures of silver-land was the nearest to unmarred ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 6]: It was a delirious revel .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 28]: By and by , in the bed of a shallow rivulet , I found a deposit of shining yellow scales , and my breath almost forsook me !
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 16]: A gold mine , and in my simplicity I had been content with vulgar silver !
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 15]: I was so excited that I half believed my overwrought imagination was deceiving me .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 18]: Then a fear came upon me that people might be observing me and would guess my secret .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 20]: Moved by this thought , I made a circuit of the place , and ascended a knoll to reconnoiter .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 2]: Solitude .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 5]: No creature was near .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 26]: Then I returned to my mine , fortifying myself against possible disappointment , but my fears were groundless -- the shining scales were still there .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 24]: I set about scooping them out , and for an hour I toiled down the windings of the stream and robbed its bed .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 22]: But at last the descending sun warned me to give up the quest , and I turned homeward laden with wealth .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 32]: As I walked along I could not help smiling at the thought of my being so excited over my fragment of silver when a nobler metal was almost under my nose .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 26]: In this little time the former had so fallen in my estimation that once or twice I was on the point of throwing it away .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 14]: The boys were as hungry as usual , but I could eat nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 5]: Neither could I talk .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 9]: I was full of dreams and far away .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 18]: Their conversation interrupted the flow of my fancy somewhat , and annoyed me a little , too .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 11]: I despised the sordid and commonplace things they talked about .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 11]: But as they proceeded , it began to amuse me .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 46]: It grew to be rare fun to hear them planning their poor little economies and sighing over possible privations and distresses when a gold mine , all our own , lay within sight of the cabin and I could point it out at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 9]: Smothered hilarity began to oppress me , presently .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 21]: It was hard to resist the impulse to burst out with exultation and reveal everything ; but I did resist .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 31]: I said within myself that I would filter the great news through my lips calmly and be serene as a summer morning while I watched its effect in their faces .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 11]: I said : `` Where have you all been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 4]: `` Prospecting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 7]: `` What did you find ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 4]: `` Nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 3]: `` Nothing ?
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 9]: What do you think of the country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 30]: `` Ca n't tell , yet , '' said Mr. Ballou , who was an old gold miner , and had likewise had considerable experience among the silver mines .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 13]: `` Well , have n't you formed any sort of opinion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 9]: `` Yes , a sort of a one .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 12]: It 's fair enough here , may be , but overrated .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 9]: Seven thousand dollar ledges are scarce , though .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 38]: `` That Sheba may be rich enough , but we do n't own it ; and besides , the rock is so full of base metals that all the science in the world ca n't work it .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 19]: We 'll not starve , here , but we 'll not get rich , I 'm afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 11]: `` So you think the prospect is pretty poor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 7]: `` No name for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 14]: `` Well , we 'd better go back , had n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 10]: `` Oh , not yet -- of course not .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 10]: We 'll try it a riffle , first . ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 40]: `` Suppose , now -- this is merely a supposition , you know -- suppose you could find a ledge that would yield , say , a hundred and fifty dollars a ton -- would that satisfy you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 6]: `` Try us once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 5]: from the whole party .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 33]: `` Or suppose -- merely a supposition , of course -- suppose you were to find a ledge that would yield two thousand dollars a ton -- would that satisfy you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 8]: `` Here -- what do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 6]: What are you coming at ?
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 9]: Is there some mystery behind all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 6]: I am not saying anything .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 16]: You know perfectly well there are no rich mines here -- of course you do .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 10]: Because you have been around and examined for yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 10]: Anybody would know that , that had been around .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 69]: But just for the sake of argument , suppose -- in a kind of general way -- suppose some person were to tell you that two-thousand-dollar ledges were simply contemptible -- contemptible , understand -- and that right yonder in sight of this very cabin there were piles of pure gold and pure silver -- oceans of it -- enough to make you all rich in twenty-four hours !
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 13]: `` I should say he was as crazy as a loon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 11]: said old Ballou , but wild with excitement , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 58]: `` Gentlemen , '' said I , `` I do n't say anything -- I have n't been around , you know , and of course do n't know anything -- but all I ask of you is to cast your eye on that , for instance , and tell me what you think of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 8]: and I tossed my treasure before them .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 20]: There was an eager scramble for it , and a closing of heads together over it under the candle-light .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 10]: Then old Ballou said : `` Think of it ?
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 25]: I think it is nothing but a lot of granite rubbish and nasty glittering mica that is n't worth ten cents an acre ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 5]: So vanished my dream .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 6]: So melted my wealth away .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 15]: So toppled my airy castle to the earth and left me stricken and forlorn .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 17]: Moralizing , I observed , then , that `` all that glitters is not gold . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 27]: Mr. Ballou said I could go further than that , and lay it up among my treasures of knowledge , that nothing that glitters is gold .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 38]: So I learned then , once for all , that gold in its native state is but dull , unornamental stuff , and that only low-born metals excite the admiration of the ignorant with an ostentatious glitter .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 23]: However , like the rest of the world , I still go on underrating men of gold and glorifying men of mica .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 9]: Commonplace human nature can not rise above that .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 12]: True knowledge of the nature of silver mining came fast enough .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 10]: We went out `` prospecting '' with Mr. Ballou .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 33]: We climbed the mountain sides , and clambered among sage-brush , rocks and snow till we were ready to drop with exhaustion , but found no silver -- nor yet any gold .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 7]: Day after day we did this .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 32]: Now and then we came upon holes burrowed a few feet into the declivities and apparently abandoned ; and now and then we found one or two listless men still burrowing .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 8]: But there was no appearance of silver .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 34]: These holes were the beginnings of tunnels , and the purpose was to drive them hundreds of feet into the mountain , and some day tap the hidden ledge where the silver was .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 3]: Some day !
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 12]: It seemed far enough away , and very hopeless and dreary .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 25]: Day after day we toiled , and climbed and searched , and we younger partners grew sicker and still sicker of the promiseless toil .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 20]: At last we halted under a beetling rampart of rock which projected from the earth high upon the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 46]: Mr. Ballou broke off some fragments with a hammer , and examined them long and attentively with a small eye-glass ; threw them away and broke off more ; said this rock was quartz , and quartz was the sort of rock that contained silver .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 3]: Contained it !
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 21]: I had thought that at least it would be caked on the outside of it like a kind of veneering .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 24]: He still broke off pieces and critically examined them , now and then wetting the piece with his tongue and applying the glass .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 12]: At last he exclaimed : `` We 've got it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 9]: We were full of anxiety in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 22]: The rock was clean and white , where it was broken , and across it ran a ragged thread of blue .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 38]: He said that that little thread had silver in it , mixed with base metal , such as lead and antimony , and other rubbish , and that there was a speck or two of gold visible .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 35]: After a great deal of effort we managed to discern some little fine yellow specks , and judged that a couple of tons of them massed together might make a gold dollar , possibly .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 19]: We were not jubilant , but Mr. Ballou said there were worse ledges in the world than that .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 29]: He saved what he called the `` richest '' piece of the rock , in order to determine its value by the process called the `` fire-assay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 58]: Then we named the mine `` Monarch of the Mountains '' -LRB- modesty of nomenclature is not a prominent feature in the mines -RRB- , and Mr. Ballou wrote out and stuck up the following `` notice , '' preserving a copy to be entered upon the books in the mining recorder 's office in the town .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 4]: `` NOTICE . ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 65]: `` We the undersigned claim three claims , of three hundred feet each -LRB- and one for discovery -RRB- , on this silver-bearing quartz lead or lode , extending north and south from this notice , with all its dips , spurs , and angles , variations and sinuosities , together with fifty feet of ground on either side for working the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 16]: We put our names to it and tried to feel that our fortunes were made .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 18]: But when we talked the matter all over with Mr. Ballou , we felt depressed and dubious .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 122]: He said that this surface quartz was not all there was of our mine ; but that the wall or ledge of rock called the `` Monarch of the Mountains , '' extended down hundreds and hundreds of feet into the earth -- he illustrated by saying it was like a curb-stone , and maintained a nearly uniform thickness-say twenty feet -- away down into the bowels of the earth , and was perfectly distinct from the casing rock on each side of it ; and that it kept to itself , and maintained its distinctive character always , no matter how deep it extended into the earth or how far it stretched itself through and across the hills and valleys .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 53]: He said it might be a mile deep and ten miles long , for all we knew ; and that wherever we bored into it above ground or below , we would find gold and silver in it , but no gold or silver in the meaner rock it was cased between .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 26]: And he said that down in the great depths of the ledge was its richness , and the deeper it went the richer it grew .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 64]: Therefore , instead of working here on the surface , we must either bore down into the rock with a shaft till we came to where it was rich -- say a hundred feet or so -- or else we must go down into the valley and bore a long tunnel into the mountain side and tap the ledge far under the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 28]: To do either was plainly the labor of months ; for we could blast and bore only a few feet a day -- some five or six .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 6]: But this was not all .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 34]: He said that after we got the ore out it must be hauled in wagons to a distant silver-mill , ground up , and the silver extracted by a tedious and costly process .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 7]: Our fortune seemed a century away !
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 6]: But we went to work .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 7]: We decided to sink a shaft .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 37]: So , for a week we climbed the mountain , laden with picks , drills , gads , crowbars , shovels , cans of blasting powder and coils of fuse and strove with might and main .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 29]: At first the rock was broken and loose and we dug it up with picks and threw it out with shovels , and the hole progressed very well .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 17]: But the rock became more compact , presently , and gads and crowbars came into play .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 11]: But shortly nothing could make an impression but blasting powder .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 6]: That was the weariest work !
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 29]: One of us held the iron drill in its place and another would strike with an eight-pound sledge -- it was like driving nails on a large scale .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 30]: In the course of an hour or two the drill would reach a depth of two or three feet , making a hole a couple of inches in diameter .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 33]: We would put in a charge of powder , insert half a yard of fuse , pour in sand and gravel and ram it down , then light the fuse and run .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 32]: When the explosion came and the rocks and smoke shot into the air , we would go back and find about a bushel of that hard , rebellious quartz jolted out .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 3]: Nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 7]: One week of this satisfied me .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 3]: I resigned .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 5]: Clagget and Oliphant followed .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 8]: Our shaft was only twelve feet deep .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 11]: We decided that a tunnel was the thing we wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 47]: So we went down the mountain side and worked a week ; at the end of which time we had blasted a tunnel about deep enough to hide a hogshead in , and judged that about nine hundred feet more of it would reach the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 15]: I resigned again , and the other boys only held out one day longer .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 11]: We decided that a tunnel was not what we wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 11]: We wanted a ledge that was already `` developed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 7]: There were none in the camp .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 11]: We dropped the `` Monarch '' for the time being .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 21]: Meantime the camp was filling up with people , and there was a constantly growing excitement about our Humboldt mines .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 17]: We fell victims to the epidemic and strained every nerve to acquire more `` feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 20]: We prospected and took up new claims , put `` notices '' on them and gave them grandiloquent names .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 18]: We traded some of our `` feet '' for `` feet '' in other people 's claims .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 101]: In a little while we owned largely in the `` Gray Eagle , '' the `` Columbiana , '' the `` Branch Mint , '' the `` Maria Jane , '' the `` Universe , '' the `` Root-Hog-or-Die , '' the `` Samson and Delilah , '' the `` Treasure Trove , '' the `` Golconda , '' the `` Sultana , '' the `` Boomerang , '' the `` Great Republic , '' the `` Grand Mogul , '' and fifty other `` mines '' that had never been molested by a shovel or scratched with a pick .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 34]: We had not less than thirty thousand `` feet '' apiece in the `` richest mines on earth '' as the frenzied cant phrased it -- and were in debt to the butcher .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 42]: We were stark mad with excitement -- drunk with happiness -- smothered under mountains of prospective wealth -- arrogantly compassionate toward the plodding millions who knew not our marvellous canyon -- but our credit was not good at the grocer 's .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 11]: It was the strangest phase of life one can imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 7]: It was a beggars ' revel .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 55]: There was nothing doing in the district -- no mining -- no milling -- no productive effort -- no income -- and not enough money in the entire camp to buy a corner lot in an eastern village , hardly ; and yet a stranger would have supposed he was walking among bloated millionaires .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 25]: Prospecting parties swarmed out of town with the first flush of dawn , and swarmed in again at nightfall laden with spoil -- rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 4]: Nothing but rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 29]: Every man 's pockets were full of them ; the floor of his cabin was littered with them ; they were disposed in labeled rows on his shelves .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 59]: I met men at every turn who owned from one thousand to thirty thousand `` feet '' in undeveloped silver mines , every single foot of which they believed would shortly be worth from fifty to a thousand dollars -- and as often as any other way they were men who had not twenty-five dollars in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 91]: Every man you met had his new mine to boast of , and his `` specimens '' ready ; and if the opportunity offered , he would infallibly back you into a corner and offer as a favor to you , not to him , to part with just a few feet in the `` Golden Age , '' or the `` Sarah Jane , '' or some other unknown stack of croppings , for money enough to get a `` square meal '' with , as the phrase went .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 37]: And you were never to reveal that he had made you the offer at such a ruinous price , for it was only out of friendship for you that he was willing to make the sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 60]: Then he would fish a piece of rock out of his pocket , and after looking mysteriously around as if he feared he might be waylaid and robbed if caught with such wealth in his possession , he would dab the rock against his tongue , clap an eyeglass to it , and exclaim : `` Look at that !
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 7]: Right there in that red dirt !
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 3]: See it ?
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 6]: See the specks of gold ?
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 6]: And the streak of silver ?
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 7]: That 's from the Uncle Abe .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 11]: There 's a hundred thousand tons like that in sight !
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 7]: Right in sight , mind you !
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 24]: And when we get down on it and the ledge comes in solid , it will be the richest thing in the world !
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 5]: Look at the assay !
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 15]: I do n't want you to believe me -- look at the assay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 41]: Then he would get out a greasy sheet of paper which showed that the portion of rock assayed had given evidence of containing silver and gold in the proportion of so many hundreds or thousands of dollars to the ton .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 23]: I little knew , then , that the custom was to hunt out the richest piece of rock and get it assayed !
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 49]: Very often , that piece , the size of a filbert , was the only fragment in a ton that had a particle of metal in it -- and yet the assay made it pretend to represent the average value of the ton of rubbish it came from !
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 16]: On such a system of assaying as that , the Humboldt world had gone crazy .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 22]: On the authority of such assays its newspaper correspondents were frothing about rock worth four and seven thousand dollars a ton !
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 72]: And does the reader remember , a few pages back , the calculations , of a quoted correspondent , whereby the ore is to be mined and shipped all the way to England , the metals extracted , and the gold and silver contents received back by the miners as clear profit , the copper , antimony and other things in the ore being sufficient to pay all the expenses incurred ?
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 19]: Everybody 's head was full of such `` calculations '' as those -- such raving insanity , rather .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 23]: Few people took work into their calculations -- or outlay of money either ; except the work and expenditures of other people .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 10]: We never touched our tunnel or our shaft again .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 56]: Because we judged that we had learned the real secret of success in silver mining -- which was , not to mine the silver ourselves by the sweat of our brows and the labor of our hands , but to sell the ledges to the dull slaves of toil and let them do the mining !
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 18]: Before leaving Carson , the Secretary and I had purchased `` feet '' from various Esmeralda stragglers .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 31]: We had expected immediate returns of bullion , but were only afflicted with regular and constant `` assessments '' instead -- demands for money wherewith to develop the said mines .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 17]: These assessments had grown so oppressive that it seemed necessary to look into the matter personally .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 12]: Therefore I projected a pilgrimage to Carson and thence to Esmeralda .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 62]: I bought a horse and started , in company with Mr. Ballou and a gentleman named Ollendorff , a Prussian -- not the party who has inflicted so much suffering on the world with his wretched foreign grammars , with their interminable repetitions of questions which never have occurred and are never likely to occur in any conversation among human beings .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 31]: We rode through a snow-storm for two or three days , and arrived at `` Honey Lake Smith 's , '' a sort of isolated inn on the Carson river .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 30]: It was a two-story log house situated on a small knoll in the midst of the vast basin or desert through which the sickly Carson winds its melancholy way .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 15]: Close to the house were the Overland stage stables , built of sun-dried bricks .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 12]: There was not another building within several leagues of the place .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 27]: Towards sunset about twenty hay-wagons arrived and camped around the house and all the teamsters came in to supper -- a very , very rough set .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 27]: There were one or two Overland stage drivers there , also , and half a dozen vagabonds and stragglers ; consequently the house was well crowded .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 17]: We walked out , after supper , and visited a small Indian camp in the vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 23]: The Indians were in a great hurry about something , and were packing up and getting away as fast as they could .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 17]: In their broken English they said , `` By 'm - by , heap water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 18]: and by the help of signs made us understand that in their opinion a flood was coming .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 14]: The weather was perfectly clear , and this was not the rainy season .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 42]: There was about a foot of water in the insignificant river -- or maybe two feet ; the stream was not wider than a back alley in a village , and its banks were scarcely higher than a man 's head .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 10]: So , where was the flood to come from ?
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 38]: We canvassed the subject awhile and then concluded it was a ruse , and that the Indians had some better reason for leaving in a hurry than fears of a flood in such an exceedingly dry time .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 62]: At seven in the evening we went to bed in the second story -- with our clothes on , as usual , and all three in the same bed , for every available space on the floors , chairs , etc. , was in request , and even then there was barely room for the housing of the inn 's guests .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 41]: An hour later we were awakened by a great turmoil , and springing out of bed we picked our way nimbly among the ranks of snoring teamsters on the floor and got to the front windows of the long room .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 11]: A glance revealed a strange spectacle , under the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 48]: The crooked Carson was full to the brim , and its waters were raging and foaming in the wildest way -- sweeping around the sharp bends at a furious speed , and bearing on their surface a chaos of logs , brush and all sorts of rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 35]: A depression , where its bed had once been , in other times , was already filling , and in one or two places the water was beginning to wash over the main bank .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 42]: Men were flying hither and thither , bringing cattle and wagons close up to the house , for the spot of high ground on which it stood extended only some thirty feet in front and about a hundred in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 24]: Close to the old river bed just spoken of , stood a little log stable , and in this our horses were lodged .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 34]: While we looked , the waters increased so fast in this place that in a few minutes a torrent was roaring by the little stable and its margin encroaching steadily on the logs .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 56]: We suddenly realized that this flood was not a mere holiday spectacle , but meant damage -- and not only to the small log stable but to the Overland buildings close to the main river , for the waves had now come ashore and were creeping about the foundations and invading the great hay-corral adjoining .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 14]: We ran down and joined the crowd of excited men and frightened animals .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 23]: We waded knee-deep into the log stable , unfastened the horses and waded out almost waist-deep , so fast the waters increased .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 34]: Then the crowd rushed in a body to the hay-corral and began to tumble down the huge stacks of baled hay and roll the bales up on the high ground by the house .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 45]: Meantime it was discovered that Owens , an overland driver , was missing , and a man ran to the large stable , and wading in , boot-top deep , discovered him asleep in his bed , awoke him , and waded out again .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 40]: But Owens was drowsy and resumed his nap ; but only for a minute or two , for presently he turned in his bed , his hand dropped over the side and came in contact with the cold water !
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 8]: It was up level with the mattress !
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 35]: He waded out , breast-deep , almost , and the next moment the sun-burned bricks melted down like sugar and the big building crumbled to a ruin and was washed away in a twinkling .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 26]: At eleven o'clock only the roof of the little log stable was out of water , and our inn was on an island in mid-ocean .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 27]: As far as the eye could reach , in the moonlight , there was no desert visible , but only a level waste of shining water .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 14]: The Indians were true prophets , but how did they get their information ?
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 9]: I am not able to answer the question .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 13]: We remained cooped up eight days and nights with that curious crew .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 23]: Swearing , drinking and card playing were the order of the day , and occasionally a fight was thrown in for variety .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 25]: Dirt and vermin -- but let us forget those features ; their profusion is simply inconceivable -- it is better that they remain so .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 13]: There were two men -- however , this chapter is long enough .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 13]: There were two men in the company who caused me particular discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 24]: One was a little Swede , about twenty-five years old , who knew only one song , and he was forever singing it .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 24]: By day we were all crowded into one small , stifling bar-room , and so there was no escaping this person 's music .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 53]: Through all the profanity , whisky-guzzling , `` old sledge '' and quarreling , his monotonous song meandered with never a variation in its tiresome sameness , and it seemed to me , at last , that I would be content to die , in order to be rid of the torture .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 40]: The other man was a stalwart ruffian called `` Arkansas , '' who carried two revolvers in his belt and a bowie knife projecting from his boot , and who was always drunk and always suffering for a fight .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 12]: But he was so feared , that nobody would accommodate him .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 59]: He would try all manner of little wary ruses to entrap somebody into an offensive remark , and his face would light up now and then when he fancied he was fairly on the scent of a fight , but invariably his victim would elude his toils and then he would show a disappointment that was almost pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 36]: The landlord , Johnson , was a meek , well-meaning fellow , and Arkansas fastened on him early , as a promising subject , and gave him no rest day or night , for awhile .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 18]: On the fourth morning , Arkansas got drunk and sat himself down to wait for an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 32]: Presently Johnson came in , just comfortably sociable with whisky , and said : `` I reckon the Pennsylvania ` lection -- '' Arkansas raised his finger impressively and Johnson stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 7]: Arkansas rose unsteadily and confronted him .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 13]: Said he : `` Wha-what do you know a -- about Pennsylvania ?
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 4]: Answer me that .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 11]: Wha -- what do you know ` bout Pennsylvania ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 19]: `` I was only goin ' to say -- '' `` You was only goin ' to say .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 3]: You was !
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 16]: You was only goin ' to say -- what was you goin ' to say ?
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 4]: That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 8]: That 's what I want to know .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 30]: I want to know wha -- what you -LRB- ` ic -RRB- what you know about Pennsylvania , since you 're makin ' yourself so d -- d free .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 5]: Answer me that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 20]: `` Mr. Arkansas , if you 'd only let me -- '' `` Who 's a henderin ' you ?
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 8]: Do n't you insinuate nothing agin me !
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 7]: -- do n't you do it .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 27]: Do n't you come in here bullyin ' around , and cussin ' and goin ' on like a lunatic -- do n't you do it .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 8]: ` Coz I wo n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 11]: If fight 's what you want , out with it !
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 5]: I 'm your man !
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 5]: Out with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 24]: Said Johnson , backing into a corner , Arkansas following , menacingly : `` Why , I never said nothing , Mr. Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 9]: You do n't give a man no chance .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 45]: I was only goin ' to say that Pennsylvania was goin ' to have an election next week -- that was all -- that was everything I was goin ' to say -- I wish I may never stir if it was n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 10]: `` Well then why d' n't you say it ?
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 19]: What did you come swellin ' around that way for , and tryin ' to raise trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 25]: `` Why I did n't come swellin ' around , Mr. Arkansas -- I just -- '' `` I 'm a liar am I !
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 32]: Ger-reat Caesar 's ghost -- '' `` Oh , please , Mr. Arkansas , I never meant such a thing as that , I wish I may die if I did .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 26]: All the boys will tell you that I 've always spoke well of you , and respected you more 'n any man in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 3]: Ask Smith .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 7]: Ai n't it so , Smith ?
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 34]: Did n't I say , no longer ago than last night , that for a man that was a gentleman all the time and every way you took him , give me Arkansas ?
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 18]: I 'll leave it to any gentleman here if them war n't the very words I used .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 22]: Come , now , Mr. Arkansas , le 's take a drink -- le 's shake hands and take a drink .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 5]: Come up -- everybody !
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 5]: It 's my treat .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 14]: Come up , Bill , Tom , Bob , Scotty -- come up .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 24]: I want you all to take a drink with me and Arkansas -- old Arkansas , I call him -- bully old Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 6]: Gim me your hand agin .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 13]: Look at him , boys -- just take a look at him .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 8]: Thar stands the whitest man in America !
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 17]: -- and the man that denies it has got to fight me , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 8]: Gim me that old flipper agin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 35]: They embraced , with drunken affection on the landlord 's part and unresponsive toleration on the part of Arkansas , who , bribed by a drink , was disappointed of his prey once more .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 28]: But the foolish landlord was so happy to have escaped butchery , that he went on talking when he ought to have marched himself out of danger .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 35]: The consequence was that Arkansas shortly began to glower upon him dangerously , and presently said : `` Lan ` lord , will you p-please make that remark over agin if you please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 23]: `` I was a-sayin ' to Scotty that my father was up ` ards of eighty year old when he died . ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 9]: `` Was that all that you said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 8]: `` Yes , that was all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 9]: `` Did n't say nothing but that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 6]: `` No -- nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 5]: Then an uncomfortable silence .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 16]: Arkansas played with his glass a moment , lolling on his elbows on the counter .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 18]: Then he meditatively scratched his left shin with his right boot , while the awkward silence continued .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 59]: But presently he loafed away toward the stove , looking dissatisfied ; roughly shouldered two or three men out of a comfortable position ; occupied it himself , gave a sleeping dog a kick that sent him howling under a bench , then spread his long legs and his blanket-coat tails apart and proceeded to warm his back .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 44]: In a little while he fell to grumbling to himself , and soon he slouched back to the bar and said : `` Lan ` lord , what 's your idea for rakin ' up old personalities and blowin ' about your father ?
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 8]: Ai n't this company agreeable to you ?
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 4]: Ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 19]: If this company ai n't agreeable to you , p ` r ` aps we 'd better leave .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 5]: Is that your idea ?
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 9]: Is that what you 're coming at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 17]: `` Why bless your soul , Arkansas , I war n't thinking of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 18]: My father and my mother -- '' `` Lan ` lord , do n't crowd a man !
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 5]: Do n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 50]: If nothing 'll do you but a disturbance , out with it like a man -LRB- ` ic -RRB- -- but do n't rake up old bygones and fling 'em in the teeth of a passel of people that wants to be peaceable if they could git a chance .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 12]: What 's the matter with you this mornin ' , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 10]: I never see a man carry on so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 26]: `` Arkansas , I reely did n't mean no harm , and I wo n't go on with it if it 's onpleasant to you .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 44]: I reckon my licker 's got into my head , and what with the flood , and havin ' so many to feed and look out for -- '' `` So that 's what 's a-ranklin ' in your heart , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 8]: You want us to leave do you ?
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 7]: There 's too many on us .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 9]: You want us to pack up and swim .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 4]: Is that it ?
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 7]: `` Please be reasonable , Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 20]: Now you know that I ai n't the man to -- '' `` Are you a threatenin ' me ?
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 3]: Are you ?
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 13]: By George , the man do n't live that can skeer me !
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 28]: Do n't you try to come that game , my chicken -- ` cuz I can stand a good deal , but I wo n't stand that .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 11]: Come out from behind that bar till I clean you !
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 16]: You want to drive us out , do you , you sneakin ' underhanded hound !
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 7]: Come out from behind that bar !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 27]: I 'll learn you to bully and badger and browbeat a gentleman that 's forever trying to befriend you and keep you out of trouble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 10]: `` Please , Arkansas , please do n't shoot !
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 17]: If there 's got to be bloodshed -- '' `` Do you hear that , gentlemen ?
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 8]: Do you hear him talk about bloodshed ?
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 15]: So it 's blood you want , is it , you ravin ' desperado !
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 19]: You 'd made up your mind to murder somebody this mornin ' -- I knowed it perfectly well .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 8]: I 'm the man , am I ?
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 13]: It 's me you 're goin ' to murder , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 25]: But you ca n't do it ` thout I get one chance first , you thievin ' black-hearted , white-livered son of a nigger !
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 5]: Draw your weepon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 29]: With that , Arkansas began to shoot , and the landlord to clamber over benches , men and every sort of obstacle in a frantic desire to escape .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 40]: In the midst of the wild hubbub the landlord crashed through a glass door , and as Arkansas charged after him the landlord 's wife suddenly appeared in the doorway and confronted the desperado with a pair of scissors !
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 5]: Her fury was magnificent .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 19]: With head erect and flashing eye she stood a moment and then advanced , with her weapon raised .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 12]: The astonished ruffian hesitated , and then fell back a step .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 3]: She followed .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 43]: She backed him step by step into the middle of the bar-room , and then , while the wondering crowd closed up and gazed , she gave him such another tongue-lashing as never a cowed and shamefaced braggart got before , perhaps !
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 32]: As she finished and retired victorious , a roar of applause shook the house , and every man ordered `` drinks for the crowd '' in one and the same breath .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 6]: The lesson was entirely sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 15]: The reign of terror was over , and the Arkansas domination broken for good .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 57]: During the rest of the season of island captivity , there was one man who sat apart in a state of permanent humiliation , never mixing in any quarrel or uttering a boast , and never resenting the insults the once cringing crew now constantly leveled at him , and that man was `` Arkansas . ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 36]: By the fifth or sixth morning the waters had subsided from the land , but the stream in the old river bed was still high and swift and there was no possibility of crossing it .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 46]: On the eighth it was still too high for an entirely safe passage , but life in the inn had become next to insupportable by reason of the dirt , drunkenness , fighting , etc. , and so we made an effort to get away .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 27]: In the midst of a heavy snow-storm we embarked in a canoe , taking our saddles aboard and towing our horses after us by their halters .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 30]: The Prussian , Ollendorff , was in the bow , with a paddle , Ballou paddled in the middle , and I sat in the stern holding the halters .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 67]: When the horses lost their footing and began to swim , Ollendorff got frightened , for there was great danger that the horses would make our aim uncertain , and it was plain that if we failed to land at a certain spot the current would throw us off and almost surely cast us into the main Carson , which was a boiling torrent , now .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 28]: Such a catastrophe would be death , in all probability , for we would be swept to sea in the `` Sink '' or overturned and drowned .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 41]: We warned Ollendorff to keep his wits about him and handle himself carefully , but it was useless ; the moment the bow touched the bank , he made a spring and the canoe whirled upside down in ten-foot water .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 24]: Ollendorff seized some brush and dragged himself ashore , but Ballou and I had to swim for it , encumbered with our overcoats .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 32]: But we held on to the canoe , and although we were washed down nearly to the Carson , we managed to push the boat ashore and make a safe landing .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 9]: We were cold and water-soaked , but safe .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 17]: The horses made a landing , too , but our saddles were gone , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 17]: We tied the animals in the sage-brush and there they had to stay for twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 32]: We baled out the canoe and ferried over some food and blankets for them , but we slept one more night in the inn before making another venture on our journey .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 21]: The next morning it was still snowing furiously when we got away with our new stock of saddles and accoutrements .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 5]: We mounted and started .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 48]: The snow lay so deep on the ground that there was no sign of a road perceptible , and the snow-fall was so thick that we could not see more than a hundred yards ahead , else we could have guided our course by the mountain ranges .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 35]: The case looked dubious , but Ollendorff said his instinct was as sensitive as any compass , and that he could `` strike a bee-line '' for Carson city and never diverge from it .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 26]: He said that if he were to straggle a single point out of the true line his instinct would assail him like an outraged conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 10]: Consequently we dropped into his wake happy and content .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 43]: For half an hour we poked along warily enough , but at the end of that time we came upon a fresh trail , and Ollendorff shouted proudly : `` I knew I was as dead certain as a compass , boys !
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 20]: Here we are , right in somebody 's tracks that will hunt the way for us without any trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 12]: Let 's hurry up and join company with the party . ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 39]: So we put the horses into as much of a trot as the deep snow would allow , and before long it was evident that we were gaining on our predecessors , for the tracks grew more distinct .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 39]: We hurried along , and at the end of an hour the tracks looked still newer and fresher -- but what surprised us was , that the number of travelers in advance of us seemed to steadily increase .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 21]: We wondered how so large a party came to be traveling at such a time and in such a solitude .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 37]: Somebody suggested that it must be a company of soldiers from the fort , and so we accepted that solution and jogged along a little faster still , for they could not be far off now .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 32]: But the tracks still multiplied , and we began to think the platoon of soldiers was miraculously expanding into a regiment -- Ballou said they had already increased to five hundred !
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 42]: Presently he stopped his horse and said : `` Boys , these are our own tracks , and we 've actually been circussing round and round in a circle for more than two hours , out here in this blind desert !
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 8]: By George this is perfectly hydraulic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 9]: Then the old man waxed wroth and abusive .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 41]: He called Ollendorff all manner of hard names -- said he never saw such a lurid fool as he was , and ended with the peculiarly venomous opinion that he `` did not know as much as a logarythm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 9]: We certainly had been following our own tracks .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 14]: Ollendorff and his `` mental compass '' were in disgrace from that moment .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 28]: After all our hard travel , here we were on the bank of the stream again , with the inn beyond dimly outlined through the driving snow-fall .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 60]: While we were considering what to do , the young Swede landed from the canoe and took his pedestrian way Carson-wards , singing his same tiresome song about his `` sister and his brother '' and `` the child in the grave with its mother , '' and in a short minute faded and disappeared in the white oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 7]: He was never heard of again .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 22]: He no doubt got bewildered and lost , and Fatigue delivered him over to Sleep and Sleep betrayed him to Death .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 13]: Possibly he followed our treacherous tracks till he became exhausted and dropped .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 23]: Presently the Overland stage forded the now fast receding stream and started toward Carson on its first trip since the flood came .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 34]: We hesitated no longer , now , but took up our march in its wake , and trotted merrily along , for we had good confidence in the driver 's bump of locality .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 12]: But our horses were no match for the fresh stage team .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 27]: We were soon left out of sight ; but it was no matter , for we had the deep ruts the wheels made for a guide .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 47]: By this time it was three in the afternoon , and consequently it was not very long before night came -- and not with a lingering twilight , but with a sudden shutting down like a cellar door , as is its habit in that country .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 67]: The snowfall was still as thick as ever , and of course we could not see fifteen steps before us ; but all about us the white glare of the snow-bed enabled us to discern the smooth sugar-loaf mounds made by the covered sage-bushes , and just in front of us the two faint grooves which we knew were the steadily filling and slowly disappearing wheel-tracks .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 112]: Now those sage-bushes were all about the same height -- three or four feet ; they stood just about seven feet apart , all over the vast desert ; each of them was a mere snow-mound , now ; in any direction that you proceeded -LRB- the same as in a well laid out orchard -RRB- you would find yourself moving down a distinctly defined avenue , with a row of these snow-mounds an either side of it -- an avenue the customary width of a road , nice and level in its breadth , and rising at the sides in the most natural way , by reason of the mounds .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 8]: But we had not thought of this .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 66]: Then imagine the chilly thrill that shot through us when it finally occurred to us , far in the night , that since the last faint trace of the wheel-tracks had long ago been buried from sight , we might now be wandering down a mere sage-brush avenue , miles away from the road and diverging further and further away from it all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 17]: Having a cake of ice slipped down one 's back is placid comfort compared to it .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 33]: There was a sudden leap and stir of blood that had been asleep for an hour , and as sudden a rousing of all the drowsing activities in our minds and bodies .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 17]: We were alive and awake at once -- and shaking and quaking with consternation , too .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 19]: There was an instant halting and dismounting , a bending low and an anxious scanning of the road-bed .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 37]: Useless , of course ; for if a faint depression could not be discerned from an altitude of four or five feet above it , it certainly could not with one 's nose nearly against it .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 14]: We seemed to be in a road , but that was no proof .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 40]: We tested this by walking off in various directions -- the regular snow-mounds and the regular avenues between them convinced each man that he had found the true road , and that the others had found only false ones .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 6]: Plainly the situation was desperate .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 11]: We were cold and stiff and the horses were tired .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 13]: We decided to build a sage-brush fire and camp out till morning .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 33]: This was wise , because if we were wandering from the right road and the snow-storm continued another day our case would be the next thing to hopeless if we kept on .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 25]: All agreed that a camp fire was what would come nearest to saving us , now , and so we set about building it .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 17]: We could find no matches , and so we tried to make shift with the pistols .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 90]: Not a man in the party had ever tried to do such a thing before , but not a man in the party doubted that it could be done , and without any trouble -- because every man in the party had read about it in books many a time and had naturally come to believe it , with trusting simplicity , just as he had long ago accepted and believed that other common book-fraud about Indians and lost hunters making a fire by rubbing two dry sticks together .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 50]: We huddled together on our knees in the deep snow , and the horses put their noses together and bowed their patient heads over us ; and while the feathery flakes eddied down and turned us into a group of white statuary , we proceeded with the momentous experiment .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 22]: We broke twigs from a sage bush and piled them on a little cleared place in the shelter of our bodies .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 45]: In the course of ten or fifteen minutes all was ready , and then , while conversation ceased and our pulses beat low with anxious suspense , Ollendorff applied his revolver , pulled the trigger and blew the pile clear out of the county !
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 9]: It was the flattest failure that ever was .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 17]: This was distressing , but it paled before a greater horror -- the horses were gone !
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 34]: I had been appointed to hold the bridles , but in my absorbing anxiety over the pistol experiment I had unconsciously dropped them and the released animals had walked off in the storm .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 32]: It was useless to try to follow them , for their footfalls could make no sound , and one could pass within two yards of the creatures and never see them .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 35]: We gave them up without an effort at recovering them , and cursed the lying books that said horses would stay by their masters for protection and companionship in a distressful time like ours .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 15]: We were miserable enough , before ; we felt still more forlorn , now .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 25]: Patiently , but with blighted hope , we broke more sticks and piled them , and once more the Prussian shot them into annihilation .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 42]: Plainly , to light a fire with a pistol was an art requiring practice and experience , and the middle of a desert at midnight in a snow-storm was not a good place or time for the acquiring of the accomplishment .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 9]: We gave it up and tried the other .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 14]: Each man took a couple of sticks and fell to chafing them together .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 18]: At the end of half an hour we were thoroughly chilled , and so were the sticks .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 30]: We bitterly execrated the Indians , the hunters and the books that had betrayed us with the silly device , and wondered dismally what was next to be done .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 18]: At this critical moment Mr. Ballou fished out four matches from the rubbish of an overlooked pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 18]: To have found four gold bars would have seemed poor and cheap good luck compared to this .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 26]: One can not think how good a match looks under such circumstances -- or how lovable and precious , and sacredly beautiful to the eye .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 37]: This time we gathered sticks with high hopes ; and when Mr. Ballou prepared to light the first match , there was an amount of interest centred upon him that pages of writing could not describe .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 12]: The match burned hopefully a moment , and then went out .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 17]: It could not have carried more regret with it if it had been a human life .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 8]: The next match simply flashed and died .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 18]: The wind puffed the third one out just as it was on the imminent verge of success .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 28]: We gathered together closer than ever , and developed a solicitude that was rapt and painful , as Mr. Ballou scratched our last hope on his leg .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 16]: It lit , burned blue and sickly , and then budded into a robust flame .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 34]: Shading it with his hands , the old gentleman bent gradually down and every heart went with him -- everybody , too , for that matter -- and blood and breath stood still .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 42]: The flame touched the sticks at last , took gradual hold upon them -- hesitated -- took a stronger hold -- hesitated again -- held its breath five heart-breaking seconds , then gave a sort of human gasp and went out .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 8]: Nobody said a word for several minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 31]: It was a solemn sort of silence ; even the wind put on a stealthy , sinister quiet , and made no more noise than the falling flakes of snow .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 30]: Finally a sad-voiced conversation began , and it was soon apparent that in each of our hearts lay the conviction that this was our last night with the living .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 14]: I had so hoped that I was the only one who felt so .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 15]: When the others calmly acknowledged their conviction , it sounded like the summons itself .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 11]: Ollendorff said : `` Brothers , let us die together .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 12]: And let us go without one hard feeling towards each other .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 7]: Let us forget and forgive bygones .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 38]: I know that you have felt hard towards me for turning over the canoe , and for knowing too much and leading you round and round in the snow -- but I meant well ; forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 86]: I acknowledge freely that I have had hard feelings against Mr. Ballou for abusing me and calling me a logarythm , which is a thing I do not know what , but no doubt a thing considered disgraceful and unbecoming in America , and it has scarcely been out of my mind and has hurt me a great deal -- but let it go ; I forgive Mr. Ballou with all my heart , and -- '' Poor Ollendorff broke down and the tears came .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 17]: He was not alone , for I was crying too , and so was Mr. Ballou .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 16]: Ollendorff got his voice again and forgave me for things I had done and said .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 23]: Then he got out his bottle of whisky and said that whether he lived or died he would never touch another drop .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 107]: He said he had given up all hope of life , and although ill-prepared , was ready to submit humbly to his fate ; that he wished he could be spared a little longer , not for any selfish reason , but to make a thorough reform in his character , and by devoting himself to helping the poor , nursing the sick , and pleading with the people to guard themselves against the evils of intemperance , make his life a beneficent example to the young , and lay it down at last with the precious reflection that it had not been lived in vain .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 51]: He ended by saying that his reform should begin at this moment , even here in the presence of death , since no longer time was to be vouchsafed wherein to prosecute it to men 's help and benefit -- and with that he threw away the bottle of whisky .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 40]: Mr. Ballou made remarks of similar purport , and began the reform he could not live to continue , by throwing away the ancient pack of cards that had solaced our captivity during the flood and made it bearable .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 36]: He said he never gambled , but still was satisfied that the meddling with cards in any way was immoral and injurious , and no man could be wholly pure and blemishless without eschewing them .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 31]: `` And therefore , '' continued he , `` in doing this act I already feel more in sympathy with that spiritual saturnalia necessary to entire and obsolete reform . ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 26]: These rolling syllables touched him as no intelligible eloquence could have done , and the old man sobbed with a mournfulness not unmingled with satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 28]: My own remarks were of the same tenor as those of my comrades , and I know that the feelings that prompted them were heartfelt and sincere .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 24]: We were all sincere , and all deeply moved and earnest , for we were in the presence of death and without hope .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 34]: I threw away my pipe , and in doing it felt that at last I was free of a hated vice and one that had ridden me like a tyrant all my days .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 58]: While I yet talked , the thought of the good I might have done in the world and the still greater good I might now do , with these new incentives and higher and better aims to guide me if I could only be spared a few years longer , overcame me and the tears came again .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 20]: We put our arms about each other 's necks and awaited the warning drowsiness that precedes death by freezing .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 17]: It came stealing over us presently , and then we bade each other a last farewell .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 23]: A delicious dreaminess wrought its web about my yielding senses , while the snow-flakes wove a winding sheet about my conquered body .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 3]: Oblivion came .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 7]: The battle of life was done .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 20]: I do not know how long I was in a state of forgetfulness , but it seemed an age .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 26]: A vague consciousness grew upon me by degrees , and then came a gathering anguish of pain in my limbs and through all my body .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 3]: I shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 18]: The thought flitted through my brain , `` this is death -- this is the hereafter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 31]: Then came a white upheaval at my side , and a voice said , with bitterness : `` Will some gentleman be so good as to kick me behind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 22]: It was Ballou -- at least it was a towzled snow image in a sitting posture , with Ballou 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 38]: I rose up , and there in the gray dawn , not fifteen steps from us , were the frame buildings of a stage station , and under a shed stood our still saddled and bridled horses !
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 30]: An arched snow-drift broke up , now , and Ollendorff emerged from it , and the three of us sat and stared at the houses without speaking a word .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 7]: We really had nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 39]: We were like the profane man who could not `` do the subject justice , '' the whole situation was so painfully ridiculous and humiliating that words were tame and we did not know where to commence anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 16]: The joy in our hearts at our deliverance was poisoned ; well-nigh dissipated , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 60]: We presently began to grow pettish by degrees , and sullen ; and then , angry at each other , angry at ourselves , angry at everything in general , we moodily dusted the snow from our clothing and in unsociable single file plowed our way to the horses , unsaddled them , and sought shelter in the station .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 13]: I have scarcely exaggerated a detail of this curious and absurd adventure .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 10]: It occurred almost exactly as I have stated it .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 30]: We actually went into camp in a snow-drift in a desert , at midnight in a storm , forlorn and hopeless , within fifteen steps of a comfortable inn .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 14]: For two hours we sat apart in the station and ruminated in disgust .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 19]: The mystery was gone , now , and it was plain enough why the horses had deserted us .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 32]: Without a doubt they were under that shed a quarter of a minute after they had left us , and they must have overheard and enjoyed all our confessions and lamentations .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 15]: After breakfast we felt better , and the zest of life soon came back .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 16]: The world looked bright again , and existence was as dear to us as ever .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 16]: Presently an uneasiness came over me -- grew upon me -- assailed me without ceasing .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 13]: Alas , my regeneration was not complete -- I wanted to smoke !
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 13]: I resisted with all my strength , but the flesh was weak .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 11]: I wandered away alone and wrestled with myself an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 16]: I recalled my promises of reform and preached to myself persuasively , upbraidingly , exhaustively .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 19]: But it was all vain , I shortly found myself sneaking among the snow-drifts hunting for my pipe .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 18]: I discovered it after a considerable search , and crept away to hide myself and enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 30]: I remained behind the barn a good while , asking myself how I would feel if my braver , stronger , truer comrades should catch me in my degradation .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 21]: At last I lit the pipe , and no human being can feel meaner and baser than I did then .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 11]: I was ashamed of being in my own pitiful company .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 26]: Still dreading discovery , I felt that perhaps the further side of the barn would be somewhat safer , and so I turned the corner .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 40]: As I turned the one corner , smoking , Ollendorff turned the other with his bottle to his lips , and between us sat unconscious Ballou deep in a game of `` solitaire '' with the old greasy cards !
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 6]: Absurdity could go no farther .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 22]: We shook hands and agreed to say no more about `` reform '' and `` examples to the rising generation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 14]: The station we were at was at the verge of the Twenty-six-Mile Desert .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 54]: If we had approached it half an hour earlier the night before , we must have heard men shouting there and firing pistols ; for they were expecting some sheep drovers and their flocks and knew that they would infallibly get lost and wander out of reach of help unless guided by sounds .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 31]: While we remained at the station , three of the drovers arrived , nearly exhausted with their wanderings , but two others of their party were never heard of afterward .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 12]: We reached Carson in due time , and took a rest .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 52]: This rest , together with preparations for the journey to Esmeralda , kept us there a week , and the delay gave us the opportunity to be present at the trial of the great land-slide case of Hyde vs. Morgan -- an episode which is famous in Nevada to this day .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 24]: After a word or two of necessary explanation , I will set down the history of this singular affair just as it transpired .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 49]: The mountains are very high and steep about Carson , Eagle and Washoe Valleys -- very high and very steep , and so when the snow gets to melting off fast in the Spring and the warm surface-earth begins to moisten and soften , the disastrous land-slides commence .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 74]: The reader can not know what a land-slide is , unless he has lived in that country and seen the whole side of a mountain taken off some fine morning and deposited down in the valley , leaving a vast , treeless , unsightly scar upon the mountain 's front to keep the circumstance fresh in his memory all the years that he may go on living within seventy miles of that place .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 20]: General Buncombe was shipped out to Nevada in the invoice of Territorial officers , to be United States Attorney .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 42]: He considered himself a lawyer of parts , and he very much wanted an opportunity to manifest it -- partly for the pure gratification of it and partly because his salary was Territorially meagre -LRB- which is a strong expression -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 43]: Now the older citizens of a new territory look down upon the rest of the world with a calm , benevolent compassion , as long as it keeps out of the way -- when it gets in the way they snub it .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 11]: Sometimes this latter takes the shape of a practical joke .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 27]: One morning Dick Hyde rode furiously up to General Buncombe 's door in Carson city and rushed into his presence without stopping to tie his horse .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 5]: He seemed much excited .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 27]: He told the General that he wanted him to conduct a suit for him and would pay him five hundred dollars if he achieved a victory .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 18]: And then , with violent gestures and a world of profanity , he poured out his grief .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 70]: He said it was pretty well known that for some years he had been farming -LRB- or ranching as the more customary term is -RRB- in Washoe District , and making a successful thing of it , and furthermore it was known that his ranch was situated just in the edge of the valley , and that Tom Morgan owned a ranch immediately above it on the mountain side .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 56]: And now the trouble was , that one of those hated and dreaded land-slides had come and slid Morgan 's ranch , fences , cabins , cattle , barns and everything down on top of his ranch and exactly covered up every single vestige of his property , to a depth of about thirty-eight feet .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 56]: Morgan was in possession and refused to vacate the premises -- said he was occupying his own cabin and not interfering with anybody else 's -- and said the cabin was standing on the same dirt and same ranch it had always stood on , and he would like to see anybody make him vacate .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 53]: `` And when I reminded him , '' said Hyde , weeping , `` that it was on top of my ranch and that he was trespassing , he had the infernal meanness to ask me why did n't I stay on my ranch and hold possession when I see him a-coming !
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 67]: Why did n't I stay on it , the blathering lunatic -- by George , when I heard that racket and looked up that hill it was just like the whole world was a-ripping and a-tearing down that mountain side -- splinters , and cord-wood , thunder and lightning , hail and snow , odds and ends of hay stacks , and awful clouds of dust !
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 47]: -- trees going end over end in the air , rocks as big as a house jumping ` bout a thousand feet high and busting into ten million pieces , cattle turned inside out and a-coming head on with their tails hanging out between their teeth !
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 29]: -- and in the midst of all that wrack and destruction sot that cussed Morgan on his gate-post , a-wondering why I did n't stay and hold possession !
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 23]: Laws bless me , I just took one glimpse , General , and lit out 'n the county in three jumps exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 48]: `` But what grinds me is that that Morgan hangs on there and wo n't move off 'n that ranch -- says it 's his 'n and he 's going to keep it -- likes it better 'n he did when it was higher up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 2]: Mad !
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 38]: Well , I 've been so mad for two days I could n't find my way to town -- been wandering around in the brush in a starving condition -- got anything here to drink , General ?
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 13]: But I 'm here now , and I 'm a-going to law .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 5]: You hear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 21]: Never in all the world , perhaps , were a man 's feelings so outraged as were the General 's .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 19]: He said he had never heard of such high-handed conduct in all his life as this Morgan 's .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 49]: And he said there was no use in going to law -- Morgan had no shadow of right to remain where he was -- nobody in the wide world would uphold him in it , and no lawyer would take his case and no judge listen to it .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 73]: Hyde said that right there was where he was mistaken -- everybody in town sustained Morgan ; Hal Brayton , a very smart lawyer , had taken his case ; the courts being in vacation , it was to be tried before a referee , and ex-Governor Roop had already been appointed to that office and would open his court in a large public hall near the hotel at two that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 5]: The General was amazed .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 21]: He said he had suspected before that the people of that Territory were fools , and now he knew it .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 28]: But he said rest easy , rest easy and collect the witnesses , for the victory was just as certain as if the conflict were already over .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 8]: Hyde wiped away his tears and left .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 57]: At two in the afternoon referee Roop 's Court opened and Roop appeared throned among his sheriffs , the witnesses , and spectators , and wearing upon his face a solemnity so awe-inspiring that some of his fellow-conspirators had misgivings that maybe he had not comprehended , after all , that this was merely a joke .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 24]: An unearthly stillness prevailed , for at the slightest noise the judge uttered sternly the command : `` Order in the Court ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 7]: And the sheriffs promptly echoed it .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 64]: Presently the General elbowed his way through the crowd of spectators , with his arms full of law-books , and on his ears fell an order from the judge which was the first respectful recognition of his high official dignity that had ever saluted them , and it trickled pleasantly through his whole system : `` Way for the United States Attorney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 21]: The witnesses were called -- legislators , high government officers , ranchmen , miners , Indians , Chinamen , negroes .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 26]: Three fourths of them were called by the defendant Morgan , but no matter , their testimony invariably went in favor of the plaintiff Hyde .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 32]: Each new witness only added new testimony to the absurdity of a man 's claiming to own another man 's property because his farm had slid down on top of it .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 26]: Then the Morgan lawyers made their speeches , and seemed to make singularly weak ones -- they did really nothing to help the Morgan cause .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 90]: And now the General , with exultation in his face , got up and made an impassioned effort ; he pounded the table , he banged the law-books , he shouted , and roared , and howled , he quoted from everything and everybody , poetry , sarcasm , statistics , history , pathos , bathos , blasphemy , and wound up with a grand war-whoop for free speech , freedom of the press , free schools , the Glorious Bird of America and the principles of eternal justice !
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 4]: -LSB- Applause . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 40]: When the General sat down , he did it with the conviction that if there was anything in good strong testimony , a great speech and believing and admiring countenances all around , Mr. Morgan 's case was killed .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 23]: Ex-Governor Roop leant his head upon his hand for some minutes , thinking , and the still audience waited for his decision .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 16]: Then he got up and stood erect , with bended head , and thought again .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 23]: Then he walked the floor with long , deliberate strides , his chin in his hand , and still the audience waited .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 30]: At last he returned to his throne , seated himself , and began impressively : `` Gentlemen , I feel the great responsibility that rests upon me this day .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 6]: This is no ordinary case .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 23]: On the contrary it is plain that it is the most solemn and awful that ever man was called upon to decide .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 33]: Gentlemen , I have listened attentively to the evidence , and have perceived that the weight of it , the overwhelming weight of it , is in favor of the plaintiff Hyde .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 33]: I have listened also to the remarks of counsel , with high interest -- and especially will I commend the masterly and irrefutable logic of the distinguished gentleman who represents the plaintiff .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 34]: But gentlemen , let us beware how we allow mere human testimony , human ingenuity in argument and human ideas of equity , to influence us at a moment so solemn as this .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 20]: Gentlemen , it ill becomes us , worms as we are , to meddle with the decrees of Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 26]: It is plain to me that Heaven , in its inscrutable wisdom , has seen fit to move this defendant 's ranch for a purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 10]: We are but creatures , and we must submit .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 76]: If Heaven has chosen to favor the defendant Morgan in this marked and wonderful manner ; and if Heaven , dissatisfied with the position of the Morgan ranch upon the mountain side , has chosen to remove it to a position more eligible and more advantageous for its owner , it ill becomes us , insects as we are , to question the legality of the act or inquire into the reasons that prompted it .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 25]: No -- Heaven created the ranches and it is Heaven 's prerogative to rearrange them , to experiment with them around at its pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 10]: It is for us to submit , without repining .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 28]: `` I warn you that this thing which has happened is a thing with which the sacrilegious hands and brains and tongues of men must not meddle .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 28]: Gentlemen , it is the verdict of this court that the plaintiff , Richard Hyde , has been deprived of his ranch by the visitation of God !
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 10]: And from this decision there is no appeal . ''
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 16]: Buncombe seized his cargo of law-books and plunged out of the court-room frantic with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 13]: He pronounced Roop to be a miraculous fool , an inspired idiot .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 47]: In all good faith he returned at night and remonstrated with Roop upon his extravagant decision , and implored him to walk the floor and think for half an hour , and see if he could not figure out some sort of modification of the verdict .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 10]: Roop yielded at last and got up to walk .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 85]: He walked two hours and a half , and at last his face lit up happily and he told Buncombe it had occurred to him that the ranch underneath the new Morgan ranch still belonged to Hyde , that his title to the ground was just as good as it had ever been , and therefore he was of opinion that Hyde had a right to dig it out from under there and -- The General never waited to hear the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 12]: He was always an impatient and irascible man , that way .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 36]: At the end of two months the fact that he had been played upon with a joke had managed to bore itself , like another Hoosac Tunnel , through the solid adamant of his understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXV .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 29]: When we finally left for Esmeralda , horseback , we had an addition to the company in the person of Capt. John Nye , the Governor 's brother .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 14]: He had a good memory , and a tongue hung in the middle .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 10]: This is a combination which gives immortality to conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 21]: Capt. John never suffered the talk to flag or falter once during the hundred and twenty miles of the journey .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 19]: In addition to his conversational powers , he had one or two other endowments of a marked character .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 44]: One was a singular `` handiness '' about doing anything and everything , from laying out a railroad or organizing a political party , down to sewing on buttons , shoeing a horse , or setting a broken leg , or a hen .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 62]: Another was a spirit of accommodation that prompted him to take the needs , difficulties and perplexities of anybody and everybody upon his own shoulders at any and all times , and dispose of them with admirable facility and alacrity -- hence he always managed to find vacant beds in crowded inns , and plenty to eat in the emptiest larders .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 37]: And finally , wherever he met a man , woman or child , in camp , inn or desert , he either knew such parties personally or had been acquainted with a relative of the same .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 9]: Such another traveling comrade was never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 16]: I can not forbear giving a specimen of the way in which he overcame difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 52]: On the second day out , we arrived , very tired and hungry , at a poor little inn in the desert , and were told that the house was full , no provisions on hand , and neither hay nor barley to spare for the horses -- must move on .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 22]: The rest of us wanted to hurry on while it was yet light , but Capt. John insisted on stopping awhile .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 5]: We dismounted and entered .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 10]: There was no welcome for us on any face .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 137]: Capt. John began his blandishments , and within twenty minutes he had accomplished the following things , viz. : found old acquaintances in three teamsters ; discovered that he used to go to school with the landlord 's mother ; recognized his wife as a lady whose life he had saved once in California , by stopping her runaway horse ; mended a child 's broken toy and won the favor of its mother , a guest of the inn ; helped the hostler bleed a horse , and prescribed for another horse that had the `` heaves '' ; treated the entire party three times at the landlord 's bar ; produced a later paper than anybody had seen for a week and sat himself down to read the news to a deeply interested audience .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 58]: The result , summed up , was as follows : The hostler found plenty of feed for our horses ; we had a trout supper , an exceedingly sociable time after it , good beds to sleep in , and a surprising breakfast in the morning -- and when we left , we left lamented by all !
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 19]: Capt. John had some bad traits , but he had some uncommonly valuable ones to offset them with .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 16]: Esmeralda was in many respects another Humboldt , but in a little more forward state .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 18]: The claims we had been paying assessments on were entirely worthless , and we threw them away .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 35]: The principal one cropped out of the top of a knoll that was fourteen feet high , and the inspired Board of Directors were running a tunnel under that knoll to strike the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 30]: The tunnel would have to be seventy feet long , and would then strike the ledge at the same dept that a shaft twelve feet deep would have reached !
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 10]: The Board were living on the `` assessments . ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 30]: -LSB- N.B. -- This hint comes too late for the enlightenment of New York silver miners ; they have already learned all about this neat trick by experience . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 22]: The Board had no desire to strike the ledge , knowing that it was as barren of silver as a curbstone .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 10]: This reminiscence calls to mind Jim Townsend 's tunnel .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 18]: He had paid assessments on a mine called the `` Daley '' till he was well-nigh penniless .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 30]: Finally an assessment was levied to run a tunnel two hundred and fifty feet on the Daley , and Townsend went up on the hill to look into matters .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 29]: He found the Daley cropping out of the apex of an exceedingly sharp-pointed peak , and a couple of men up there `` facing '' the proposed tunnel .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 5]: Townsend made a calculation .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 32]: Then he said to the men : `` So you have taken a contract to run a tunnel into this hill two hundred and fifty feet to strike this ledge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 28]: `` Well , do you know that you have got one of the most expensive and arduous undertakings before you that was ever conceived by man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 9]: `` Why no -- how is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 33]: `` Because this hill is only twenty-five feet through from side to side ; and so you have got to build two hundred and twenty-five feet of your tunnel on trestle-work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 12]: The ways of silver mining Boards are exceedingly dark and sinuous .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 21]: We took up various claims , and commenced shafts and tunnels on them , but never finished any of them .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 31]: We had to do a certain amount of work on each to `` hold '' it , else other parties could seize our property after the expiration of ten days .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 25]: We were always hunting up new claims and doing a little work on them and then waiting for a buyer -- who never came .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 45]: We never found any ore that would yield more than fifty dollars a ton ; and as the mills charged fifty dollars a ton for working ore and extracting the silver , our pocket-money melted steadily away and none returned to take its place .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 41]: We lived in a little cabin and cooked for ourselves ; and altogether it was a hard life , though a hopeful one -- for we never ceased to expect fortune and a customer to burst upon us some day .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 47]: At last , when flour reached a dollar a pound , and money could not be borrowed on the best security at less than eight per cent a month -LRB- I being without the security , too -RRB- , I abandoned mining and went to milling .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 26]: That is to say , I went to work as a common laborer in a quartz mill , at ten dollars a week and board .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 63]: I had already learned how hard and long and dismal a task it is to burrow down into the bowels of the earth and get out the coveted ore ; and now I learned that the burrowing was only half the work ; and that to get the silver out of the ore was the dreary and laborious other half of it .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 17]: We had to turn out at six in the morning and keep at it till dark .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 11]: This mill was a six-stamp affair , driven by steam .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 64]: Six tall , upright rods of iron , as large as a man 's ankle , and heavily shod with a mass of iron and steel at their lower ends , were framed together like a gate , and these rose and fell , one after the other , in a ponderous dance , in an iron box called a `` battery . ''
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 11]: Each of these rods or stamps weighed six hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 27]: One of us stood by the battery all day long , breaking up masses of silver-bearing rock with a sledge and shoveling it into the battery .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 29]: The ceaseless dance of the stamps pulverized the rock to powder , and a stream of water that trickled into the battery turned it to a creamy paste .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 35]: The minutest particles were driven through a fine wire screen which fitted close around the battery , and were washed into great tubs warmed by super-heated steam -- amalgamating pans , they are called .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 18]: The mass of pulp in the pans was kept constantly stirred up by revolving `` mullers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 51]: A quantity of quicksilver was kept always in the battery , and this seized some of the liberated gold and silver particles and held on to them ; quicksilver was shaken in a fine shower into the pans , also , about every half hour , through a buckskin sack .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 39]: Quantities of coarse salt and sulphate of copper were added , from time to time to assist the amalgamation by destroying base metals which coated the gold and silver and would not let it unite with the quicksilver .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 11]: All these tiresome things we had to attend to constantly .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 21]: Streams of dirty water flowed always from the pans and were carried off in broad wooden troughs to the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 58]: One would not suppose that atoms of gold and silver would float on top of six inches of water , but they did ; and in order to catch them , coarse blankets were laid in the troughs , and little obstructing `` riffles '' charged with quicksilver were placed here and there across the troughs also .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 64]: These riffles had to be cleaned and the blankets washed out every evening , to get their precious accumulations -- and after all this eternity of trouble one third of the silver and gold in a ton of rock would find its way to the end of the troughs in the ravine at last and have to be worked over again some day .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 9]: There is nothing so aggravating as silver milling .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 10]: There never was any idle time in that mill .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 7]: There was always something to do .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 42]: It is a pity that Adam could not have gone straight out of Eden into a quartz mill , in order to understand the full force of his doom to `` earn his bread by the sweat of his brow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 56]: Every now and then , during the day , we had to scoop some pulp out of the pans , and tediously `` wash '' it in a horn spoon -- wash it little by little over the edge till at last nothing was left but some little dull globules of quicksilver in the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 65]: If they were soft and yielding , the pan needed some salt or some sulphate of copper or some other chemical rubbish to assist digestion ; if they were crisp to the touch and would retain a dint , they were freighted with all the silver and gold they could seize and hold , and consequently the pan needed a fresh charge of quicksilver .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 16]: When there was nothing else to do , one could always `` screen tailings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 42]: That is to say , he could shovel up the dried sand that had washed down to the ravine through the troughs and dash it against an upright wire screen to free it from pebbles and prepare it for working over .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 56]: The process of amalgamation differed in the various mills , and this included changes in style of pans and other machinery , and a great diversity of opinion existed as to the best in use , but none of the methods employed , involved the principle of milling ore without `` screening the tailings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 24]: Of all recreations in the world , screening tailings on a hot day , with a long-handled shovel , is the most undesirable .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 17]: At the end of the week the machinery was stopped and we `` cleaned up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 39]: That is to say , we got the pulp out of the pans and batteries , and washed the mud patiently away till nothing was left but the long accumulating mass of quicksilver , with its imprisoned treasures .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 22]: This we made into heavy , compact snow-balls , and piled them up in a bright , luxurious heap for inspection .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 42]: Making these snow-balls cost me a fine gold ring -- that and ignorance together ; for the quicksilver invaded the ring with the same facility with which water saturates a sponge -- separated its particles and the ring crumbled to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 31]: We put our pile of quicksilver balls into an iron retort that had a pipe leading from it to a pail of water , and then applied a roasting heat .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 25]: The quicksilver turned to vapor , escaped through the pipe into the pail , and the water turned it into good wholesome quicksilver again .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 11]: Quicksilver is very costly , and they never waste it .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 31]: On opening the retort , there was our week 's work -- a lump of pure white , frosty looking silver , twice as large as a man 's head .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 31]: Perhaps a fifth of the mass was gold , but the color of it did not show -- would not have shown if two thirds of it had been gold .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 19]: We melted it up and made a solid brick of it by pouring it into an iron brick-mould .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 12]: By such a tedious and laborious process were silver bricks obtained .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 14]: This mill was but one of many others in operation at the time .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 34]: The first one in Nevada was built at Egan Canyon and was a small insignificant affair and compared most unfavorably with some of the immense establishments afterwards located at Virginia City and elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 33]: From our bricks a little corner was chipped off for the `` fire-assay '' -- a method used to determine the proportions of gold , silver and base metals in the mass .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 6]: This is an interesting process .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 57]: The chip is hammered out as thin as paper and weighed on scales so fine and sensitive that if you weigh a two-inch scrap of paper on them and then write your name on the paper with a course , soft pencil and weigh it again , the scales will take marked notice of the addition .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 46]: Then a little lead -LRB- also weighed -RRB- is rolled up with the flake of silver and the two are melted at a great heat in a small vessel called a cupel , made by compressing bone ashes into a cup-shape in a steel mold .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 17]: The base metals oxydize and are absorbed with the lead into the pores of the cupel .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 35]: A button or globule of perfectly pure gold and silver is left behind , and by weighing it and noting the loss , the assayer knows the proportion of base metal the brick contains .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 11]: He has to separate the gold from the silver now .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 63]: The button is hammered out flat and thin , put in the furnace and kept some time at a red heat ; after cooling it off it is rolled up like a quill and heated in a glass vessel containing nitric acid ; the acid dissolves the silver and leaves the gold pure and ready to be weighed on its own merits .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 26]: Then salt water is poured into the vessel containing the dissolved silver and the silver returns to palpable form again and sinks to the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 35]: Nothing now remains but to weigh it ; then the proportions of the several metals contained in the brick are known , and the assayer stamps the value of the brick upon its surface .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 63]: The sagacious reader will know now , without being told , that the speculative miner , in getting a `` fire-assay '' made of a piece of rock from his mine -LRB- to help him sell the same -RRB- , was not in the habit of picking out the least valuable fragment of rock on his dump-pile , but quite the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 45]: I have seen men hunt over a pile of nearly worthless quartz for an hour , and at last find a little piece as large as a filbert , which was rich in gold and silver -- and this was reserved for a fire-assay !
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 30]: Of course the fire-assay would demonstrate that a ton of such rock would yield hundreds of dollars -- and on such assays many an utterly worthless mine was sold .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 24]: Assaying was a good business , and so some men engaged in it , occasionally , who were not strictly scientific and capable .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 25]: One assayer got such rich results out of all specimens brought to him that in time he acquired almost a monopoly of the business .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 17]: But like all men who achieve success , he became an object of envy and suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 27]: The other assayers entered into a conspiracy against him , and let some prominent citizens into the secret in order to show that they meant fairly .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 27]: Then they broke a little fragment off a carpenter 's grindstone and got a stranger to take it to the popular scientist and get it assayed .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 31]: In the course of an hour the result came -- whereby it appeared that a ton of that rock would yield $ 1,184.40 in silver and $ 366.36 in gold !
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 24]: Due publication of the whole matter was made in the paper , and the popular assayer left town `` between two days . ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 18]: I will remark , in passing , that I only remained in the milling business one week .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 94]: I told my employer I could not stay longer without an advance in my wages ; that I liked quartz milling , indeed was infatuated with it ; that I had never before grown so tenderly attached to an occupation in so short a time ; that nothing , it seemed to me , gave such scope to intellectual activity as feeding a battery and screening tailings , and nothing so stimulated the moral attributes as retorting bullion and washing blankets -- still , I felt constrained to ask an increase of salary .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 19]: He said he was paying me ten dollars a week , and thought it a good round sum .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 6]: How much did I want ?
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 26]: I said about four hundred thousand dollars a month , and board , was about all I could reasonably ask , considering the hard times .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 7]: I was ordered off the premises !
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 39]: And yet , when I look back to those days and call to mind the exceeding hardness of the labor I performed in that mill , I only regret that I did not ask him seven hundred thousand .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 48]: Shortly after this I began to grow crazy , along with the rest of the population , about the mysterious and wonderful `` cement mine , '' and to make preparations to take advantage of any opportunity that might offer to go and help hunt for it .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVII .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 20]: It was somewhere in the neighborhood of Mono Lake that the marvellous Whiteman cement mine was supposed to lie .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 52]: Every now and then it would be reported that Mr. W. had passed stealthily through Esmeralda at dead of night , in disguise , and then we would have a wild excitement -- because he must be steering for his secret mine , and now was the time to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 43]: In less than three hours after daylight all the horses and mules and donkeys in the vicinity would be bought , hired or stolen , and half the community would be off for the mountains , following in the wake of Whiteman .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 38]: But W. would drift about through the mountain gorges for days together , in a purposeless sort of way , until the provisions of the miners ran out , and they would have to go back home .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 42]: I have known it reported at eleven at night , in a large mining camp , that Whiteman had just passed through , and in two hours the streets , so quiet before , would be swarming with men and animals .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 25]: Every individual would be trying to be very secret , but yet venturing to whisper to just one neighbor that W. had passed through .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 31]: And long before daylight -- this in the dead of Winter -- the stampede would be complete , the camp deserted , and the whole population gone chasing after W .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 64]: The tradition was that in the early immigration , more than twenty years ago , three young Germans , brothers , who had survived an Indian massacre on the Plains , wandered on foot through the deserts , avoiding all trails and roads , and simply holding a westerly direction and hoping to find California before they starved , or died of fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 39]: And in a gorge in the mountains they sat down to rest one day , when one of them noticed a curious vein of cement running along the ground , shot full of lumps of dull yellow metal .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 21]: They saw that it was gold , and that here was a fortune to be acquired in a single day .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 20]: The vein was about as wide as a curbstone , and fully two thirds of it was pure gold .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 12]: Every pound of the wonderful cement was worth well-nigh $ 200 .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 44]: Each of the brothers loaded himself with about twenty-five pounds of it , and then they covered up all traces of the vein , made a rude drawing of the locality and the principal landmarks in the vicinity , and started westward again .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 6]: But troubles thickened about them .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 28]: In their wanderings one brother fell and broke his leg , and the others were obliged to go on and leave him to die in the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 48]: Another , worn out and starving , gave up by and by , and laid down to die , but after two or three weeks of incredible hardships , the third reached the settlements of California exhausted , sick , and his mind deranged by his sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 23]: He had thrown away all his cement but a few fragments , but these were sufficient to set everybody wild with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 22]: However , he had had enough of the cement country , and nothing could induce him to lead a party thither .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 12]: He was entirely content to work on a farm for wages .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 63]: But he gave Whiteman his map , and described the cement region as well as he could and thus transferred the curse to that gentleman -- for when I had my one accidental glimpse of Mr. W. in Esmeralda he had been hunting for the lost mine , in hunger and thirst , poverty and sickness , for twelve or thirteen years .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 16]: Some people believed he had found it , but most people believed he had not .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 33]: I saw a piece of cement as large as my fist which was said to have been given to Whiteman by the young German , and it was of a seductive nature .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 18]: Lumps of virgin gold were as thick in it as raisins in a slice of fruit cake .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 19]: The privilege of working such a mine one week would be sufficient for a man of reasonable desires .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 62]: A new partner of ours , a Mr. Higbie , knew Whiteman well by sight , and a friend of ours , a Mr. Van Dorn , was well acquainted with him , and not only that , but had Whiteman 's promise that he should have a private hint in time to enable him to join the next cement expedition .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 11]: Van Dorn had promised to extend the hint to us .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 30]: One evening Higbie came in greatly excited , and said he felt certain he had recognized Whiteman , up town , disguised and in a pretended state of intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 31]: In a little while Van Dorn arrived and confirmed the news ; and so we gathered in our cabin and with heads close together arranged our plans in impressive whispers .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 43]: We were to leave town quietly , after midnight , in two or three small parties , so as not to attract attention , and meet at dawn on the `` divide '' overlooking Mono Lake , eight or nine miles distant .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 19]: We were to make no noise after starting , and not speak above a whisper under any circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 19]: It was believed that for once Whiteman 's presence was unknown in the town and his expedition unsuspected .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 20]: Our conclave broke up at nine o'clock , and we set about our preparation diligently and with profound secrecy .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 67]: At eleven o'clock we saddled our horses , hitched them with their long riatas -LRB- or lassos -RRB- , and then brought out a side of bacon , a sack of beans , a small sack of coffee , some sugar , a hundred pounds of flour in sacks , some tin cups and a coffee pot , frying pan and some few other necessary articles .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 44]: All these things were `` packed '' on the back of a led horse -- and whoever has not been taught , by a Spanish adept , to pack an animal , let him never hope to do the thing by natural smartness .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 4]: That is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 11]: Higbie had had some experience , but was not perfect .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 83]: He put on the pack saddle -LRB- a thing like a saw-buck -RRB- , piled the property on it and then wound a rope all over and about it and under it , `` every which way , '' taking a hitch in it every now and then , and occasionally surging back on it till the horse 's sides sunk in and he gasped for breath -- but every time the lashings grew tight in one place they loosened in another .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 41]: We never did get the load tight all over , but we got it so that it would do , after a fashion , and then we started , in single file , close order , and without a word .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 6]: It was a dark night .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 42]: We kept the middle of the road , and proceeded in a slow walk past the rows of cabins , and whenever a miner came to his door I trembled for fear the light would shine on us an excite curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 4]: But nothing happened .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 52]: We began the long winding ascent of the canyon , toward the `` divide , '' and presently the cabins began to grow infrequent , and the intervals between them wider and wider , and then I began to breathe tolerably freely and feel less like a thief and a murderer .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 11]: I was in the rear , leading the pack horse .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 27]: As the ascent grew steeper he grew proportionately less satisfied with his cargo , and began to pull back on his riata occasionally and delay progress .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 11]: My comrades were passing out of sight in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 5]: I was getting anxious .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 33]: I coaxed and bullied the pack horse till I presently got him into a trot , and then the tin cups and pans strung about his person frightened him and he ran .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 34]: His riata was wound around the pummel of my saddle , and so , as he went by he dragged me from my horse and the two animals traveled briskly on without me .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 21]: But I was not alone -- the loosened cargo tumbled overboard from the pack horse and fell close to me .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 9]: It was abreast of almost the last cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 11]: A miner came out and said : `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 27]: I was thirty steps from him , and knew he could not see me , it was so very dark in the shadow of the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 5]: So I lay still .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 20]: Another head appeared in the light of the cabin door , and presently the two men walked toward me .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 15]: They stopped within ten steps of me , and one said : `` Sh !
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 3]: Listen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 23]: I could not have been in a more distressed state if I had been escaping justice with a price on my head .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 27]: Then the miners appeared to sit down on a boulder , though I could not see them distinctly enough to be very sure what they did .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 17]: One said : `` I heard a noise , as plain as I ever heard anything .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 15]: It seemed to be about there -- '' A stone whizzed by my head .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 31]: I flattened myself out in the dust like a postage stamp , and thought to myself if he mended his aim ever so little he would probably hear another noise .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 11]: In my heart , now , I execrated secret expeditions .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 19]: I promised myself that this should be my last , though the Sierras were ribbed with cement veins .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 14]: Then one of the men said : `` I 'll tell you what !
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 15]: Welch knew what he was talking about when he said he saw Whiteman to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 9]: I heard horses -- that was the noise .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 12]: I am going down to Welch 's , right away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 7]: They left and I was glad .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 12]: I did not care whither they went , so they went .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 14]: I was willing they should visit Welch , and the sooner the better .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 29]: As soon as they closed their cabin door my comrades emerged from the gloom ; they had caught the horses and were waiting for a clear coast again .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 28]: We remounted the cargo on the pack horse and got under way , and as day broke we reached the `` divide '' and joined Van Dorn .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 30]: Then we journeyed down into the valley of the Lake , and feeling secure , we halted to cook breakfast , for we were tired and sleepy and hungry .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 32]: Three hours later the rest of the population filed over the `` divide '' in a long procession , and drifted off out of sight around the borders of the Lake !
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 40]: Whether or not my accident had produced this result we never knew , but at least one thing was certain -- the secret was out and Whiteman would not enter upon a search for the cement mine this time .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 6]: We were filled with chagrin .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 27]: We held a council and decided to make the best of our misfortune and enjoy a week 's holiday on the borders of the curious Lake .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 17]: Mono , it is sometimes called , and sometimes the `` Dead Sea of California . ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 69]: It is one of the strangest freaks of Nature to be found in any land , but it is hardly ever mentioned in print and very seldom visited , because it lies away off the usual routes of travel and besides is so difficult to get at that only men content to endure the roughest life will consent to take upon themselves the discomforts of such a trip .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 48]: On the morning of our second day , we traveled around to a remote and particularly wild spot on the borders of the Lake , where a stream of fresh , ice-cold water entered it from the mountain side , and then we went regularly into camp .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 28]: We hired a large boat and two shot-guns from a lonely ranchman who lived some ten miles further on , and made ready for comfort and recreation .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 13]: We soon got thoroughly acquainted with the Lake and all its peculiarities .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 40]: Mono Lake lies in a lifeless , treeless , hideous desert , eight thousand feet above the level of the sea , and is guarded by mountains two thousand feet higher , whose summits are always clothed in clouds .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 25]: This solemn , silent , sail-less sea -- this lonely tenant of the loneliest spot on earth -- is little graced with the picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 64]: It is an unpretending expanse of grayish water , about a hundred miles in circumference , with two islands in its centre , mere upheavals of rent and scorched and blistered lava , snowed over with gray banks and drifts of pumice-stone and ashes , the winding sheet of the dead volcano , whose vast crater the lake has seized upon and occupied .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 57]: The lake is two hundred feet deep , and its sluggish waters are so strong with alkali that if you only dip the most hopelessly soiled garment into them once or twice , and wring it out , it will be found as clean as if it had been through the ablest of washerwomen 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 10]: While we camped there our laundry work was easy .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 31]: We tied the week 's washing astern of our boat , and sailed a quarter of a mile , and the job was complete , all to the wringing out .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 26]: If we threw the water on our heads and gave them a rub or so , the white lather would pile up three inches high .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 14]: This water is not good for bruised places and abrasions of the skin .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 6]: We had a valuable dog .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 7]: He had raw places on him .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 11]: He had more raw places on him than sound ones .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 10]: He was the rawest dog I almost ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 12]: He jumped overboard one day to get away from the flies .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 6]: But it was bad judgment .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 17]: In his condition , it would have been just as comfortable to jump into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 23]: The alkali water nipped him in all the raw places simultaneously , and he struck out for the shore with considerable interest .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 64]: He yelped and barked and howled as he went -- and by the time he got to the shore there was no bark to him -- for he had barked the bark all out of his inside , and the alkali water had cleaned the bark all off his outside , and he probably wished he had never embarked in any such enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 35]: He ran round and round in a circle , and pawed the earth and clawed the air , and threw double somersaults , sometimes backward and sometimes forward , in the most extraordinary manner .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 36]: He was not a demonstrative dog , as a general thing , but rather of a grave and serious turn of mind , and I never saw him take so much interest in anything before .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 30]: He finally struck out over the mountains , at a gait which we estimated at about two hundred and fifty miles an hour , and he is going yet .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 7]: This was about nine years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 13]: We look for what is left of him along here every day .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 19]: A white man can not drink the water of Mono Lake , for it is nearly pure lye .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 15]: It is said that the Indians in the vicinity drink it sometimes , though .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 16]: It is not improbable , for they are among the purest liars I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 20]: -LSB- There will be no additional charge for this joke , except to parties requiring an explanation of it .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 17]: This joke has received high commendation from some of the ablest minds of the age . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 29]: There are no fish in Mono Lake -- no frogs , no snakes , no polliwigs -- nothing , in fact , that goes to make life desirable .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 48]: Millions of wild ducks and sea-gulls swim about the surface , but no living thing exists under the surface , except a white feathery sort of worm , one half an inch long , which looks like a bit of white thread frayed out at the sides .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 18]: If you dip up a gallon of water , you will get about fifteen thousand of these .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 11]: They give to the water a sort of grayish-white appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 14]: Then there is a fly , which looks something like our house fly .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 51]: These settle on the beach to eat the worms that wash ashore -- and any time , you can see there a belt of flies an inch deep and six feet wide , and this belt extends clear around the lake -- a belt of flies one hundred miles long .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 22]: If you throw a stone among them , they swarm up so thick that they look dense , like a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 25]: You can hold them under water as long as you please -- they do not mind it -- they are only proud of it .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 46]: When you let them go , they pop up to the surface as dry as a patent office report , and walk off as unconcernedly as if they had been educated especially with a view to affording instructive entertainment to man in that particular way .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 8]: Providence leaves nothing to go by chance .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 56]: All things have their uses and their part and proper place in Nature 's economy : the ducks eat the flies -- the flies eat the worms -- the Indians eat all three -- the wild cats eat the Indians -- the white folks eat the wild cats -- and thus all things are lovely .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 45]: Mono Lake is a hundred miles in a straight line from the ocean -- and between it and the ocean are one or two ranges of mountains -- yet thousands of sea-gulls go there every season to lay their eggs and rear their young .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 11]: One would as soon expect to find sea-gulls in Kansas .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 14]: And in this connection let us observe another instance of Nature 's wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 89]: The islands in the lake being merely huge masses of lava , coated over with ashes and pumice-stone , and utterly innocent of vegetation or anything that would burn ; and sea-gull 's eggs being entirely useless to anybody unless they be cooked , Nature has provided an unfailing spring of boiling water on the largest island , and you can put your eggs in there , and in four minutes you can boil them as hard as any statement I have made during the past fifteen years .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 19]: Within ten feet of the boiling spring is a spring of pure cold water , sweet and wholesome .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 69]: So , in that island you get your board and washing free of charge -- and if nature had gone further and furnished a nice American hotel clerk who was crusty and disobliging , and did n't know anything about the time tables , or the railroad routes -- or -- anything -- and was proud of it -- I would not wish for a more desirable boarding-house .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 23]: Half a dozen little mountain brooks flow into Mono Lake , but not a stream of any kind flows out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 23]: It neither rises nor falls , apparently , and what it does with its surplus water is a dark and bloody mystery .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 30]: There are only two seasons in the region round about Mono Lake -- and these are , the breaking up of one Winter and the beginning of the next .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 53]: More than once -LRB- in Esmeralda -RRB- I have seen a perfectly blistering morning open up with the thermometer at ninety degrees at eight o'clock , and seen the snow fall fourteen inches deep and that same identical thermometer go down to forty-four degrees under shelter , before nine o'clock at night .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 23]: Under favorable circumstances it snows at least once in every single month in the year , in the little town of Mono .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 39]: So uncertain is the climate in Summer that a lady who goes out visiting can not hope to be prepared for all emergencies unless she takes her fan under one arm and her snow shoes under the other .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 54]: When they have a Fourth of July procession it generally snows on them , and they do say that as a general thing when a man calls for a brandy toddy there , the bar keeper chops it off with a hatchet and wraps it up in a paper , like maple sugar .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 24]: And it is further reported that the old soakers have n't any teeth -- wore them out eating gin cocktails and brandy punches .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 41]: I do not endorse that statement -- I simply give it for what it is worth -- and it is worth -- well , I should say , millions , to any man who can believe it without straining himself .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 20]: But I do endorse the snow on the Fourth of July -- because I know that to be true .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIX .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 34]: About seven o'clock one blistering hot morning -- for it was now dead summer time -- Higbie and I took the boat and started on a voyage of discovery to the two islands .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 79]: We had often longed to do this , but had been deterred by the fear of storms ; for they were frequent , and severe enough to capsize an ordinary row-boat like ours without great difficulty -- and once capsized , death would ensue in spite of the bravest swimming , for that venomous water would eat a man 's eyes out like fire , and burn him out inside , too , if he shipped a sea .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 47]: It was called twelve miles , straight out to the islands -- a long pull and a warm one -- but the morning was so quiet and sunny , and the lake so smooth and glassy and dead , that we could not resist the temptation .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 33]: So we filled two large tin canteens with water -LRB- since we were not acquainted with the locality of the spring said to exist on the large island -RRB- , and started .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 30]: Higbie 's brawny muscles gave the boat good speed , but by the time we reached our destination we judged that we had pulled nearer fifteen miles than twelve .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 10]: We landed on the big island and went ashore .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 64]: We tried the water in the canteens , now , and found that the sun had spoiled it ; it was so brackish that we could not drink it ; so we poured it out and began a search for the spring -- for thirst augments fast as soon as it is apparent that one has no means at hand of quenching it .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 45]: The island was a long , moderately high hill of ashes -- nothing but gray ashes and pumice-stone , in which we sunk to our knees at every step -- and all around the top was a forbidding wall of scorched and blasted rocks .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 34]: When we reached the top and got within the wall , we found simply a shallow , far-reaching basin , carpeted with ashes , and here and there a patch of fine sand .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 37]: In places , picturesque jets of steam shot up out of crevices , giving evidence that although this ancient crater had gone out of active business , there was still some fire left in its furnaces .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 49]: Close to one of these jets of steam stood the only tree on the island -- a small pine of most graceful shape and most faultless symmetry ; its color was a brilliant green , for the steam drifted unceasingly through its branches and kept them always moist .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 19]: It contrasted strangely enough , did this vigorous and beautiful outcast , with its dead and dismal surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 11]: It was like a cheerful spirit in a mourning household .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 50]: We hunted for the spring everywhere , traversing the full length of the island -LRB- two or three miles -RRB- , and crossing it twice -- climbing ash-hills patiently , and then sliding down the other side in a sitting posture , plowing up smothering volumes of gray dust .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 13]: But we found nothing but solitude , ashes and a heart-breaking silence .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 38]: Finally we noticed that the wind had risen , and we forgot our thirst in a solicitude of greater importance ; for , the lake being quiet , we had not taken pains about securing the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 28]: We hurried back to a point overlooking our landing place , and then -- but mere words can not describe our dismay -- the boat was gone !
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 14]: The chances were that there was not another boat on the entire lake .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 17]: The situation was not comfortable -- in truth , to speak plainly , it was frightful .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 40]: We were prisoners on a desolate island , in aggravating proximity to friends who were for the present helpless to aid us ; and what was still more uncomfortable was the reflection that we had neither food nor water .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 7]: But presently we sighted the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 19]: It was drifting along , leisurely , about fifty yards from shore , tossing in a foamy sea .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 31]: It drifted , and continued to drift , but at the same safe distance from land , and we walked along abreast it and waited for fortune to favor us .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 29]: At the end of an hour it approached a jutting cape , and Higbie ran ahead and posted himself on the utmost verge and prepared for the assault .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 12]: If we failed there , there was no hope for us .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 29]: It was driving gradually shoreward all the time , now ; but whether it was driving fast enough to make the connection or not was the momentous question .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 23]: When it got within thirty steps of Higbie I was so excited that I fancied I could hear my own heart beat .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 63]: When , a little later , it dragged slowly along and seemed about to go by , only one little yard out of reach , it seemed as if my heart stood still ; and when it was exactly abreast him and began to widen away , and he still standing like a watching statue , I knew my heart did stop .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 28]: But when he gave a great spring , the next instant , and lit fairly in the stern , I discharged a war-whoop that woke the solitudes !
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 58]: But it dulled my enthusiasm , presently , when he told me he had not been caring whether the boat came within jumping distance or not , so that it passed within eight or ten yards of him , for he had made up his mind to shut his eyes and mouth and swim that trifling distance .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 12]: Imbecile that I was , I had not thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 11]: It was only a long swim that could be fatal .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 10]: The sea was running high and the storm increasing .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 14]: It was growing late , too -- three or four in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 16]: Whether to venture toward the mainland or not , was a question of some moment .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 26]: But we were so distressed by thirst that we decide to try it , and so Higbie fell to work and I took the steering-oar .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 50]: When we had pulled a mile , laboriously , we were evidently in serious peril , for the storm had greatly augmented ; the billows ran very high and were capped with foaming crests , the heavens were hung with black , and the wind blew with great fury .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 38]: We would have gone back , now , but we did not dare to turn the boat around , because as soon as she got in the trough of the sea she would upset , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 12]: Our only hope lay in keeping her head-on to the seas .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 26]: It was hard work to do this , she plunged so , and so beat and belabored the billows with her rising and falling bows .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 35]: Now and then one of Higbie 's oars would trip on the top of a wave , and the other one would snatch the boat half around in spite of my cumbersome steering apparatus .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 15]: We were drenched by the sprays constantly , and the boat occasionally shipped water .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 37]: By and by , powerful as my comrade was , his great exertions began to tell on him , and he was anxious that I should change places with him till he could rest a little .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 69]: But I told him this was impossible ; for if the steering oar were dropped a moment while we changed , the boat would slue around into the trough of the sea , capsize , and in less than five minutes we would have a hundred gallons of soap-suds in us and be eaten up so quickly that we could not even be present at our own inquest .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 7]: But things can not last always .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 15]: Just as the darkness shut down we came booming into port , head on .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 26]: Higbie dropped his oars to hurrah -- I dropped mine to help -- the sea gave the boat a twist , and over she went !
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 41]: The agony that alkali water inflicts on bruises , chafes and blistered hands , is unspeakable , and nothing but greasing all over will modify it -- but we ate , drank and slept well , that night , notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 66]: In speaking of the peculiarities of Mono Lake , I ought to have mentioned that at intervals all around its shores stand picturesque turret-looking masses and clusters of a whitish , coarse-grained rock that resembles inferior mortar dried hard ; and if one breaks off fragments of this rock he will find perfectly shaped and thoroughly petrified gulls ' eggs deeply imbedded in the mass .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 6]: How did they get there ?
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 33]: I simply state the fact -- for it is a fact -- and leave the geological reader to crack the nut at his leisure and solve the problem after his own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 93]: At the end of a week we adjourned to the Sierras on a fishing excursion , and spent several days in camp under snowy Castle Peak , and fished successfully for trout in a bright , miniature lake whose surface was between ten and eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea ; cooling ourselves during the hot August noons by sitting on snow banks ten feet deep , under whose sheltering edges fine grass and dainty flowers flourished luxuriously ; and at night entertaining ourselves by almost freezing to death .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 27]: Then we returned to Mono Lake , and finding that the cement excitement was over for the present , packed up and went back to Esmeralda .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 17]: Mr. Ballou reconnoitred awhile , and not liking the prospect , set out alone for Humboldt .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 32]: About this time occurred a little incident which has always had a sort of interest to me , from the fact that it came so near `` instigating '' my funeral .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 29]: At a time when an Indian attack had been expected , the citizens hid their gunpowder where it would be safe and yet convenient to hand when wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 44]: A neighbor of ours hid six cans of rifle powder in the bake-oven of an old discarded cooking stove which stood on the open ground near a frame out-house or shed , and from and after that day never thought of it again .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 24]: We hired a half-tamed Indian to do some washing for us , and he took up quarters under the shed with his tub .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 15]: The ancient stove reposed within six feet of him , and before his face .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 34]: Finally it occurred to him that hot water would be better than cold , and he went out and fired up under that forgotten powder magazine and set on a kettle of water .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 7]: Then he returned to his tub .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 38]: I entered the shed presently and threw down some more clothes , and was about to speak to him when the stove blew up with a prodigious crash , and disappeared , leaving not a splinter behind .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 13]: Fragments of it fell in the streets full two hundred yards away .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 45]: Nearly a third of the shed roof over our heads was destroyed , and one of the stove lids , after cutting a small stanchion half in two in front of the Indian , whizzed between us and drove partly through the weather-boarding beyond .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 16]: I was as white as a sheet and as weak as a kitten and speechless .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 14]: But the Indian betrayed no trepidation , no distress , not even discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 24]: He simply stopped washing , leaned forward and surveyed the clean , blank ground a moment , and then remarked : `` Mph !
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 6]: Dam stove heap gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 21]: -- and resumed his scrubbing as placidly as if it were an entirely customary thing for a stove to do .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 18]: I will explain , that `` heap '' is `` Injun-English '' for `` very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 14]: The reader will perceive the exhaustive expressiveness of it in the present instance .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 3]: CHAPTER XL .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 27]: I now come to a curious episode -- the most curious , I think , that had yet accented my slothful , valueless , heedless career .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 38]: Out of a hillside toward the upper end of the town , projected a wall of reddish looking quartz-croppings , the exposed comb of a silver-bearing ledge that extended deep down into the earth , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 13]: It was owned by a company entitled the `` Wide West . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 42]: There was a shaft sixty or seventy feet deep on the under side of the croppings , and everybody was acquainted with the rock that came from it -- and tolerably rich rock it was , too , but nothing extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 77]: I will remark here , that although to the inexperienced stranger all the quartz of a particular `` district '' looks about alike , an old resident of the camp can take a glance at a mixed pile of rock , separate the fragments and tell you which mine each came from , as easily as a confectioner can separate and classify the various kinds and qualities of candy in a mixed heap of the article .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 14]: All at once the town was thrown into a state of extraordinary excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 13]: In mining parlance the Wide West had `` struck it rich ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 39]: Everybody went to see the new developments , and for some days there was such a crowd of people about the Wide West shaft that a stranger would have supposed there was a mass meeting in session there .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 19]: No other topic was discussed but the rich strike , and nobody thought or dreamed about anything else .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 31]: Every man brought away a specimen , ground it up in a hand mortar , washed it out in his horn spoon , and glared speechless upon the marvelous result .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 44]: It was not hard rock , but black , decomposed stuff which could be crumbled in the hand like a baked potato , and when spread out on a paper exhibited a thick sprinkling of gold and particles of `` native '' silver .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 21]: Higbie brought a handful to the cabin , and when he had washed it out his amazement was beyond description .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 6]: Wide West stock soared skywards .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 22]: It was said that repeated offers had been made for it at a thousand dollars a foot , and promptly refused .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 30]: We have all had the `` blues '' -- the mere sky-blues -- but mine were indigo , now -- because I did not own in the Wide West .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 12]: The world seemed hollow to me , and existence a grief .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 14]: I lost my appetite , and ceased to take an interest in anything .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 27]: Still I had to stay , and listen to other people 's rejoicings , because I had no money to get out of the camp with .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 35]: The Wide West company put a stop to the carrying away of `` specimens , '' and well they might , for every handful of the ore was worth a sun of some consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 85]: To show the exceeding value of the ore , I will remark that a sixteen-hundred-pounds parcel of it was sold , just as it lay , at the mouth of the shaft , at one dollar a pound ; and the man who bought it `` packed '' it on mules a hundred and fifty or two hundred miles , over the mountains , to San Francisco , satisfied that it would yield at a rate that would richly compensate him for his trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 28]: The Wide West people also commanded their foreman to refuse any but their own operatives permission to enter the mine at any time or for any purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 25]: I kept up my `` blue '' meditations and Higbie kept up a deal of thinking , too , but of a different sort .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 58]: He puzzled over the `` rock , '' examined it with a glass , inspected it in different lights and from different points of view , and after each experiment delivered himself , in soliloquy , of one and the same unvarying opinion in the same unvarying formula : `` It is not Wide West rock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 24]: He said once or twice that he meant to have a look into the Wide West shaft if he got shot for it .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 18]: I was wretched , and did not care whether he got a look into it or not .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 25]: He failed that day , and tried again at night ; failed again ; got up at dawn and tried , and failed again .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 119]: Then he lay in ambush in the sage brush hour after hour , waiting for the two or three hands to adjourn to the shade of a boulder for dinner ; made a start once , but was premature -- one of the men came back for something ; tried it again , but when almost at the mouth of the shaft , another of the men rose up from behind the boulder as if to reconnoitre , and he dropped on the ground and lay quiet ; presently he crawled on his hands and knees to the mouth of the shaft , gave a quick glance around , then seized the rope and slid down the shaft .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 29]: He disappeared in the gloom of a `` side drift '' just as a head appeared in the mouth of the shaft and somebody shouted `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 7]: -- which he did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 7]: He was not disturbed any more .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 32]: An hour later he entered the cabin , hot , red , and ready to burst with smothered excitement , and exclaimed in a stage whisper : `` I knew it !
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 4]: We are rich !
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 7]: IT 'S A BLIND LEAD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 9]: I thought the very earth reeled under me .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 38]: Doubt -- conviction -- doubt again -- exultation -- hope , amazement , belief , unbelief -- every emotion imaginable swept in wild procession through my heart and brain , and I could not speak a word .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 25]: After a moment or two of this mental fury , I shook myself to rights , and said : `` Say it again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 7]: `` It 's blind lead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 16]: `` Cal , let 's -- let 's burn the house -- or kill somebody !
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 11]: Let 's get out where there 's room to hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 6]: But what is the use ?
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 12]: It is a hundred times too good to be true . ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 11]: `` It 's a blind lead , for a million !
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 14]: -- hanging wall -- foot wall -- clay casings -- everything complete ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 23]: He swung his hat and gave three cheers , and I cast doubt to the winds and chimed in with a will .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 20]: For I was worth a million dollars , and did not care `` whether school kept or not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 7]: But perhaps I ought to explain .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 21]: A `` blind lead '' is a lead or ledge that does not `` crop out '' above the surface .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 32]: A miner does not know where to look for such leads , but they are often stumbled upon by accident in the course of driving a tunnel or sinking a shaft .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 36]: Higbie knew the Wide West rock perfectly well , and the more he had examined the new developments the more he was satisfied that the ore could not have come from the Wide West vein .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 38]: And so had it occurred to him alone , of all the camp , that there was a blind lead down in the shaft , and that even the Wide West people themselves did not suspect it .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 4]: He was right .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 40]: When he went down the shaft , he found that the blind lead held its independent way through the Wide West vein , cutting it diagonally , and that it was enclosed in its own well-defined casing-rocks and clay .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 6]: Hence it was public property .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 27]: Both leads being perfectly well defined , it was easy for any miner to see which one belonged to the Wide West and which did not .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 33]: We thought it well to have a strong friend , and therefore we brought the foreman of the Wide West to our cabin that night and revealed the great surprise to him .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 37]: Higbie said : `` We are going to take possession of this blind lead , record it and establish ownership , and then forbid the Wide West company to take out any more of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 15]: You can not help your company in this matter -- nobody can help them .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 21]: I will go into the shaft with you and prove to your entire satisfaction that it is a blind lead .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 20]: Now we propose to take you in with us , and claim the blind lead in our three names .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 6]: What do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 42]: What could a man say who had an opportunity to simply stretch forth his hand and take possession of a fortune without risk of any kind and without wronging any one or attaching the least taint of dishonor to his name ?
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 9]: He could only say , `` Agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 20]: The notice was put up that night , and duly spread upon the recorder 's books before ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 28]: We claimed two hundred feet each -- six hundred feet in all -- the smallest and compactest organization in the district , and the easiest to manage .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 16]: No one can be so thoughtless as to suppose that we slept , that night .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 24]: Higbie and I went to bed at midnight , but it was only to lie broad awake and think , dream , scheme .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 21]: The floorless , tumble-down cabin was a palace , the ragged gray blankets silk , the furniture rosewood and mahogany .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 37]: Each new splendor that burst out of my visions of the future whirled me bodily over in bed or jerked me to a sitting posture just as if an electric battery had been applied to me .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 12]: We shot fragments of conversation back and forth at each other .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 16]: Once Higbie said : `` When are you going home -- to the States ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 4]: `` To-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 13]: -- with an evolution or two , ending with a sitting position .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 13]: `` Well -- no -- but next month , at furthest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 10]: `` We 'll go in the same steamer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 4]: `` Agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 3]: A pause .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 7]: `` Steamer of the 10th ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 6]: No , the 1st . ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 5]: `` All right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 3]: Another pause .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 9]: `` Where are you going to live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 3]: said Higbie .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 5]: `` San Francisco . ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 6]: `` That 's me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 12]: `` Too high -- too much climbing '' -- from Higbie .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 5]: `` What is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 15]: `` I was thinking of Russian Hill -- building a house up there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 5]: `` Too much climbing ?
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 8]: Sha n't you keep a carriage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 5]: I forgot that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 2]: Pause .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 15]: `` Cal. , what kind of a house are you going to build ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 7]: `` I was thinking about that .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 6]: Three-story and an attic . ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 6]: `` But what kind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 9]: `` Well , I do n't hardly know .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 6]: Brick , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 6]: `` Brick -- bosh . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 6]: What is your idea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 49]: `` Brown stone front -- French plate glass -- billiard-room off the dining-room -- statuary and paintings -- shrubbery and two-acre grass plat -- greenhouse -- iron dog on the front stoop -- gray horses -- landau , and a coachman with a bug on his hat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 4]: A long pause .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 11]: `` Cal. , when are you going to Europe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 10]: `` Well -- I had n't thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 5]: When are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 6]: `` In the Spring . ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 9]: `` Going to be gone all summer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 4]: `` All summer !
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 8]: I shall remain there three years . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 10]: `` No -- but are you in earnest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 6]: `` Indeed I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 8]: `` I will go along too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 8]: `` Why of course you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 11]: `` What part of Europe shall you go to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 4]: `` All parts .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 30]: France , England , Germany -- Spain , Italy , Switzerland , Syria , Greece , Palestine , Arabia , Persia , Egypt -- all over -- everywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 6]: `` I 'm agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 5]: `` All right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 10]: `` Wo n't it be a swell trip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 18]: `` We 'll spend forty or fifty thousand dollars trying to make it one , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 4]: Another long pause .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 26]: `` Higbie , we owe the butcher six dollars , and he has been threatening to stop our -- '' `` Hang the butcher ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 4]: `` Amen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 6]: And so it went on .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 24]: By three o'clock we found it was no use , and so we got up and played cribbage and smoked pipes till sunrise .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 7]: It was my week to cook .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 11]: I always hated cooking -- now , I abhorred it .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 7]: The news was all over town .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 12]: The former excitement was great -- this one was greater still .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 8]: I walked the streets serene and happy .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 18]: Higbie said the foreman had been offered two hundred thousand dollars for his third of the mine .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 14]: I said I would like to see myself selling for any such price .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 5]: My ideas were lofty .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 6]: My figure was a million .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 29]: Still , I honestly believe that if I had been offered it , it would have had no other effect than to make me hold off for more .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 8]: I found abundant enjoyment in being rich .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 20]: A man offered me a three-hundred-dollar horse , and wanted to take my simple , unendorsed note for it .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 21]: That brought the most realizing sense I had yet had that I was actually rich , beyond shadow of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 35]: It was followed by numerous other evidences of a similar nature -- among which I may mention the fact of the butcher leaving us a double supply of meat and saying nothing about money .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 57]: By the laws of the district , the `` locators '' or claimants of a ledge were obliged to do a fair and reasonable amount of work on their new property within ten days after the date of the location , or the property was forfeited , and anybody could go and seize it that chose .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 11]: So we determined to go to work the next day .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 68]: About the middle of the afternoon , as I was coming out of the post office , I met a Mr. Gardiner , who told me that Capt. John Nye was lying dangerously ill at his place -LRB- the `` Nine-Mile Ranch '' -RRB- , and that he and his wife were not able to give him nearly as much care and attention as his case demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 22]: I said if he would wait for me a moment , I would go down and help in the sick room .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 9]: I ran to the cabin to tell Higbie .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 29]: He was not there , but I left a note on the table for him , and a few minutes later I left town in Gardiner 's wagon .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLI .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 11]: Captain Nye was very ill indeed , with spasmodic rheumatism .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 32]: But the old gentleman was himself -- which is to say , he was kind-hearted and agreeable when comfortable , but a singularly violent wild-cat when things did not go well .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 31]: He would be smiling along pleasantly enough , when a sudden spasm of his disease would take him and he would go out of his smile into a perfect fury .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 32]: He would groan and wail and howl with the anguish , and fill up the odd chinks with the most elaborate profanity that strong convictions and a fine fancy could contrive .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 36]: With fair opportunity he could swear very well and handle his adjectives with considerable judgment ; but when the spasm was on him it was painful to listen to him , he was so awkward .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 41]: However , I had seen him nurse a sick man himself and put up patiently with the inconveniences of the situation , and consequently I was willing that he should have full license now that his own turn had come .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 39]: He could not disturb me , with all his raving and ranting , for my mind had work on hand , and it labored on diligently , night and day , whether my hands were idle or employed .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 235]: I was altering and amending the plans for my house , and thinking over the propriety of having the billard-room in the attic , instead of on the same floor with the dining-room ; also , I was trying to decide between green and blue for the upholstery of the drawing-room , for , although my preference was blue I feared it was a color that would be too easily damaged by dust and sunlight ; likewise while I was content to put the coachman in a modest livery , I was uncertain about a footman -- I needed one , and was even resolved to have one , but wished he could properly appear and perform his functions out of livery , for I somewhat dreaded so much show ; and yet , inasmuch as my late grandfather had had a coachman and such things , but no liveries , I felt rather drawn to beat him ; -- or beat his ghost , at any rate ; I was also systematizing the European trip , and managed to get it all laid out , as to route and length of time to be devoted to it -- everything , with one exception -- namely , whether to cross the desert from Cairo to Jerusalem per camel , or go by sea to Beirut , and thence down through the country per caravan .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 84]: Meantime I was writing to the friends at home every day , instructing them concerning all my plans and intentions , and directing them to look up a handsome homestead for my mother and agree upon a price for it against my coming , and also directing them to sell my share of the Tennessee land and tender the proceeds to the widows ' and orphans ' fund of the typographical union of which I had long been a member in good standing .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 39]: -LSB- This Tennessee land had been in the possession of the family many years , and promised to confer high fortune upon us some day ; it still promises it , but in a less violent way . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 18]: When I had been nursing the Captain nine days he was somewhat better , but very feeble .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 28]: During the afternoon we lifted him into a chair and gave him an alcoholic vapor bath , and then set about putting him on the bed again .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 14]: We had to be exceedingly careful , for the least jar produced pain .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 29]: Gardiner had his shoulders and I his legs ; in an unfortunate moment I stumbled and the patient fell heavily on the bed in an agony of torture .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 11]: I never heard a man swear so in my life .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 21]: He raved like a maniac , and tried to snatch a revolver from the table -- but I got it .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 31]: He ordered me out of the house , and swore a world of oaths that he would kill me wherever he caught me when he got on his feet again .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 11]: It was simply a passing fury , and meant nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 30]: I knew he would forget it in an hour , and maybe be sorry for it , too ; but it angered me a little , at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 15]: So much so , indeed , that I determined to go back to Esmeralda .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 20]: I thought he was able to get along alone , now , since he was on the war path .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 20]: I took supper , and as soon as the moon rose , began my nine-mile journey , on foot .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 18]: Even millionaires needed no horses , in those days , for a mere nine-mile jaunt without baggage .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 18]: As I `` raised the hill '' overlooking the town , it lacked fifteen minutes of twelve .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 36]: I glanced at the hill over beyond the canyon , and in the bright moonlight saw what appeared to be about half the population of the village massed on and around the Wide West croppings .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 33]: My heart gave an exulting bound , and I said to myself , `` They have made a new strike to-night -- and struck it richer than ever , no doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 10]: I started over there , but gave it up .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 19]: I said the `` strick '' would keep , and I had climbed hill enough for one night .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 32]: I went on down through the town , and as I was passing a little German bakery , a woman ran out and begged me to come in and help her .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 8]: She said her husband had a fit .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 23]: I went in , and judged she was right -- he appeared to have a hundred of them , compressed into one .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 20]: Two Germans were there , trying to hold him , and not making much of a success of it .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 54]: I ran up the street half a block or so and routed out a sleeping doctor , brought him down half dressed , and we four wrestled with the maniac , and doctored , drenched and bled him , for more than an hour , and the poor German woman did the crying .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 19]: He grew quiet , now , and the doctor and I withdrew and left him to his friends .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 8]: It was a little after one o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 48]: As I entered the cabin door , tired but jolly , the dingy light of a tallow candle revealed Higbie , sitting by the pine table gazing stupidly at my note , which he held in his fingers , and looking pale , old , and haggard .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 8]: I halted , and looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 7]: He looked at me , stolidly .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 13]: I said : `` Higbie , what -- what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 19]: `` We 're ruined -- we did n't do the work -- THE BLIND LEAD 'S RELOCATED ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 4]: It was enough .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 11]: I sat down sick , grieved -- broken-hearted , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 22]: A minute before , I was rich and brimful of vanity ; I was a pauper now , and very meek .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 42]: We sat still an hour , busy with thought , busy with vain and useless self-upbraidings , busy with `` Why did n't I do this , and why did n't I do that , '' but neither spoke a word .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 14]: Then we dropped into mutual explanations , and the mystery was cleared away .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 26]: It came out that Higbie had depended on me , as I had on him , and as both of us had on the foreman .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 5]: The folly of it !
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 31]: It was the first time that ever staid and steadfast Higbie had left an important matter to chance or failed to be true to his full share of a responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 33]: But he had never seen my note till this moment , and this moment was the first time he had been in the cabin since the day he had seen me last .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 51]: He , also , had left a note for me , on that same fatal afternoon -- had ridden up on horseback , and looked through the window , and being in a hurry and not seeing me , had tossed the note into the cabin through a broken pane .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 31]: Here it was , on the floor , where it had remained undisturbed for nine days : `` Do n't fail to do the work before the ten days expire .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 9]: W. has passed through and given me notice .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 18]: I am to join him at Mono Lake , and we shall go on from there to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 11]: He says he will find it this time , sure .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 3]: CAL . ''
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 9]: `` W. '' meant Whiteman , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 7]: That thrice accursed `` cement ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 7]: That was the way of it .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 36]: An old miner , like Higbie , could no more withstand the fascination of a mysterious mining excitement like this `` cement '' foolishness , than he could refrain from eating when he was famishing .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 42]: Higbie had been dreaming about the marvelous cement for months ; and now , against his better judgment , he had gone off and `` taken the chances '' on my keeping secure a mine worth a million undiscovered cement veins .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 8]: They had not been followed this time .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 23]: His riding out of town in broad daylight was such a common-place thing to do that it had not attracted any attention .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 26]: He said they prosecuted their search in the fastnesses of the mountains during nine days , without success ; they could not find the cement .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 46]: Then a ghastly fear came over him that something might have happened to prevent the doing of the necessary work to hold the blind lead -LRB- though indeed he thought such a thing hardly possible -RRB- , and forthwith he started home with all speed .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 25]: He would have reached Esmeralda in time , but his horse broke down and he had to walk a great part of the distance .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 20]: And so it happened that as he came into Esmeralda by one road , I entered it by another .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 38]: His was the superior energy , however , for he went straight to the Wide West , instead of turning aside as I had done -- and he arrived there about five or ten minutes too late !
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 25]: The `` notice '' was already up , the `` relocation '' of our mine completed beyond recall , and the crowd rapidly dispersing .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 10]: He learned some facts before he left the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 37]: The foreman had not been seen about the streets since the night we had located the mine -- a telegram had called him to California on a matter of life and death , it was said .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 22]: At any rate he had done no work and the watchful eyes of the community were taking note of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 32]: At midnight of this woful tenth day , the ledge would be `` relocatable , '' and by eleven o'clock the hill was black with men prepared to do the relocating .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 24]: That was the crowd I had seen when I fancied a new `` strike '' had been made -- idiot that I was .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 23]: -LSB- We three had the same right to relocate the lead that other people had , provided we were quick enough . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 42]: As midnight was announced , fourteen men , duly armed and ready to back their proceedings , put up their `` notice '' and proclaimed their ownership of the blind lead , under the new name of the `` Johnson . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 50]: But A. D. Allen our partner -LRB- the foreman -RRB- put in a sudden appearance about that time , with a cocked revolver in his hand , and said his name must be added to the list , or he would `` thin out the Johnson company some . ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 27]: He was a manly , splendid , determined fellow , and known to be as good as his word , and therefore a compromise was effected .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 20]: They put in his name for a hundred feet , reserving to themselves the customary two hundred feet each .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 21]: Such was the history of the night 's events , as Higbie gathered from a friend on the way home .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 42]: Higbie and I cleared out on a new mining excitement the next morning , glad to get away from the scene of our sufferings , and after a month or two of hardship and disappointment , returned to Esmeralda once more .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 66]: Then we learned that the Wide West and the Johnson companies had consolidated ; that the stock , thus united , comprised five thousand feet , or shares ; that the foreman , apprehending tiresome litigation , and considering such a huge concern unwieldy , had sold his hundred feet for ninety thousand dollars in gold and gone home to the States to enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 39]: If the stock was worth such a gallant figure , with five thousand shares in the corporation , it makes me dizzy to think what it would have been worth with only our original six hundred in it .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 17]: It was the difference between six hundred men owning a house and five thousand owning it .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 26]: We would have been millionaires if we had only worked with pick and spade one little day on our property and so secured our ownership !
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 38]: It reads like a wild fancy sketch , but the evidence of many witnesses , and likewise that of the official records of Esmeralda District , is easily obtainable in proof that it is a true history .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 24]: I can always have it to say that I was absolutely and unquestionably worth a million dollars , once , for ten days .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 68]: A year ago my esteemed and in every way estimable old millionaire partner , Higbie , wrote me from an obscure little mining camp in California that after nine or ten years of buffetings and hard striving , he was at last in a position where he could command twenty-five hundred dollars , and said he meant to go into the fruit business in a modest way .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 26]: How such a thought would have insulted him the night we lay in our cabin planning European trips and brown stone houses on Russian Hill !
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLII .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 5]: What to do next ?
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 6]: It was a momentous question .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 67]: I had gone out into the world to shift for myself , at the age of thirteen -LRB- for my father had endorsed for friends ; and although he left us a sumptuous legacy of pride in his fine Virginian stock and its national distinction , I presently found that I could not live on that alone without occasional bread to wash it down with -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 51]: I had gained a livelihood in various vocations , but had not dazzled anybody with my successes ; still the list was before me , and the amplest liberty in the matter of choosing , provided I wanted to work -- which I did not , after being so wealthy .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 46]: I had once been a grocery clerk , for one day , but had consumed so much sugar in that time that I was relieved from further duty by the proprietor ; said he wanted me outside , so that he could have my custom .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 21]: I had studied law an entire week , and then given it up because it was so prosy and tiresome .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 46]: I had engaged briefly in the study of blacksmithing , but wasted so much time trying to fix the bellows so that it would blow itself , that the master turned me adrift in disgrace , and told me I would come to no good .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 42]: I had been a bookseller 's clerk for awhile , but the customers bothered me so much I could not read with any comfort , and so the proprietor gave me a furlough and forgot to put a limit to it .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 30]: I had clerked in a drug store part of a summer , but my prescriptions were unlucky , and we appeared to sell more stomach pumps than soda water .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 6]: So I had to go .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 30]: I had made of myself a tolerable printer , under the impression that I would be another Franklin some day , but somehow had missed the connection thus far .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 65]: There was no berth open in the Esmeralda Union , and besides I had always been such a slow compositor that I looked with envy upon the achievements of apprentices of two years ' standing ; and when I took a `` take , '' foremen were in the habit of suggesting that it would be wanted `` some time during the year . ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 117]: I was a good average St. Louis and New Orleans pilot and by no means ashamed of my abilities in that line ; wages were two hundred and fifty dollars a month and no board to pay , and I did long to stand behind a wheel again and never roam any more -- but I had been making such an ass of myself lately in grandiloquent letters home about my blind lead and my European excursion that I did what many and many a poor disappointed miner had done before ; said `` It is all over with me now , and I will never go back home to be pitied -- and snubbed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 33]: I had been a private secretary , a silver miner and a silver mill operative , and amounted to less than nothing in each , and now -- What to do next ?
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 15]: I yielded to Higbie 's appeals and consented to try the mining once more .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 29]: We climbed far up on the mountain side and went to work on a little rubbishy claim of ours that had a shaft on it eight feet deep .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 45]: Higbie descended into it and worked bravely with his pick till he had loosened up a deal of rock and dirt and then I went down with a long-handled shovel -LRB- the most awkward invention yet contrived by man -RRB- to throw it out .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 33]: You must brace the shovel forward with the side of your knee till it is full , and then , with a skilful toss , throw it backward over your left shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 32]: I made the toss , and landed the mess just on the edge of the shaft and it all came back on my head and down the back of my neck .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 13]: I never said a word , but climbed out and walked home .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 25]: I inwardly resolved that I would starve before I would make a target of myself and shoot rubbish at it with a long-handled shovel .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 20]: I sat down , in the cabin , and gave myself up to solid misery -- so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 36]: Now in pleasanter days I had amused myself with writing letters to the chief paper of the Territory , the Virginia Daily Territorial Enterprise , and had always been surprised when they appeared in print .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 30]: My good opinion of the editors had steadily declined ; for it seemed to me that they might have found something better to fill up with than my literature .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 24]: I had found a letter in the post office as I came home from the hill side , and finally I opened it .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 2]: Eureka !
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 32]: -LSB- I never did know what Eureka meant , but it seems to be as proper a word to heave in as any when no other that sounds pretty offers . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 25]: It was a deliberate offer to me of Twenty-Five Dollars a week to come up to Virginia and be city editor of the Enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 25]: I would have challenged the publisher in the `` blind lead '' days -- I wanted to fall down and worship him , now .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 21]: Twenty-Five Dollars a week -- it looked like bloated luxury -- a fortune a sinful and lavish waste of money .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 35]: But my transports cooled when I thought of my inexperience and consequent unfitness for the position -- and straightway , on top of this , my long array of failures rose up before me .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 38]: Yet if I refused this place I must presently become dependent upon somebody for my bread , a thing necessarily distasteful to a man who had never experienced such a humiliation since he was thirteen years old .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 25]: Not much to be proud of , since it is so common -- but then it was all I had to be proud of .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 10]: So I was scared into being a city editor .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 7]: I would have declined , otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 10]: Necessity is the mother of `` taking chances . ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 52]: I do not doubt that if , at that time , I had been offered a salary to translate the Talmud from the original Hebrew , I would have accepted -- albeit with diffidence and some misgivings -- and thrown as much variety into it as I could for the money .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 12]: I went up to Virginia and entered upon my new vocation .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 45]: I was a rusty looking city editor , I am free to confess -- coatless , slouch hat , blue woolen shirt , pantaloons stuffed into boot-tops , whiskered half down to the waist , and the universal navy revolver slung to my belt .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 12]: But I secured a more Christian costume and discarded the revolver .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 51]: I had never had occasion to kill anybody , nor ever felt a desire to do so , but had worn the thing in deference to popular sentiment , and in order that I might not , by its absence , be offensively conspicuous , and a subject of remark .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 13]: But the other editors , and all the printers , carried revolvers .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 71]: I asked the chief editor and proprietor -LRB- Mr. Goodman , I will call him , since it describes him as well as any name could do -RRB- for some instructions with regard to my duties , and he told me to go all over town and ask all sorts of people all sorts of questions , make notes of the information gained , and write them out for publication .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 56]: And he added : `` Never say ` We learn ' so-and-so , or ` It is reported , ' or ` It is rumored , ' or ` We understand ' so-and-so , but go to headquarters and get the absolute facts , and then speak out and say ` It is so-and-so . '
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 11]: Otherwise , people will not put confidence in your news .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 17]: Unassailable certainly is the thing that gives a newspaper the firmest and most valuable reputation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 49]: It was the whole thing in a nut-shell ; and to this day when I find a reporter commencing his article with `` We understand , '' I gather a suspicion that he has not taken as much pains to inform himself as he ought to have done .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 37]: I moralize well , but I did not always practise well when I was a city editor ; I let fancy get the upper hand of fact too often when there was a dearth of news .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 13]: I can never forget my first day 's experience as a reporter .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 18]: I wandered about town questioning everybody , boring everybody , and finding out that nobody knew anything .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 12]: At the end of five hours my notebook was still barren .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 6]: I spoke to Mr. Goodman .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 28]: He said : `` Dan used to make a good thing out of the hay wagons in a dry time when there were no fires or inquests .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 10]: Are there no hay wagons in from the Truckee ?
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 26]: If there are , you might speak of the renewed activity and all that sort of thing , in the hay business , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 18]: `` It is n't sensational or exciting , but it fills up and looks business like . ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 18]: I canvassed the city again and found one wretched old hay truck dragging in from the country .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 8]: But I made affluent use of it .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 42]: I multiplied it by sixteen , brought it into town from sixteen different directions , made sixteen separate items out of it , and got up such another sweat about hay as Virginia City had never seen in the world before .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 4]: This was encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 14]: Two nonpareil columns had to be filled , and I was getting along .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 24]: Presently , when things began to look dismal again , a desperado killed a man in a saloon and joy returned once more .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 14]: I never was so glad over any mere trifle before in my life .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 31]: I said to the murderer : `` Sir , you are a stranger to me , but you have done me a kindness this day which I can never forget .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 18]: If whole years of gratitude can be to you any slight compensation , they shall be yours .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 21]: I was in trouble and you have relieved me nobly and at a time when all seemed dark and drear .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 21]: Count me your friend from this time forth , for I am not a man to forget a favor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 22]: If I did not really say that to him I at least felt a sort of itching desire to do it .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 44]: I wrote up the murder with a hungry attention to details , and when it was finished experienced but one regret -- namely , that they had not hanged my benefactor on the spot , so that I could work him up too .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 30]: Next I discovered some emigrant wagons going into camp on the plaza and found that they had lately come through the hostile Indian country and had fared rather roughly .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 46]: I made the best of the item that the circumstances permitted , and felt that if I were not confined within rigid limits by the presence of the reporters of the other papers I could add particulars that would make the article much more interesting .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 22]: However , I found one wagon that was going on to California , and made some judicious inquiries of the proprietor .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 59]: When I learned , through his short and surly answers to my cross-questioning , that he was certainly going on and would not be in the city next day to make trouble , I got ahead of the other papers , for I took down his list of names and added his party to the killed and wounded .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 23]: Having more scope here , I put this wagon through an Indian fight that to this day has no parallel in history .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 6]: My two columns were filled .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 20]: When I read them over in the morning I felt that I had found my legitimate occupation at last .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 34]: I reasoned within myself that news , and stirring news , too , was what a paper needed , and I felt that I was peculiarly endowed with the ability to furnish it .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 13]: Mr. Goodman said that I was as good a reporter as Dan .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 6]: I desired no higher commendation .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 33]: With encouragement like that , I felt that I could take my pen and murder all the immigrants on the plains if need be and the interests of the paper demanded it .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIII .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 48]: However , as I grew better acquainted with the business and learned the run of the sources of information I ceased to require the aid of fancy to any large extent , and became able to fill my columns without diverging noticeably from the domain of fact .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 26]: I struck up friendships with the reporters of the other journals , and we swapped `` regulars '' with each other and thus economized work .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 26]: `` Regulars '' are permanent sources of news , like courts , bullion returns , `` clean-ups '' at the quartz mills , and inquests .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 28]: Inasmuch as everybody went armed , we had an inquest about every day , and so this department was naturally set down among the `` regulars . ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 8]: We had lively papers in those days .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 12]: My great competitor among the reporters was Boggs of the Union .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 6]: He was an excellent reporter .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 36]: Once in three or four months he would get a little intoxicated , but as a general thing he was a wary and cautious drinker although always ready to tamper a little with the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 30]: He had the advantage of me in one thing ; he could get the monthly public school report and I could not , because the principal hated the Enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 22]: One snowy night when the report was due , I started out sadly wondering how I was going to get it .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 22]: Presently , a few steps up the almost deserted street I stumbled on Boggs and asked him where he was going .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 7]: `` After the school report . ''
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 9]: `` I 'll go along with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 6]: I 'll excuse you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 7]: `` Just as you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 21]: A saloon-keeper 's boy passed by with a steaming pitcher of hot punch , and Boggs snuffed the fragrance gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 15]: He gazed fondly after the boy and saw him start up the Enterprise stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 61]: I said : `` I wish you could help me get that school business , but since you ca n't , I must run up to the Union office and see if I can get them to let me have a proof of it after they have set it up , though I do n't begin to suppose they will .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 4]: Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 6]: `` Hold on a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 36]: I do n't mind getting the report and sitting around with the boys a little , while you copy it , if you 're willing to drop down to the principal 's with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 9]: `` Now you talk like a rational being .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 4]: Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 19]: We plowed a couple of blocks through the snow , got the report and returned to our office .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 9]: It was a short document and soon copied .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 8]: Meantime Boggs helped himself to the punch .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 24]: I gave the manuscript back to him and we started out to get an inquest , for we heard pistol shots near by .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 34]: We got the particulars with little loss of time , for it was only an inferior sort of bar-room murder , and of little interest to the public , and then we separated .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 68]: Away at three o'clock in the morning , when we had gone to press and were having a relaxing concert as usual -- for some of the printers were good singers and others good performers on the guitar and on that atrocity the accordion -- the proprietor of the Union strode in and desired to know if anybody had heard anything of Boggs or the school report .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 16]: We stated the case , and all turned out to help hunt for the delinquent .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 60]: We found him standing on a table in a saloon , with an old tin lantern in one hand and the school report in the other , haranguing a gang of intoxicated Cornish miners on the iniquity of squandering the public moneys on education `` when hundreds and hundreds of honest hard-working men are literally starving for whiskey . ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 5]: -LSB- Riotous applause . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 14]: He had been assisting in a regal spree with those parties for hours .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 10]: We dragged him away and put him to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 46]: Of course there was no school report in the Union , and Boggs held me accountable , though I was innocent of any intention or desire to compass its absence from that paper and was as sorry as any one that the misfortune had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 6]: But we were perfectly friendly .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 62]: The day that the school report was next due , the proprietor of the `` Genessee '' mine furnished us a buggy and asked us to go down and write something about the property -- a very common request and one always gladly acceded to when people furnished buggies , for we were as fond of pleasure excursions as other people .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 44]: In due time we arrived at the `` mine '' -- nothing but a hole in the ground ninety feet deep , and no way of getting down into it but by holding on to a rope and being lowered with a windlass .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 10]: The workmen had just gone off somewhere to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 59]: I was not strong enough to lower Boggs 's bulk ; so I took an unlighted candle in my teeth , made a loop for my foot in the end of the rope , implored Boggs not to go to sleep or let the windlass get the start of him , and then swung out over the shaft .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 14]: I reached the bottom muddy and bruised about the elbows , but safe .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 23]: I lit the candle , made an examination of the rock , selected some specimens and shouted to Boggs to hoist away .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 25]: Presently a head appeared in the circle of daylight away aloft , and a voice came down : `` Are you all set ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 8]: `` All set -- hoist away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 6]: `` Are you comfortable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 4]: `` Perfectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 8]: `` Could you wait a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 9]: `` Oh certainly -- no particular hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 7]: `` Well -- good by . ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 6]: Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 7]: `` After the school report ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 4]: And he did .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 29]: I staid down there an hour , and surprised the workmen when they hauled up and found a man on the rope instead of a bucket of rock .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 12]: I walked home , too -- five miles -- up hill .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 13]: We had no school report next morning ; but the Union had .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 27]: Six months after my entry into journalism the grand `` flush times '' of Silverland began , and they continued with unabated splendor for three years .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 40]: All difficulty about filling up the `` local department '' ceased , and the only trouble now was how to make the lengthened columns hold the world of incidents and happenings that came to our literary net every day .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 23]: Virginia had grown to be the `` livest '' town , for its age and population , that America had ever produced .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 26]: The sidewalks swarmed with people -- to such an extent , indeed , that it was generally no easy matter to stem the human tide .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 17]: The streets themselves were just as crowded with quartz wagons , freight teams and other vehicles .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 5]: The procession was endless .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 24]: So great was the pack , that buggies frequently had to wait half an hour for an opportunity to cross the principal street .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 43]: Joy sat on every countenance , and there was a glad , almost fierce , intensity in every eye , that told of the money-getting schemes that were seething in every brain and the high hope that held sway in every heart .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 23]: Money was as plenty as dust ; every individual considered himself wealthy , and a melancholy countenance was nowhere to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 120]: There were military companies , fire companies , brass bands , banks , hotels , theatres , `` hurdy-gurdy houses , '' wide-open gambling palaces , political pow-wows , civic processions , street fights , murders , inquests , riots , a whiskey mill every fifteen steps , a Board of Aldermen , a Mayor , a City Surveyor , a City Engineer , a Chief of the Fire Department , with First , Second and Third Assistants , a Chief of Police , City Marshal and a large police force , two Boards of Mining Brokers , a dozen breweries and half a dozen jails and station-houses in full operation , and some talk of building a church .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 10]: The `` flush times '' were in magnificent flower !
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 23]: Large fire-proof brick buildings were going up in the principal streets , and the wooden suburbs were spreading out in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 10]: Town lots soared up to prices that were amazing .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 31]: The great `` Comstock lode '' stretched its opulent length straight through the town from north to south , and every mine on it was in diligent process of development .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 38]: One of these mines alone employed six hundred and seventy-five men , and in the matter of elections the adage was , `` as the ` Gould and Curry ' goes , so goes the city . ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 39]: Laboring men 's wages were four and six dollars a day , and they worked in three `` shifts '' or gangs , and the blasting and picking and shoveling went on without ceasing , night and day .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 44]: The `` city '' of Virginia roosted royally midway up the steep side of Mount Davidson , seven thousand two hundred feet above the level of the sea , and in the clear Nevada atmosphere was visible from a distance of fifty miles !
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 54]: It claimed a population of fifteen thousand to eighteen thousand , and all day long half of this little army swarmed the streets like bees and the other half swarmed among the drifts and tunnels of the `` Comstock , '' hundreds of feet down in the earth directly under those same streets .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 26]: Often we felt our chairs jar , and heard the faint boom of a blast down in the bowels of the earth under the office .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 19]: The mountain side was so steep that the entire town had a slant to it like a roof .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 22]: Each street was a terrace , and from each to the next street below the descent was forty or fifty feet .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 55]: The fronts of the houses were level with the street they faced , but their rear first floors were propped on lofty stilts ; a man could stand at a rear first floor window of a C street house and look down the chimneys of the row of houses below him facing D street .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 50]: It was a laborious climb , in that thin atmosphere , to ascend from D to A street , and you were panting and out of breath when you got there ; but you could turn around and go down again like a house a-fire -- so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 47]: The atmosphere was so rarified , on account of the great altitude , that one 's blood lay near the surface always , and the scratch of a pin was a disaster worth worrying about , for the chances were that a grievous erysipelas would ensue .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 64]: But to offset this , the thin atmosphere seemed to carry healing to gunshot wounds , and therefore , to simply shoot your adversary through both lungs was a thing not likely to afford you any permanent satisfaction , for he would be nearly certain to be around looking for you within the month , and not with an opera glass , either .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 60]: From Virginia 's airy situation one could look over a vast , far-reaching panorama of mountain ranges and deserts ; and whether the day was bright or overcast , whether the sun was rising or setting , or flaming in the zenith , or whether night and the moon held sway , the spectacle was always impressive and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 104]: Over your head Mount Davidson lifted its gray dome , and before and below you a rugged canyon clove the battlemented hills , making a sombre gateway through which a soft-tinted desert was glimpsed , with the silver thread of a river winding through it , bordered with trees which many miles of distance diminished to a delicate fringe ; and still further away the snowy mountains rose up and stretched their long barrier to the filmy horizon -- far enough beyond a lake that burned in the desert like a fallen sun , though that , itself , lay fifty miles removed .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 15]: Look from your window where you would , there was fascination in the picture .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 51]: At rare intervals -- but very rare -- there were clouds in our skies , and then the setting sun would gild and flush and glorify this mighty expanse of scenery with a bewildering pomp of color that held the eye like a spell and moved the spirit like music .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIV .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 10]: My salary was increased to forty dollars a week .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 6]: But I seldom drew it .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 35]: I had plenty of other resources , and what were two broad twenty-dollar gold pieces to a man who had his pockets full of such and a cumbersome abundance of bright half dollars besides ?
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 14]: -LSB- Paper money has never come into use on the Pacific coast . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 21]: Reporting was lucrative , and every man in the town was lavish with his money and his `` feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 14]: The city and all the great mountain side were riddled with mining shafts .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 7]: There were more mines than miners .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 41]: True , not ten of these mines were yielding rock worth hauling to a mill , but everybody said , `` Wait till the shaft gets down where the ledge comes in solid , and then you will see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 5]: So nobody was discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 20]: These were nearly all `` wild cat '' mines , and wholly worthless , but nobody believed it then .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 84]: The `` Ophir , '' the `` Gould & Curry , '' the `` Mexican , '' and other great mines on the Comstock lead in Virginia and Gold Hill were turning out huge piles of rich rock every day , and every man believed that his little wild cat claim was as good as any on the `` main lead '' and would infallibly be worth a thousand dollars a foot when he `` got down where it came in solid . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 18]: Poor fellow , he was blessedly blind to the fact that he never would see that day .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 28]: So the thousand wild cat shafts burrowed deeper and deeper into the earth day by day , and all men were beside themselves with hope and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 8]: How they labored , prophesied , exulted !
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 13]: Surely nothing like it was ever seen before since the world began .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 37]: Every one of these wild cat mines -- not mines , but holes in the ground over imaginary mines -- was incorporated and had handsomely engraved `` stock '' and the stock was salable , too .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 15]: It was bought and sold with a feverish avidity in the boards every day .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 79]: You could go up on the mountain side , scratch around and find a ledge -LRB- there was no lack of them -RRB- , put up a `` notice '' with a grandiloquent name in it , start a shaft , get your stock printed , and with nothing whatever to prove that your mine was worth a straw , you could put your stock on the market and sell out for hundreds and even thousands of dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 20]: To make money , and make it fast , was as easy as it was to eat your dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 18]: Every man owned `` feet '' in fifty different wild cat mines and considered his fortune made .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 13]: Think of a city with not one solitary poor man in it !
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 82]: One would suppose that when month after month went by and still not a wild cat mine -LRB- by wild cat I mean , in general terms , any claim not located on the mother vein , i.e. , the `` Comstock '' -RRB- yielded a ton of rock worth crushing , the people would begin to wonder if they were not putting too much faith in their prospective riches ; but there was not a thought of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 12]: They burrowed away , bought and sold , and were happy .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 47]: New claims were taken up daily , and it was the friendly custom to run straight to the newspaper offices , give the reporter forty or fifty `` feet , '' and get them to go and examine the mine and publish a notice of it .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 17]: They did not care a fig what you said about the property so you said something .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 62]: Consequently we generally said a word or two to the effect that the `` indications '' were good , or that the ledge was `` six feet wide , '' or that the rock `` resembled the Comstock '' -LRB- and so it did -- but as a general thing the resemblance was not startling enough to knock you down -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 34]: If the rock was moderately promising , we followed the custom of the country , used strong adjectives and frothed at the mouth as if a very marvel in silver discoveries had transpired .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 67]: If the mine was a `` developed '' one , and had no pay ore to show -LRB- and of course it had n't -RRB- , we praised the tunnel ; said it was one of the most infatuating tunnels in the land ; driveled and driveled about the tunnel till we ran entirely out of ecstasies -- but never said a word about the rock .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 58]: We would squander half a column of adulation on a shaft , or a new wire rope , or a dressed pine windlass , or a fascinating force pump , and close with a burst of admiration of the `` gentlemanly and efficient Superintendent '' of the mine -- but never utter a whisper about the rock .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 10]: And those people were always pleased , always satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 52]: Occasionally we patched up and varnished our reputation for discrimination and stern , undeviating accuracy , by giving some old abandoned claim a blast that ought to have made its dry bones rattle -- and then somebody would seize it and sell it on the fleeting notoriety thus conferred upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 15]: There was nothing in the shape of a mining claim that was not salable .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 10]: We received presents of `` feet '' every day .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 34]: If we needed a hundred dollars or so , we sold some ; if not , we hoarded it away , satisfied that it would ultimately be worth a thousand dollars a foot .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 12]: I had a trunk about half full of `` stock . ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 37]: When a claim made a stir in the market and went up to a high figure , I searched through my pile to see if I had any of its stock -- and generally found it .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 44]: The prices rose and fell constantly ; but still a fall disturbed us little , because a thousand dollars a foot was our figure , and so we were content to let it fluctuate as much as it pleased till it reached it .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 20]: My pile of stock was not all given to me by people who wished their claims `` noticed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 45]: At least half of it was given me by persons who had no thought of such a thing , and looked for nothing more than a simple verbal `` thank you ; '' and you were not even obliged by law to furnish that .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 33]: If you are coming up the street with a couple of baskets of apples in your hands , and you meet a friend , you naturally invite him to take a few .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 15]: That describes the condition of things in Virginia in the `` flush times . ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 31]: Every man had his pockets full of stock , and it was the actual custom of the country to part with small quantities of it to friends without the asking .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 56]: Very often it was a good idea to close the transaction instantly , when a man offered a stock present to a friend , for the offer was only good and binding at that moment , and if the price went to a high figure shortly afterward the procrastination was a thing to be regretted .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 34]: Mr. Stewart -LRB- Senator , now , from Nevada -RRB- one day told me he would give me twenty feet of `` Justis '' stock if I would walk over to his office .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 10]: It was worth five or ten dollars a foot .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 20]: I asked him to make the offer good for next day , as I was just going to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 22]: He said he would not be in town ; so I risked it and took my dinner instead of the stock .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 26]: Within the week the price went up to seventy dollars and afterward to a hundred and fifty , but nothing could make that man yield .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 18]: I suppose he sold that stock of mine and placed the guilty proceeds in his own pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 12]: -LSB- My revenge will be found in the accompanying portrait . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 25]: I met three friends one afternoon , who said they had been buying `` Overman '' stock at auction at eight dollars a foot .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 33]: One said if I would come up to his office he would give me fifteen feet ; another said he would add fifteen ; the third said he would do the same .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 12]: But I was going after an inquest and could not stop .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 49]: A few weeks afterward they sold all their `` Overman '' at six hundred dollars a foot and generously came around to tell me about it -- and also to urge me to accept of the next forty-five feet of it that people tried to force on me .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 23]: These are actual facts , and I could make the list a long one and still confine myself strictly to the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 39]: Many a time friends gave us as much as twenty-five feet of stock that was selling at twenty-five dollars a foot , and they thought no more of it than they would of offering a guest a cigar .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 8]: These were `` flush times '' indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 19]: I thought they were going to last always , but somehow I never was much of a prophet .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 73]: To show what a wild spirit possessed the mining brain of the community , I will remark that `` claims '' were actually `` located '' in excavations for cellars , where the pick had exposed what seemed to be quartz veins -- and not cellars in the suburbs , either , but in the very heart of the city ; and forthwith stock would be issued and thrown on the market .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 62]: It was small matter who the cellar belonged to -- the `` ledge '' belonged to the finder , and unless the United States government interfered -LRB- inasmuch as the government holds the primary right to mines of the noble metals in Nevada -- or at least did then -RRB- , it was considered to be his privilege to work it .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 32]: Imagine a stranger staking out a mining claim among the costly shrubbery in your front yard and calmly proceeding to lay waste the ground with pick and shovel and blasting powder !
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 8]: It has been often done in California .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 28]: In the middle of one of the principal business streets of Virginia , a man `` located '' a mining claim and began a shaft on it .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 34]: He gave me a hundred feet of the stock and I sold it for a fine suit of clothes because I was afraid somebody would fall down the shaft and sue for damages .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 73]: I owned in another claim that was located in the middle of another street ; and to show how absurd people can be , that `` East India '' stock -LRB- as it was called -RRB- sold briskly although there was an ancient tunnel running directly under the claim and any man could go into it and see that it did not cut a quartz ledge or anything that remotely resembled one .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 24]: One plan of acquiring sudden wealth was to `` salt '' a wild cat claim and sell out while the excitement was up .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 5]: The process was simple .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 43]: The schemer located a worthless ledge , sunk a shaft on it , bought a wagon load of rich `` Comstock '' ore , dumped a portion of it into the shaft and piled the rest by its side , above ground .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 18]: Then he showed the property to a simpleton and sold it to him at a high figure .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 20]: Of course the wagon load of rich ore was all that the victim ever got out of his purchase .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 17]: A most remarkable case of `` salting '' was that of the `` North Ophir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 28]: It was claimed that this vein was a `` remote extension '' of the original `` Ophir , '' a valuable mine on the `` Comstock . ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 16]: For a few days everybody was talking about the rich developments in the North Ophir .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 15]: It was said that it yielded perfectly pure silver in small , solid lumps .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 37]: I went to the place with the owners , and found a shaft six or eight feet deep , in the bottom of which was a badly shattered vein of dull , yellowish , unpromising rock .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 12]: One would as soon expect to find silver in a grindstone .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 38]: We got out a pan of the rubbish and washed it in a puddle , and sure enough , among the sediment we found half a dozen black , bullet-looking pellets of unimpeachable `` native '' silver .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 20]: Nobody had ever heard of such a thing before ; science could not account for such a queer novelty .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 39]: The stock rose to sixty-five dollars a foot , and at this figure the world-renowned tragedian , McKean Buchanan , bought a commanding interest and prepared to quit the stage once more -- he was always doing that .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 36]: And then it transpired that the mine had been `` salted '' -- and not in any hackneyed way , either , but in a singularly bold , barefaced and peculiarly original and outrageous fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 40]: On one of the lumps of `` native '' silver was discovered the minted legend , `` TED STATES OF , '' and then it was plainly apparent that the mine had been `` salted '' with melted half-dollars !
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 28]: The lumps thus obtained had been blackened till they resembled native silver , and were then mixed with the shattered rock in the bottom of the shaft .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 5]: It is literally true .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 19]: Of course the price of the stock at once fell to nothing , and the tragedian was ruined .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 14]: But for this calamity we might have lost McKean Buchanan from the stage .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLV .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 9]: The `` flush times '' held bravely on .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 34]: Something over two years before , Mr. Goodman and another journeyman printer , had borrowed forty dollars and set out from San Francisco to try their fortunes in the new city of Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 19]: They found the Territorial Enterprise , a poverty-stricken weekly journal , gasping for breath and likely to die .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 21]: They bought it , type , fixtures , good-will and all , for a thousand dollars , on long time .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 32]: The editorial sanctum , news-room , press-room , publication office , bed-chamber , parlor , and kitchen were all compressed into one apartment and it was a small one , too .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 26]: The editors and printers slept on the floor , a Chinaman did their cooking , and the `` imposing-stone '' was the general dinner table .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 6]: But now things were changed .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 39]: The paper was a great daily , printed by steam ; there were five editors and twenty-three compositors ; the subscription price was sixteen dollars a year ; the advertising rates were exorbitant , and the columns crowded .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 31]: The paper was clearing from six to ten thousand dollars a month , and the `` Enterprise Building '' was finished and ready for occupation -- a stately fireproof brick .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 29]: Every day from five all the way up to eleven columns of `` live '' advertisements were left out or crowded into spasmodic and irregular `` supplements . ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 26]: The `` Gould & Curry '' company were erecting a monster hundred-stamp mill at a cost that ultimately fell little short of a million dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 35]: Gould & Curry stock paid heavy dividends -- a rare thing , and an experience confined to the dozen or fifteen claims located on the `` main lead , '' the `` Comstock . ''
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 23]: The Superintendent of the Gould & Curry lived , rent free , in a fine house built and furnished by the company .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 25]: He drove a fine pair of horses which were a present from the company , and his salary was twelve thousand dollars a year .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 42]: The superintendent of another of the great mines traveled in grand state , had a salary of twenty-eight thousand dollars a year , and in a law suit in after days claimed that he was to have had one per cent .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 9]: on the gross yield of the bullion likewise .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 5]: Money was wonderfully plenty .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 30]: The trouble was , not how to get it , -- but how to spend it , how to lavish it , get rid of it , squander it .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 50]: And so it was a happy thing that just at this juncture the news came over the wires that a great United States Sanitary Commission had been formed and money was wanted for the relief of the wounded sailors and soldiers of the Union languishing in the Eastern hospitals .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 23]: Right on the heels of it came word that San Francisco had responded superbly before the telegram was half a day old .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 6]: Virginia rose as one man !
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 73]: A Sanitary Committee was hurriedly organized , and its chairman mounted a vacant cart in C street and tried to make the clamorous multitude understand that the rest of the committee were flying hither and thither and working with all their might and main , and that if the town would only wait an hour , an office would be ready , books opened , and the Commission prepared to receive contributions .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 31]: His voice was drowned and his information lost in a ceaseless roar of cheers , and demands that the money be received now -- they swore they would not wait .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 35]: The chairman pleaded and argued , but , deaf to all entreaty , men plowed their way through the throng and rained checks of gold coin into the cart and skurried away for more .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 28]: Hands clutching money , were thrust aloft out of the jam by men who hoped this eloquent appeal would cleave a road their strugglings could not open .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 26]: The very Chinamen and Indians caught the excitement and dashed their half dollars into the cart without knowing or caring what it was all about .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 37]: Women plunged into the crowd , trimly attired , fought their way to the cart with their coin , and emerged again , by and by , with their apparel in a state of hopeless dilapidation .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 36]: It was the wildest mob Virginia had ever seen and the most determined and ungovernable ; and when at last it abated its fury and dispersed , it had not a penny in its pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 19]: To use its own phraseology , it came there `` flush '' and went away `` busted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 26]: After that , the Commission got itself into systematic working order , and for weeks the contributions flowed into its treasury in a generous stream .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 44]: Individuals and all sorts of organizations levied upon themselves a regular weekly tax for the sanitary fund , graduated according to their means , and there was not another grand universal outburst till the famous `` Sanitary Flour Sack '' came our way .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 7]: Its history is peculiar and interesting .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 40]: A former schoolmate of mine , by the name of Reuel Gridley , was living at the little city of Austin , in the Reese river country , at this time , and was the Democratic candidate for mayor .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 36]: He and the Republican candidate made an agreement that the defeated man should be publicly presented with a fifty-pound sack of flour by the successful one , and should carry it home on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 4]: Gridley was defeated .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 43]: The new mayor gave him the sack of flour , and he shouldered it and carried it a mile or two , from Lower Austin to his home in Upper Austin , attended by a band of music and the whole population .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 25]: Arrived there , he said he did not need the flour , and asked what the people thought he had better do with it .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 21]: A voice said : `` Sell it to the highest bidder , for the benefit of the Sanitary fund . ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 23]: The suggestion was greeted with a round of applause , and Gridley mounted a dry-goods box and assumed the role of auctioneer .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 41]: The bids went higher and higher , as the sympathies of the pioneers awoke and expanded , till at last the sack was knocked down to a mill man at two hundred and fifty dollars , and his check taken .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 23]: He was asked where he would have the flour delivered , and he said : `` Nowhere -- sell it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 19]: Now the cheers went up royally , and the multitude were fairly in the spirit of the thing .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 40]: So Gridley stood there and shouted and perspired till the sun went down ; and when the crowd dispersed he had sold the sack to three hundred different people , and had taken in eight thousand dollars in gold .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 10]: And still the flour sack was in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 20]: The news came to Virginia , and a telegram went back : `` Fetch along your flour sack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 23]: Thirty-six hours afterward Gridley arrived , and an afternoon mass meeting was held in the Opera House , and the auction began .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 23]: But the sack had come sooner than it was expected ; the people were not thoroughly aroused , and the sale dragged .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 20]: At nightfall only five thousand dollars had been secured , and there was a crestfallen feeling in the community .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 24]: However , there was no disposition to let the matter rest here and acknowledge vanquishment at the hands of the village of Austin .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 31]: Till late in the night the principal citizens were at work arranging the morrow 's campaign , and when they went to bed they had no fears for the result .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 44]: At eleven the next morning a procession of open carriages , attended by clamorous bands of music and adorned with a moving display of flags , filed along C street and was soon in danger of blockade by a huzzaing multitude of citizens .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 37]: In the first carriage sat Gridley , with the flour sack in prominent view , the latter splendid with bright paint and gilt lettering ; also in the same carriage sat the mayor and the recorder .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 20]: The other carriages contained the Common Council , the editors and reporters , and other people of imposing consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 62]: The crowd pressed to the corner of C and Taylor streets , expecting the sale to begin there , but they were disappointed , and also unspeakably surprised ; for the cavalcade moved on as if Virginia had ceased to be of importance , and took its way over the `` divide , '' toward the small town of Gold Hill .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 26]: Telegrams had gone ahead to Gold Hill , Silver City and Dayton , and those communities were at fever heat and rife for the conflict .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 11]: It was a very hot day , and wonderfully dusty .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 28]: At the end of a short half hour we descended into Gold Hill with drums beating and colors flying , and enveloped in imposing clouds of dust .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 43]: The whole population -- men , women and children , Chinamen and Indians , were massed in the main street , all the flags in town were at the mast head , and the blare of the bands was drowned in cheers .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 18]: Gridley stood up and asked who would make the first bid for the National Sanitary Flour Sack .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 19]: Gen. W. said : `` The Yellow Jacket silver mining company offers a thousand dollars , coin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 6]: A tempest of applause followed .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 44]: A telegram carried the news to Virginia , and fifteen minutes afterward that city 's population was massed in the streets devouring the tidings -- for it was part of the programme that the bulletin boards should do a good work that day .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 18]: Every few minutes a new dispatch was bulletined from Gold Hill , and still the excitement grew .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 27]: Telegrams began to return to us from Virginia beseeching Gridley to bring back the flour sack ; but such was not the plan of the campaign .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 37]: At the end of an hour Gold Hill 's small population had paid a figure for the flour sack that awoke all the enthusiasm of Virginia when the grand total was displayed upon the bulletin boards .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 58]: Then the Gridley cavalcade moved on , a giant refreshed with new lager beer and plenty of it -- for the people brought it to the carriages without waiting to measure it -- and within three hours more the expedition had carried Silver City and Dayton by storm and was on its way back covered with glory .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 60]: Every move had been telegraphed and bulletined , and as the procession entered Virginia and filed down C street at half past eight in the evening the town was abroad in the thoroughfares , torches were glaring , flags flying , bands playing , cheer on cheer cleaving the air , and the city ready to surrender at discretion .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 49]: The auction began , every bid was greeted with bursts of applause , and at the end of two hours and a half a population of fifteen thousand souls had paid in coin for a fifty-pound sack of flour a sum equal to forty thousand dollars in greenbacks !
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 22]: It was at a rate in the neighborhood of three dollars for each man , woman and child of the population .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 40]: The grand total would have been twice as large , but the streets were very narrow , and hundreds who wanted to bid could not get within a block of the stand , and could not make themselves heard .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 18]: These grew tired of waiting and many of them went home long before the auction was over .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 11]: This was the greatest day Virginia ever saw , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 17]: Gridley sold the sack in Carson city and several California towns ; also in San Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 18]: Then he took it east and sold it in one or two Atlantic cities , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 71]: I am not sure of that , but I know that he finally carried it to St. Louis , where a monster Sanitary Fair was being held , and after selling it there for a large sum and helping on the enthusiasm by displaying the portly silver bricks which Nevada 's donation had produced , he had the flour baked up into small cakes and retailed them at high prices .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 30]: It was estimated that when the flour sack 's mission was ended it had been sold for a grand total of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in greenbacks !
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 23]: This is probably the only instance on record where common family flour brought three thousand dollars a pound in the public market .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 43]: It is due to Mr. Gridley 's memory to mention that the expenses of his sanitary flour sack expedition of fifteen thousand miles , going and returning , were paid in large part if not entirely , out of his own pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 13]: The time he gave to it was not less than three months .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 14]: Mr. Gridley was a soldier in the Mexican war and a pioneer Californian .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 15]: He died at Stockton , California , in December , 1870 , greatly regretted .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVI .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 17]: There were nabobs in those days -- in the `` flush times , '' I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 11]: Every rich strike in the mines created one or two .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 8]: I call to mind several of these .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 36]: They were careless , easy-going fellows , as a general thing , and the community at large was as much benefited by their riches as they were themselves -- possibly more , in some cases .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 30]: Two cousins , teamsters , did some hauling for a man and had to take a small segregated portion of a silver mine in lieu of $ 300 cash .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 17]: They gave an outsider a third to open the mine , and they went on teaming .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 4]: But not long .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 27]: Ten months afterward the mine was out of debt and paying each owner $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 a month -- say $ 100,000 a year .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 39]: One of the earliest nabobs that Nevada was delivered of wore $ 6,000 worth of diamonds in his bosom , and swore he was unhappy because he could not spend his money as fast as he made it .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 47]: Another Nevada nabob boasted an income that often reached $ 16,000 a month ; and he used to love to tell how he had worked in the very mine that yielded it , for five dollars a day , when he first came to the country .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 67]: The silver and sage-brush State has knowledge of another of these pets of fortune -- lifted from actual poverty to affluence almost in a single night -- who was able to offer $ 100,000 for a position of high official distinction , shortly afterward , and did offer it -- but failed to get it , his politics not being as sound as his bank account .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 6]: Then there was John Smith .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 24]: He was a good , honest , kind-hearted soul , born and reared in the lower ranks of life , and miraculously ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 49]: He drove a team , and owned a small ranch -- a ranch that paid him a comfortable living , for although it yielded but little hay , what little it did yield was worth from $ 250 to $ 300 in gold per ton in the market .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 19]: Presently Smith traded a few acres of the ranch for a small undeveloped silver mine in Gold Hill .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 12]: He opened the mine and built a little unpretending ten-stamp mill .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 21]: Eighteen months afterward he retired from the hay business , for his mining income had reached a most comfortable figure .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 18]: Some people said it was $ 30,000 a month , and others said it was $ 60,000 .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 8]: Smith was very rich at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 9]: And then he went to Europe and traveled .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 44]: And when he came back he was never tired of telling about the fine hogs he had seen in England , and the gorgeous sheep he had seen in Spain , and the fine cattle he had noticed in the vicinity of Rome .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 16]: He was full of wonders of the old world , and advised everybody to travel .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 19]: He said a man never imagined what surprising things there were in the world till he had traveled .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 43]: One day , on board ship , the passengers made up a pool of $ 500 , which was to be the property of the man who should come nearest to guessing the run of the vessel for the next twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 19]: Next day , toward noon , the figures were all in the purser 's hands in sealed envelopes .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 14]: Smith was serene and happy , for he had been bribing the engineer .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 7]: But another party won the prize !
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 11]: Smith said : `` Here , that wo n't do !
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 13]: He guessed two miles wider of the mark than I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 18]: The purser said , `` Mr. Smith , you missed it further than any man on board .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 10]: We traveled two hundred and eight miles yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 27]: `` Well , sir , '' said Smith , `` that 's just where I 've got you , for I guessed two hundred and nine .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 27]: If you 'll look at my figgers again you 'll find a 2 and two 0 's , which stands for 200 , do n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 21]: -- and after 'em you 'll find a 9 -LRB- 2009 -RRB- , which stands for two hundred and nine .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 13]: I reckon I 'll take that money , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 24]: The Gould & Curry claim comprised twelve hundred feet , and it all belonged originally to the two men whose names it bears .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 45]: Mr. Curry owned two thirds of it -- and he said that he sold it out for twenty-five hundred dollars in cash , and an old plug horse that ate up his market value in hay and barley in seventeen days by the watch .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 41]: And he said that Gould sold out for a pair of second-hand government blankets and a bottle of whisky that killed nine men in three hours , and that an unoffending stranger that smelt the cork was disabled for life .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 25]: Four years afterward the mine thus disposed of was worth in the San Francisco market seven millions six hundred thousand dollars in gold coin .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 38]: In the early days a poverty-stricken Mexican who lived in a canyon directly back of Virginia City , had a stream of water as large as a man 's wrist trickling from the hill-side on his premises .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 21]: The Ophir Company segregated a hundred feet of their mine and traded it to him for the stream of water .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 32]: The hundred feet proved to be the richest part of the entire mine ; four years after the swap , its market value -LRB- including its mill -RRB- was $ 1,500,000 .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 36]: An individual who owned twenty feet in the Ophir mine before its great riches were revealed to men , traded it for a horse , and a very sorry looking brute he was , too .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 77]: A year or so afterward , when Ophir stock went up to $ 3,000 a foot , this man , who had not a cent , used to say he was the most startling example of magnificence and misery the world had ever seen -- because he was able to ride a sixty-thousand-dollar horse -- yet could not scrape up cash enough to buy a saddle , and was obliged to borrow one or ride bareback .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 16]: He said if fortune were to give him another sixty-thousand-dollar horse it would ruin him .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 86]: A youth of nineteen , who was a telegraph operator in Virginia on a salary of a hundred dollars a month , and who , when he could not make out German names in the list of San Francisco steamer arrivals , used to ingeniously select and supply substitutes for them out of an old Berlin city directory , made himself rich by watching the mining telegrams that passed through his hands and buying and selling stocks accordingly , through a friend in San Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 71]: Once when a private dispatch was sent from Virginia announcing a rich strike in a prominent mine and advising that the matter be kept secret till a large amount of the stock could be secured , he bought forty `` feet '' of the stock at twenty dollars a foot , and afterward sold half of it at eight hundred dollars a foot and the rest at double that figure .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 16]: Within three months he was worth $ 150,000 , and had resigned his telegraphic position .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 53]: Another telegraph operator who had been discharged by the company for divulging the secrets of the office , agreed with a moneyed man in San Francisco to furnish him the result of a great Virginia mining lawsuit within an hour after its private reception by the parties to it in San Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 23]: For this he was to have a large percentage of the profits on purchases and sales made on it by his fellow-conspirator .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 66]: So he went , disguised as a teamster , to a little wayside telegraph office in the mountains , got acquainted with the operator , and sat in the office day after day , smoking his pipe , complaining that his team was fagged out and unable to travel -- and meantime listening to the dispatches as they passed clicking through the machine from Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 35]: Finally the private dispatch announcing the result of the lawsuit sped over the wires , and as soon as he heard it he telegraphed his friend in San Francisco : `` Am tired waiting .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 9]: Shall sell the team and go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 7]: It was the signal agreed upon .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 20]: The word `` waiting '' left out , would have signified that the suit had gone the other way .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 31]: The mock teamster 's friend picked up a deal of the mining stock , at low figures , before the news became public , and a fortune was the result .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 38]: For a long time after one of the great Virginia mines had been incorporated , about fifty feet of the original location were still in the hands of a man who had never signed the incorporation papers .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 21]: The stock became very valuable , and every effort was made to find this man , but he had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 24]: Once it was heard that he was in New York , and one or two speculators went east but failed to find him .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 30]: Once the news came that he was in the Bermudas , and straightway a speculator or two hurried east and sailed for Bermuda -- but he was not there .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 49]: Finally he was heard of in Mexico , and a friend of his , a bar-keeper on a salary , scraped together a little money and sought him out , bought his `` feet '' for a hundred dollars , returned and sold the property for $ 75,000 .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 5]: But why go on ?
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 26]: The traditions of Silverland are filled with instances like these , and I would never get through enumerating them were I to attempt do it .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 49]: I only desired to give , the reader an idea of a peculiarity of the `` flush times '' which I could not present so strikingly in any other way , and which some mention of was necessary to a realizing comprehension of the time and the country .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 48]: I was personally acquainted with the majority of the nabobs I have referred to , and so , for old acquaintance sake , I have shifted their occupations and experiences around in such a way as to keep the Pacific public from recognizing these once notorious men .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 18]: No longer notorious , for the majority of them have drifted back into poverty and obscurity again .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 26]: In Nevada there used to be current the story of an adventure of two of her nabobs , which may or may not have occurred .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 54]: I give it for what it is worth : Col. Jim had seen somewhat of the world , and knew more or less of its ways ; but Col. Jack was from the back settlements of the States , had led a life of arduous toil , and had never seen a city .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 33]: These two , blessed with sudden wealth , projected a visit to New York , -- Col. Jack to see the sights , and Col. Jim to guard his unsophistication from misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 14]: They reached San Francisco in the night , and sailed in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 39]: Arrived in New York , Col. Jack said : `` I 've heard tell of carriages all my life , and now I mean to have a ride in one ; I do n't care what it costs .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 4]: Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 15]: They stepped out on the sidewalk , and Col. Jim called a stylish barouche .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 10]: But Col. Jack said : `` No , sir !
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 8]: None of your cheap-John turn-outs for me .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 16]: I 'm here to have a good time , and money ai n't any object .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 11]: I mean to have the nobbiest rig that 's going .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 7]: Now here comes the very trick .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 24]: Stop that yaller one with the pictures on it -- do n't you fret -- I 'll stand all the expenses myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 13]: So Col. Jim stopped an empty omnibus , and they got in .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 12]: Said Col. Jack : `` Ai n't it gay , though ?
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 8]: Oh , no , I reckon not !
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 14]: Cushions , and windows , and pictures , till you ca n't rest .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 19]: What would the boys say if they could see us cutting a swell like this in New York ?
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 11]: By George , I wish they could see us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 25]: Then he put his head out of the window , and shouted to the driver : `` Say , Johnny , this suits me !
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 10]: -- suits yours truly , you bet , you !
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 7]: I want this shebang all day .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 8]: I 'm on it , old man !
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 4]: Let 'em out !
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 4]: Make 'em go !
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 12]: We 'll make it all right with you , sonny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 25]: The driver passed his hand through the strap-hole , and tapped for his fare -- it was before the gongs came into common use .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 11]: Col. Jack took the hand , and shook it cordially .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 11]: He said : `` You twig me , old pard !
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 5]: All right between gents .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 12]: Smell of that , and see how you like it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 13]: And he put a twenty-dollar gold piece in the driver 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 12]: After a moment the driver said he could not make change .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 5]: `` Bother the change !
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 4]: Ride it out .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 7]: Put it in your pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 21]: Then to Col. Jim , with a sounding slap on his thigh : `` Ai n't it style , though ?
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 15]: Hanged if I do n't hire this thing every day for a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 11]: The omnibus stopped , and a young lady got in .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 25]: Col. Jack stared a moment , then nudged Col. Jim with his elbow : `` Do n't say a word , '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 10]: `` Let her ride , if she wants to .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 8]: Gracious , there 's room enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 16]: The young lady got out her porte-monnaie , and handed her fare to Col. Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 7]: `` What 's this for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 10]: `` Give it to the driver , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 8]: `` Take back your money , madam .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 6]: We ca n't allow it .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 29]: You 're welcome to ride here as long as you please , but this shebang 's chartered , and we ca n't let you pay a cent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 9]: The girl shrunk into a corner , bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 14]: An old lady with a basket climbed in , and proffered her fare .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 9]: `` Excuse me , '' said Col. Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 18]: `` You 're perfectly welcome here , madam , but we ca n't allow you to pay .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 16]: Set right down there , mum , and do n't you be the least uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 15]: Make yourself just as free as if you was in your own turn-out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 19]: Within two minutes , three gentlemen , two fat women , and a couple of children , entered .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 18]: `` Come right along , friends , '' said Col. Jack ; `` do n't mind us .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 7]: This is a free blow-out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 30]: Then he whispered to Col. Jim , `` New York ai n't no sociable place , I do n't reckon -- it ai n't no name for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 17]: He resisted every effort to pass fares to the driver , and made everybody cordially welcome .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 24]: The situation dawned on the people , and they pocketed their money , and delivered themselves up to covert enjoyment of the episode .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 7]: Half a dozen more passengers entered .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 14]: `` Oh , there 's plenty of room , '' said Col. Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 11]: `` Walk right in , and make yourselves at home .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 17]: A blow-out ai n't worth anything as a blow-out , unless a body has company . ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 17]: Then in a whisper to Col. Jim : `` But ai n't these New Yorkers friendly ?
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 10]: And ai n't they cool about it , too ?
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 5]: Icebergs ai n't anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 16]: I reckon they 'd tackle a hearse , if it was going their way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 12]: More passengers got in ; more yet , and still more .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 21]: Both seats were filled , and a file of men were standing up , holding on to the cleats overhead .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 12]: Parties with baskets and bundles were climbing up on the roof .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 8]: Half-suppressed laughter rippled up from all sides .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 28]: `` Well , for clean , cool , out-and-out cheek , if this do n't bang anything that ever I saw , I 'm an Injun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 4]: whispered Col. Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 7]: A Chinaman crowded his way in .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 5]: `` I weaken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 4]: said Col. Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 6]: `` Hold on , driver !
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 9]: Keep your seats , ladies , and gents .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 10]: Just make yourselves free -- everything 's paid for .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 23]: Driver , rustle these folks around as long as they 're a mind to go -- friends of ours , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 25]: Take them everywheres -- and if you want more money , come to the St. Nicholas , and we 'll make it all right .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 27]: Pleasant journey to you , ladies and gents -- go it just as long as you please -- it sha n't cost you a cent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 23]: The two comrades got out , and Col. Jack said : `` Jimmy , it 's the sociablest place I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 9]: The Chinaman waltzed in as comfortable as anybody .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 14]: If we 'd staid awhile , I reckon we 'd had some niggers .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 27]: B ' George , we 'll have to barricade our doors to-night , or some of these ducks will be trying to sleep with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVII .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 31]: Somebody has said that in order to know a community , one must observe the style of its funerals and know what manner of men they bury with most ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 73]: I can not say which class we buried with most eclat in our `` flush times , '' the distinguished public benefactor or the distinguished rough -- possibly the two chief grades or grand divisions of society honored their illustrious dead about equally ; and hence , no doubt the philosopher I have quoted from would have needed to see two representative funerals in Virginia before forming his estimate of the people .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 12]: There was a grand time over Buck Fanshaw when he died .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 6]: He was a representative citizen .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 29]: He had `` killed his man '' -- not in his own quarrel , it is true , but in defence of a stranger unfairly beset by numbers .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 7]: He had kept a sumptuous saloon .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 21]: He had been the proprietor of a dashing helpmeet whom he could have discarded without the formality of a divorce .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 18]: He had held a high position in the fire department and been a very Warwick in politics .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 20]: When he died there was great lamentation throughout the town , but especially in the vast bottom-stratum of society .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 79]: On the inquest it was shown that Buck Fanshaw , in the delirium of a wasting typhoid fever , had taken arsenic , shot himself through the body , cut his throat , and jumped out of a four-story window and broken his neck -- and after due deliberation , the jury , sad and tearful , but with intelligence unblinded by its sorrow , brought in a verdict of death `` by the visitation of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 8]: What could the world do without juries ?
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 8]: Prodigious preparations were made for the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 43]: All the vehicles in town were hired , all the saloons put in mourning , all the municipal and fire-company flags hung at half-mast , and all the firemen ordered to muster in uniform and bring their machines duly draped in black .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 79]: Now -- let us remark in parenthesis -- as all the peoples of the earth had representative adventurers in the Silverland , and as each adventurer had brought the slang of his nation or his locality with him , the combination made the slang of Nevada the richest and the most infinitely varied and copious that had ever existed anywhere in the world , perhaps , except in the mines of California in the `` early days . ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 7]: Slang was the language of Nevada .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 14]: It was hard to preach a sermon without it , and be understood .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 8]: Such phrases as `` You bet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , I reckon not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 45]: `` No Irish need apply , '' and a hundred others , became so common as to fall from the lips of a speaker unconsciously -- and very often when they did not touch the subject under discussion and consequently failed to mean anything .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 34]: After Buck Fanshaw 's inquest , a meeting of the short-haired brotherhood was held , for nothing can be done on the Pacific coast without a public meeting and an expression of sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 49]: Regretful resolutions were passed and various committees appointed ; among others , a committee of one was deputed to call on the minister , a fragile , gentle , spiritual new fledgling from an Eastern theological seminary , and as yet unacquainted with the ways of the mines .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 28]: The committeeman , `` Scotty '' Briggs , made his visit ; and in after days it was worth something to hear the minister tell about it .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 51]: Scotty was a stalwart rough , whose customary suit , when on weighty official business , like committee work , was a fire helmet , flaming red flannel shirt , patent leather belt with spanner and revolver attached , coat hung over arm , and pants stuffed into boot tops .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 12]: He formed something of a contrast to the pale theological student .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 43]: It is fair to say of Scotty , however , in passing , that he had a warm heart , and a strong love for his friends , and never entered into a quarrel when he could reasonably keep out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 56]: Indeed , it was commonly said that whenever one of Scotty 's fights was investigated , it always turned out that it had originally been no affair of his , but that out of native good-heartedness he had dropped in of his own accord to help the man who was getting the worst of it .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 21]: He and Buck Fanshaw were bosom friends , for years , and had often taken adventurous `` pot-luck '' together .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 57]: On one occasion , they had thrown off their coats and taken the weaker side in a fight among strangers , and after gaining a hard-earned victory , turned and found that the men they were helping had deserted early , and not only that , but had stolen their coats and made off with them !
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 11]: But to return to Scotty 's visit to the minister .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 18]: He was on a sorrowful mission , now , and his face was the picture of woe .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 50]: Being admitted to the presence he sat down before the clergyman , placed his fire-hat on an unfinished manuscript sermon under the minister 's nose , took from it a red silk handkerchief , wiped his brow and heaved a sigh of dismal impressiveness , explanatory of his business .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 35]: He choked , and even shed tears ; but with an effort he mastered his voice and said in lugubrious tones : `` Are you the duck that runs the gospel-mill next door ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 16]: `` Am I the -- pardon me , I believe I do not understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 64]: With another sigh and a half-sob , Scotty rejoined : `` Why you see we are in a bit of trouble , and the boys thought maybe you would give us a lift , if we 'd tackle you -- that is , if I 've got the rights of it and you are the head clerk of the doxology-works next door . ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 17]: `` I am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold is next door . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 5]: `` The which ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 17]: `` The spiritual adviser of the little company of believers whose sanctuary adjoins these premises . ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 22]: Scotty scratched his head , reflected a moment , and then said : `` You ruther hold over me , pard .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 9]: I reckon I ca n't call that hand .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 7]: Ante and pass the buck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 4]: I beg pardon .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 9]: What did I understand you to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 12]: `` Well , you 've ruther got the bulge on me .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 11]: Or maybe we 've both got the bulge , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 12]: You do n't smoke me and I do n't smoke you .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 49]: You see , one of the boys has passed in his checks and we want to give him a good send-off , and so the thing I 'm on now is to roust out somebody to jerk a little chin-music for us and waltz him through handsome . ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 13]: `` My friend , I seem to grow more and more bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 8]: Your observations are wholly incomprehensible to me .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 9]: Can not you simplify them in some way ?
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 14]: At first I thought perhaps I understood you , but I grope now .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 24]: Would it not expedite matters if you restricted yourself to categorical statements of fact unencumbered with obstructing accumulations of metaphor and allegory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 7]: Another pause , and more reflection .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 16]: Then , said Scotty : `` I 'll have to pass , I judge . ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 10]: `` You 've raised me out , pard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 10]: `` I still fail to catch your meaning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 19]: `` Why , that last lead of yourn is too many for me -- that 's the idea .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 9]: I ca n't neither-trump nor follow suit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 9]: The clergyman sank back in his chair perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 14]: Scotty leaned his head on his hand and gave himself up to thought .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 10]: Presently his face came up , sorrowful but confident .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 17]: `` I 've got it now , so 's you can savvy , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 8]: `` What we want is a gospel-sharp .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 3]: See ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 5]: `` A what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 3]: `` Gospel-sharp .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 3]: Parson . ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 8]: Why did you not say so before ?
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 9]: I am a clergyman -- a parson . ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 5]: `` Now you talk !
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 11]: You see my blind and straddle it like a man .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 5]: Put it there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 27]: -- extending a brawny paw , which closed over the minister 's small hand and gave it a shake indicative of fraternal sympathy and fervent gratification .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 9]: `` Now we 're all right , pard .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 5]: Let 's start fresh .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 18]: Do n't you mind my snuffling a little -- becuz we 're in a power of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 19]: You see , one of the boys has gone up the flume -- '' `` Gone where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 14]: `` Up the flume -- throwed up the sponge , you understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 7]: `` Thrown up the sponge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 25]: `` Yes -- kicked the bucket -- '' `` Ah -- has departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no traveler returns . ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 3]: `` Return !
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 4]: I reckon not .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 8]: Why pard , he 's dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 7]: `` Yes , I understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 6]: `` Oh , you do ?
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 12]: Well I thought maybe you might be getting tangled some more .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 13]: Yes , you see he 's dead again -- '' `` Again ?
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 10]: Why , has he ever been dead before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 4]: `` Dead before ?
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 14]: Do you reckon a man has got as many lives as a cat ?
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 24]: But you bet you he 's awful dead now , poor old boy , and I wish I 'd never seen this day .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 11]: I do n't want no better friend than Buck Fanshaw .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 26]: I knowed him by the back ; and when I know a man and like him , I freeze to him -- you hear me .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 17]: Take him all round , pard , there never was a bullier man in the mines .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 13]: No man ever knowed Buck Fanshaw to go back on a friend .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 14]: But it 's all up , you know , it 's all up .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 6]: It ai n't no use .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 6]: They 've scooped him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 5]: `` Scooped him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 6]: `` Yes -- death has .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 14]: Well , well , well , we 've got to give him up .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 3]: Yes indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 16]: It 's a kind of a hard world , after all , ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 8]: But pard , he was a rustler !
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 9]: You ought to seen him get started once .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 10]: He was a bully boy with a glass eye !
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 27]: Just spit in his face and give him room according to his strength , and it was just beautiful to see him peel and go in .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 13]: He was the worst son of a thief that ever drawed breath .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 7]: Pard , he was on it !
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 10]: He was on it bigger than an Injun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 4]: `` On it ?
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 4]: On what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 5]: `` On the shoot .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 4]: On the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 7]: On the fight , you understand .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 10]: He did n't give a continental for any body .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 41]: Beg your pardon , friend , for coming so near saying a cuss-word -- but you see I 'm on an awful strain , in this palaver , on account of having to cramp down and draw everything so mild .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 9]: But we 've got to give him up .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 13]: There ai n't any getting around that , I do n't reckon .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 18]: Now if we can get you to help plant him -- '' `` Preach the funeral discourse ?
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 6]: Assist at the obsequies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 7]: `` Obs ` quies is good .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 10]: That 's it -- that 's our little game .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 13]: We are going to get the thing up regardless , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 55]: He was always nifty himself , and so you bet you his funeral ai n't going to be no slouch -- solid silver door-plate on his coffin , six plumes on the hearse , and a nigger on the box in a biled shirt and a plug hat -- how 's that for high ?
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 10]: And we 'll take care of you , pard .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 7]: We 'll fix you all right .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 26]: There 'll be a kerridge for you ; and whatever you want , you just ` scape out and we 'll ` tend to it .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 26]: We 've got a shebang fixed up for you to stand behind , in No. 1 's house , and do n't you be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 16]: Just go in and toot your horn , if you do n't sell a clam .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 34]: Put Buck through as bully as you can , pard , for anybody that knowed him will tell you that he was one of the whitest men that was ever in the mines .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 8]: You ca n't draw it too strong .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 11]: He never could stand it to see things going wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 17]: He 's done more to make this town quiet and peaceable than any man in it .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 13]: I 've seen him lick four Greasers in eleven minutes , myself .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 31]: If a thing wanted regulating , he war n't a man to go browsing around after somebody to do it , but he would prance in and regulate it himself .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 6]: He war n't a Catholic .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 2]: Scasely .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 6]: He was down on 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 11]: His word was , ` No Irish need apply ! '
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 45]: But it did n't make no difference about that when it came down to what a man 's rights was -- and so , when some roughs jumped the Catholic bone-yard and started in to stake out town-lots in it he went for 'em !
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 7]: And he cleaned 'em , too !
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 13]: I was there , pard , and I seen it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 22]: `` That was very well indeed -- at least the impulse was -- whether the act was strictly defensible or not .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 6]: Had deceased any religious convictions ?
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 21]: That is to say , did he feel a dependence upon , or acknowledge allegiance to a higher power ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 3]: More reflection .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 11]: `` I reckon you 've stumped me again , pard .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 14]: Could you say it over once more , and say it slow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 36]: `` Well , to simplify it somewhat , was he , or rather had he ever been connected with any organization sequestered from secular concerns and devoted to self-sacrifice in the interests of morality ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 17]: `` All down but nine -- set 'em up on the other alley , pard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 10]: `` What did I understand you to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 14]: `` Why , you 're most too many for me , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 13]: When you get in with your left I hunt grass every time .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 18]: Every time you draw , you fill ; but I do n't seem to have any luck .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 7]: Lets have a new deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 4]: Begin again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 6]: `` That 's it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 29]: Was he a good man , and -- '' `` There -- I see that ; do n't put up another chip till I look at my hand .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 7]: A good man , says you ?
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 10]: Pard , it ai n't no name for it .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 18]: He was the best man that ever -- pard , you would have doted on that man .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 11]: He could lam any galoot of his inches in America .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 30]: It was him that put down the riot last election before it got a start ; and everybody said he was the only man that could have done it .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 30]: He waltzed in with a spanner in one hand and a trumpet in the other , and sent fourteen men home on a shutter in less than three minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 21]: He had that riot all broke up and prevented nice before anybody ever got a chance to strike a blow .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 18]: He was always for peace , and he would have peace -- he could not stand disturbances .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 11]: Pard , he was a great loss to this town .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 18]: It would please the boys if you could chip in something like that and do him justice .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 44]: Here once when the Micks got to throwing stones through the Methodis ' Sunday school windows , Buck Fanshaw , all of his own notion , shut up his saloon and took a couple of six-shooters and mounted guard over the Sunday school .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 10]: Says he , ` No Irish need apply ! '
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 5]: And they did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 11]: He was the bulliest man in the mountains , pard !
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 26]: He could run faster , jump higher , hit harder , and hold more tangle-foot whisky without spilling it than any man in seventeen counties .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 18]: Put that in , pard -- it 'll please the boys more than anything you could say .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 15]: And you can say , pard , that he never shook his mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 7]: `` Never shook his mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 15]: `` That 's it -- any of the boys will tell you so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 11]: `` Well , but why should he shake her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 13]: `` That 's what I say -- but some people does . ''
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 8]: `` Not people of any repute ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 10]: `` Well , some that averages pretty so-so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 36]: `` In my opinion the man that would offer personal violence to his own mother , ought to -- '' `` Cheese it , pard ; you 've banked your ball clean outside the string .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 24]: What I was a drivin ' at , was , that he never throwed off on his mother -- do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 3]: No indeedy .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 57]: He give her a house to live in , and town lots , and plenty of money ; and he looked after her and took care of her all the time ; and when she was down with the small-pox I 'm d -- d if he did n't set up nights and nuss her himself !
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 17]: Beg your pardon for saying it , but it hopped out too quick for yours truly .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 23]: `` You 've treated me like a gentleman , pard , and I ai n't the man to hurt your feelings intentional .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 6]: I think you 're white .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 10]: I think you 're a square man , pard .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 14]: I like you , and I 'll lick any man that do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 17]: I 'll lick him till he ca n't tell himself from a last year 's corpse !
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 5]: Put it there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 9]: -LSB- Another fraternal hand-shake -- and exit . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 12]: The obsequies were all that `` the boys '' could desire .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 13]: Such a marvel of funeral pomp had never been seen in Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 91]: The plumed hearse , the dirge-breathing brass bands , the closed marts of business , the flags drooping at half mast , the long , plodding procession of uniformed secret societies , military battalions and fire companies , draped engines , carriages of officials , and citizens in vehicles and on foot , attracted multitudes of spectators to the sidewalks , roofs and windows ; and for years afterward , the degree of grandeur attained by any civic display in Virginia was determined by comparison with Buck Fanshaw 's funeral .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 54]: Scotty Briggs , as a pall-bearer and a mourner , occupied a prominent place at the funeral , and when the sermon was finished and the last sentence of the prayer for the dead man 's soul ascended , he responded , in a low voice , but with feelings : `` AMEN .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 6]: No Irish need apply . ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 45]: As the bulk of the response was without apparent relevancy , it was probably nothing more than a humble tribute to the memory of the friend that was gone ; for , as Scotty had once said , it was `` his word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 60]: Scotty Briggs , in after days , achieved the distinction of becoming the only convert to religion that was ever gathered from the Virginia roughs ; and it transpired that the man who had it in him to espouse the quarrel of the weak out of inborn nobility of spirit was no mean timber whereof to construct a Christian .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 32]: The making him one did not warp his generosity or diminish his courage ; on the contrary it gave intelligent direction to the one and a broader field to the other .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 17]: If his Sunday-school class progressed faster than the other classes , was it matter for wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 4]: I think not .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 12]: He talked to his pioneer small-fry in a language they understood !
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 35]: It was my large privilege , a month before he died , to hear him tell the beautiful story of Joseph and his brethren to his class `` without looking at the book . ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 64]: I leave it to the reader to fancy what it was like , as it fell , riddled with slang , from the lips of that grave , earnest teacher , and was listened to by his little learners with a consuming interest that showed that they were as unconscious as he was that any violence was being done to the sacred proprieties !
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVIII .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 14]: The first twenty-six graves in the Virginia cemetery were occupied by murdered men .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 17]: So everybody said , so everybody believed , and so they will always say and believe .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 38]: The reason why there was so much slaughtering done , was , that in a new mining district the rough element predominates , and a person is not respected until he has `` killed his man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 7]: That was the very expression used .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 27]: If an unknown individual arrived , they did not inquire if he was capable , honest , industrious , but -- had he killed his man ?
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 41]: If he had not , he gravitated to his natural and proper position , that of a man of small consequence ; if he had , the cordiality of his reception was graduated according to the number of his dead .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 43]: It was tedious work struggling up to a position of influence with bloodless hands ; but when a man came with the blood of half a dozen men on his soul , his worth was recognized at once and his acquaintance sought .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 42]: In Nevada , for a time , the lawyer , the editor , the banker , the chief desperado , the chief gambler , and the saloon keeper , occupied the same level in society , and it was the highest .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 37]: The cheapest and easiest way to become an influential man and be looked up to by the community at large , was to stand behind a bar , wear a cluster-diamond pin , and sell whisky .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 20]: I am not sure but that the saloon-keeper held a shade higher rank than any other member of society .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 5]: His opinion had weight .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 12]: It was his privilege to say how the elections should go .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 14]: No great movement could succeed without the countenance and direction of the saloon-keepers .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 21]: It was a high favor when the chief saloon-keeper consented to serve in the legislature or the board of aldermen .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 28]: Youthful ambition hardly aspired so much to the honors of the law , or the army and navy as to the dignity of proprietorship in a saloon .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 13]: To be a saloon-keeper and kill a man was to be illustrious .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 49]: Hence the reader will not be surprised to learn that more than one man was killed in Nevada under hardly the pretext of provocation , so impatient was the slayer to achieve reputation and throw off the galling sense of being held in indifferent repute by his associates .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 25]: I knew two youths who tried to `` kill their men '' for no other reason -- and got killed themselves for their pains .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 35]: `` There goes the man that killed Bill Adams '' was higher praise and a sweeter sound in the ears of this sort of people than any other speech that admiring lips could utter .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 13]: The men who murdered Virginia 's original twenty-six cemetery-occupants were never punished .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 81]: Because Alfred the Great , when he invented trial by jury and knew that he had admirably framed it to secure justice in his age of the world , was not aware that in the nineteenth century the condition of things would be so entirely changed that unless he rose from the grave and altered the jury plan to meet the emergency , it would prove the most ingenious and infallible agency for defeating justice that human wisdom could contrive .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 44]: For how could he imagine that we simpletons would go on using his jury plan after circumstances had stripped it of its usefulness , any more than he could imagine that we would go on using his candle-clock after we had invented chronometers ?
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 69]: In his day news could not travel fast , and hence he could easily find a jury of honest , intelligent men who had not heard of the case they were called to try -- but in our day of telegraphs and newspapers his plan compels us to swear in juries composed of fools and rascals , because the system rigidly excludes honest men and men of brains .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 18]: I remember one of those sorrowful farces , in Virginia , which we call a jury trial .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 19]: A noted desperado killed Mr. B. , a good citizen , in the most wanton and cold-blooded way .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 20]: Of course the papers were full of it , and all men capable of reading , read about it .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 16]: And of course all men not deaf and dumb and idiotic , talked about it .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 43]: A jury-list was made out , and Mr. B. L. , a prominent banker and a valued citizen , was questioned precisely as he would have been questioned in any court in America : `` Have you heard of this homicide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 10]: `` Have you held conversations upon the subject ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 11]: `` Have you formed or expressed opinions about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 11]: `` Have you read the newspaper accounts of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 8]: `` We do not want you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 50]: A minister , intelligent , esteemed , and greatly respected ; a merchant of high character and known probity ; a mining superintendent of intelligence and unblemished reputation ; a quartz mill owner of excellent standing , were all questioned in the same way , and all set aside .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 41]: Each said the public talk and the newspaper reports had not so biased his mind but that sworn testimony would overthrow his previously formed opinions and enable him to render a verdict without prejudice and in accordance with the facts .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 13]: But of course such men could not be trusted with the case .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 8]: Ignoramuses alone could mete out unsullied justice .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 59]: When the peremptory challenges were all exhausted , a jury of twelve men was impaneled -- a jury who swore they had neither heard , read , talked about nor expressed an opinion concerning a murder which the very cattle in the corrals , the Indians in the sage-brush and the stones in the streets were cognizant of !
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 33]: It was a jury composed of two desperadoes , two low beer-house politicians , three bar-keepers , two ranchmen who could not read , and three dull , stupid , human donkeys !
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 21]: It actually came out afterward , that one of these latter thought that incest and arson were the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 11]: The verdict rendered by this jury was , Not Guilty .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 6]: What else could one expect ?
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 21]: The jury system puts a ban upon intelligence and honesty , and a premium upon ignorance , stupidity and perjury .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 22]: It is a shame that we must continue to use a worthless system because it was good a thousand years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 68]: In this age , when a gentleman of high social standing , intelligence and probity , swears that testimony given under solemn oath will outweigh , with him , street talk and newspaper reports based upon mere hearsay , he is worth a hundred jurymen who will swear to their own ignorance and stupidity , and justice would be far safer in his hands than in theirs .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 25]: Why could not the jury law be so altered as to give men of brains and honesty and equal chance with fools and miscreants ?
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 35]: Is it right to show the present favoritism to one class of men and inflict a disability on another , in a land whose boast is that all its citizens are free and equal ?
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 8]: I am a candidate for the legislature .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 9]: I desire to tamper with the jury law .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 34]: I wish to so alter it as to put a premium on intelligence and character , and close the jury box against idiots , blacklegs , and people who do not read newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 21]: But no doubt I shall be defeated -- every effort I make to save the country `` misses fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 24]: My idea , when I began this chapter , was to say something about desperadoism in the `` flush times '' of Nevada .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 29]: To attempt a portrayal of that era and that land , and leave out the blood and carnage , would be like portraying Mormondom and leaving out polygamy .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 39]: The desperado stalked the streets with a swagger graded according to the number of his homicides , and a nod of recognition from him was sufficient to make a humble admirer happy for the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 33]: The deference that was paid to a desperado of wide reputation , and who `` kept his private graveyard , '' as the phrase went , was marked , and cheerfully accorded .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 77]: When he moved along the sidewalk in his excessively long-tailed frock-coat , shiny stump-toed boots , and with dainty little slouch hat tipped over left eye , the small-fry roughs made room for his majesty ; when he entered the restaurant , the waiters deserted bankers and merchants to overwhelm him with obsequious service ; when he shouldered his way to a bar , the shouldered parties wheeled indignantly , recognized him , and -- apologized .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 52]: They got a look in return that froze their marrow , and by that time a curled and breast-pinned bar keeper was beaming over the counter , proud of the established acquaintanceship that permitted such a familiar form of speech as : `` How 're ye , Billy , old fel ?
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 5]: Glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 10]: What 'll you take -- the old thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 13]: The `` old thing '' meant his customary drink , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 20]: The best known names in the Territory of Nevada were those belonging to these long-tailed heroes of the revolver .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 70]: Orators , Governors , capitalists and leaders of the legislature enjoyed a degree of fame , but it seemed local and meagre when contrasted with the fame of such men as Sam Brown , Jack Williams , Billy Mulligan , Farmer Pease , Sugarfoot Mike , Pock Marked Jake , El Dorado Johnny , Jack McNabb , Joe McGee , Jack Harris , Six-fingered Pete , etc. , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 8]: There was a long list of them .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 16]: They were brave , reckless men , and traveled with their lives in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 55]: To give them their due , they did their killing principally among themselves , and seldom molested peaceable citizens , for they considered it small credit to add to their trophies so cheap a bauble as the death of a man who was `` not on the shoot , '' as they phrased it .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 39]: They killed each other on slight provocation , and hoped and expected to be killed themselves -- for they held it almost shame to die otherwise than `` with their boots on , '' as they expressed it .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 20]: I remember an instance of a desperado 's contempt for such small game as a private citizen 's life .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 31]: I was taking a late supper in a restaurant one night , with two reporters and a little printer named -- Brown , for instance -- any name will do .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 30]: Presently a stranger with a long-tailed coat on came in , and not noticing Brown 's hat , which was lying in a chair , sat down on it .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 11]: Little Brown sprang up and became abusive in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 30]: The stranger smiled , smoothed out the hat , and offered it to Brown with profuse apologies couched in caustic sarcasm , and begged Brown not to destroy him .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 47]: Brown threw off his coat and challenged the man to fight -- abused him , threatened him , impeached his courage , and urged and even implored him to fight ; and in the meantime the smiling stranger placed himself under our protection in mock distress .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 28]: But presently he assumed a serious tone , and said : `` Very well , gentlemen , if we must fight , we must , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 15]: But do n't rush into danger and then say I gave you no warning .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 15]: I am more than a match for all of you when I get started .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 23]: I will give you proofs , and then if my friend here still insists , I will try to accommodate him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 18]: The table we were sitting at was about five feet long , and unusually cumbersome and heavy .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 34]: He asked us to put our hands on the dishes and hold them in their places a moment -- one of them was a large oval dish with a portly roast on it .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 57]: Then he sat down , tilted up one end of the table , set two of the legs on his knees , took the end of the table between his teeth , took his hands away , and pulled down with his teeth till the table came up to a level position , dishes and all !
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 13]: He said he could lift a keg of nails with his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 15]: He picked up a common glass tumbler and bit a semi-circle out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 43]: Then he opened his bosom and showed us a net-work of knife and bullet scars ; showed us more on his arms and face , and said he believed he had bullets enough in his body to make a pig of lead .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 7]: He was armed to the teeth .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 23]: He closed with the remark that he was Mr. -- of Cariboo -- a celebrated name whereat we shook in our shoes .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 18]: I would publish the name , but for the suspicion that he might come and carve me .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 10]: He finally inquired if Brown still thirsted for blood .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 19]: Brown turned the thing over in his mind a moment , and then -- asked him to supper .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 33]: With the permission of the reader , I will group together , in the next chapter , some samples of life in our small mountain village in the old days of desperadoism .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 7]: I was there at the time .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 29]: The reader will observe peculiarities in our official society ; and he will observe also , an instance of how , in new countries , murders breed murders .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIX .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 24]: An extract or two from the newspapers of the day will furnish a photograph that can need no embellishment : FATAL SHOOTING AFFRAY .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 35]: -- An affray occurred , last evening , in a billiard saloon on C street , between Deputy Marshal Jack Williams and Wm. Brown , which resulted in the immediate death of the latter .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 12]: There had been some difficulty between the parties for several months .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 15]: An inquest was immediately held , and the following testimony adduced : Officer GEO .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 308]: BIRDSALL , sworn , says : -- I was told Wm. Brown was drunk and was looking for Jack Williams ; so soon as I heard that I started for the parties to prevent a collision ; went into the billiard saloon ; saw Billy Brown running around , saying if anybody had anything against him to show cause ; he was talking in a boisterous manner , and officer Perry took him to the other end of the room to talk to him ; Brown came back to me ; remarked to me that he thought he was as good as anybody , and knew how to take care of himself ; he passed by me and went to the bar ; do n't know whether he drank or not ; Williams was at the end of the billiard-table , next to the stairway ; Brown , after going to the bar , came back and said he was as good as any man in the world ; he had then walked out to the end of the first billiard-table from the bar ; I moved closer to them , supposing there would be a fight ; as Brown drew his pistol I caught hold of it ; he had fired one shot at Williams ; do n't know the effect of it ; caught hold of him with one hand , and took hold of the pistol and turned it up ; think he fired once after I caught hold of the pistol ; I wrenched the pistol from him ; walked to the end of the billiard-table and told a party that I had Brown 's pistol , and to stop shooting ; I think four shots were fired in all ; after walking out , Mr. Foster remarked that Brown was shot dead .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 18]: Oh , there was no excitement about it -- he merely `` remarked '' the small circumstance !
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 16]: Four months later the following item appeared in the same paper -LRB- the Enterprise -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 28]: In this item the name of one of the city officers above referred to -LRB- Deputy Marshal Jack Williams -RRB- occurs again : ROBBERY AND DESPERATE AFFRAY .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 33]: -- On Tuesday night , a German named Charles Hurtzal , engineer in a mill at Silver City , came to this place , and visited the hurdy-gurdy house on B street .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 21]: The music , dancing and Teutonic maidens awakened memories of Faderland until our German friend was carried away with rapture .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 11]: He evidently had money , and was spending if freely .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 20]: Late in the evening Jack Williams and Andy Blessington invited him down stairs to take a cup of coffee .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 21]: Williams proposed a game of cards and went up stairs to procure a deck , but not finding any returned .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 24]: On the stairway he met the German , and drawing his pistol knocked him down and rifled his pockets of some seventy dollars .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 34]: Hurtzal dared give no alarm , as he was told , with a pistol at his head , if he made any noise or exposed them , they would blow his brains out .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 17]: So effectually was he frightened that he made no complaint , until his friends forced him .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 12]: Yesterday a warrant was issued , but the culprits had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 23]: This efficient city officer , Jack Williams , had the common reputation of being a burglar , a highwayman and a desperado .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 28]: It was said that he had several times drawn his revolver and levied money contributions on citizens at dead of night in the public streets of Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 40]: Five months after the above item appeared , Williams was assassinated while sitting at a card table one night ; a gun was thrust through the crack of the door and Williams dropped from his chair riddled with balls .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 65]: It was said , at the time , that Williams had been for some time aware that a party of his own sort -LRB- desperadoes -RRB- had sworn away his life ; and it was generally believed among the people that Williams 's friends and enemies would make the assassination memorable -- and useful , too -- by a wholesale destruction of each other .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 52]: It did not so happen , but still , times were not dull during the next twenty-four hours , for within that time a woman was killed by a pistol shot , a man was brained with a slung shot , and a man named Reeder was also disposed of permanently .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 27]: Some matters in the Enterprise account of the killing of Reeder are worth nothing -- especially the accommodating complaisance of a Virginia justice of the peace .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 14]: The italics in the following narrative are mine : MORE CUTTING AND SHOOTING .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 13]: -- The devil seems to have again broken loose in our town .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 15]: Pistols and guns explode and knives gleam in our streets as in early times .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 32]: When there has been a long season of quiet , people are slow to wet their hands in blood ; but once blood is spilled , cutting and shooting come easy .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 37]: Night before last Jack Williams was assassinated , and yesterday forenoon we had more bloody work , growing out of the killing of Williams , and on the same street in which he met his death .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 59]: It appears that Tom Reeder , a friend of Williams , and George Gumbert were talking , at the meat market of the latter , about the killing of Williams the previous night , when Reeder said it was a most cowardly act to shoot a man in such a way , giving him `` no show . ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 26]: Gumbert said that Williams had `` as good a show as he gave Billy Brown , '' meaning the man killed by Williams last March .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 18]: Reeder said it was a d -- d lie , that Williams had no show at all .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 20]: At this , Gumbert drew a knife and stabbed Reeder , cutting him in two places in the back .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 49]: One stroke of the knife cut into the sleeve of Reeder 's coat and passed downward in a slanting direction through his clothing , and entered his body at the small of the back ; another blow struck more squarely , and made a much more dangerous wound .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 35]: Gumbert gave himself up to the officers of justice , and was shortly after discharged by Justice Atwill , on his own recognizance , to appear for trial at six o'clock in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 21]: In the meantime Reeder had been taken into the office of Dr. Owens , where his wounds were properly dressed .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 21]: One of his wounds was considered quite dangerous , and it was thought by many that it would prove fatal .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 30]: But being considerably under the influence of liquor , Reeder did not feel his wounds as he otherwise would , and he got up and went into the street .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 17]: He went to the meat market and renewed his quarrel with Gumbert , threatening his life .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 20]: Friends tried to interfere to put a stop to the quarrel and get the parties away from each other .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 40]: In the Fashion Saloon Reeder made threats against the life of Gumbert , saying he would kill him , and it is said that he requested the officers not to arrest Gumbert , as he intended to kill him .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 25]: After these threats Gumbert went off and procured a double-barreled shot gun , loaded with buck-shot or revolver balls , and went after Reeder .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 48]: Two or three persons were assisting him along the street , trying to get him home , and had him just in front of the store of Klopstock & Harris , when Gumbert came across toward him from the opposite side of the street with his gun .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 24]: He came up within about ten or fifteen feet of Reeder , and called out to those with him to `` look out !
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 7]: get out of the way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 14]: and they had only time to heed the warning , when he fired .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 55]: Reeder was at the time attempting to screen himself behind a large cask , which stood against the awning post of Klopstock & Harris 's store , but some of the balls took effect in the lower part of his breast , and he reeled around forward and fell in front of the cask .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 19]: Gumbert then raised his gun and fired the second barrel , which missed Reeder and entered the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 51]: At the time that this occurred , there were a great many persons on the street in the vicinity , and a number of them called out to Gumbert , when they saw him raise his gun , to `` hold on , '' and `` do n't shoot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 13]: The cutting took place about ten o'clock and the shooting about twelve .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 40]: After the shooting the street was instantly crowded with the inhabitants of that part of the town , some appearing much excited and laughing -- declaring that it looked like the `` good old times of ' 60 . ''
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 32]: Marshal Perry and officer Birdsall were near when the shooting occurred , and Gumbert was immediately arrested and his gun taken from him , when he was marched off to jail .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 67]: Many persons who were attracted to the spot where this bloody work had just taken place , looked bewildered and seemed to be asking themselves what was to happen next , appearing in doubt as to whether the killing mania had reached its climax , or whether we were to turn in and have a grand killing spell , shooting whoever might have given us offence .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 23]: It was whispered around that it was not all over yet -- five or six more were to be killed before night .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 18]: Reeder was taken to the Virginia City Hotel , and doctors called in to examine his wounds .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 34]: They found that two or three balls had entered his right side ; one of them appeared to have passed through the substance of the lungs , while another passed into the liver .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 13]: Two balls were also found to have struck one of his legs .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 35]: As some of the balls struck the cask , the wounds in Reeder 's leg were probably from these , glancing downwards , though they might have been caused by the second shot fired .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 31]: After being shot , Reeder said when he got on his feet -- smiling as he spoke -- `` It will take better shooting than that to kill me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 35]: The doctors consider it almost impossible for him to recover , but as he has an excellent constitution he may survive , notwithstanding the number and dangerous character of the wounds he has received .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 36]: The town appears to be perfectly quiet at present , as though the late stormy times had cleared our moral atmosphere ; but who can tell in what quarter clouds are lowering or plots ripening ?
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 17]: Reeder -- or at least what was left of him -- survived his wounds two days !
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 7]: Nothing was ever done with Gumbert .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 10]: Trial by jury is the palladium of our liberties .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 27]: I do not know what a palladium is , having never seen a palladium , but it is a good thing no doubt at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 42]: Not less than a hundred men have been murdered in Nevada -- perhaps I would be within bounds if I said three hundred -- and as far as I can learn , only two persons have suffered the death penalty there .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 32]: However , four or five who had no money and no political influence have been punished by imprisonment -- one languished in prison as much as eight months , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 16]: However , I do not desire to be extravagant -- it may have been less .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 11]: However , one prophecy was verified , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 74]: It was asserted by the desperadoes that one of their brethren -LRB- Joe McGee , a special policeman -RRB- was known to be the conspirator chosen by lot to assassinate Williams ; and they also asserted that doom had been pronounced against McGee , and that he would be assassinated in exactly the same manner that had been adopted for the destruction of Williams -- a prophecy which came true a year later .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 35]: After twelve months of distress -LRB- for McGee saw a fancied assassin in every man that approached him -RRB- , he made the last of many efforts to get out of the country unwatched .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 25]: He went to Carson and sat down in a saloon to wait for the stage -- it would leave at four in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 25]: But as the night waned and the crowd thinned , he grew uneasy , and told the bar-keeper that assassins were on his track .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 29]: The bar-keeper told him to stay in the middle of the room , then , and not go near the door , or the window by the stove .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 37]: But a fatal fascination seduced him to the neighborhood of the stove every now and then , and repeatedly the bar-keeper brought him back to the middle of the room and warned him to remain there .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 5]: But he could not .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 18]: At three in the morning he again returned to the stove and sat down by a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 32]: Before the bar-keeper could get to him with another warning whisper , some one outside fired through the window and riddled McGee 's breast with slugs , killing him almost instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 25]: By the same discharge the stranger at McGee 's side also received attentions which proved fatal in the course of two or three days .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 3]: CHAPTER L .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 53]: These murder and jury statistics remind me of a certain very extraordinary trial and execution of twenty years ago ; it is a scrap of history familiar to all old Californians , and worthy to be known by other peoples of the earth that love simple , straightforward justice unencumbered with nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 24]: I would apologize for this digression but for the fact that the information I am about to offer is apology enough in itself .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 23]: And since I digress constantly anyhow , perhaps it is as well to eschew apologies altogether and thus prevent their growing irksome .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 49]: Capt. Ned Blakely -- that name will answer as well as any other fictitious one -LRB- for he was still with the living at last accounts , and may not desire to be famous -RRB- -- sailed ships out of the harbor of San Francisco for many years .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 25]: He was a stalwart , warm-hearted , eagle-eyed veteran , who had been a sailor nearly fifty years -- a sailor from early boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 22]: He was a rough , honest creature , full of pluck , and just as full of hard-headed simplicity , too .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 15]: He hated trifling conventionalities -- `` business '' was the word , with him .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 37]: He had all a sailor 's vindictiveness against the quips and quirks of the law , and steadfastly believed that the first and last aim and object of the law and lawyers was to defeat justice .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 13]: He sailed for the Chincha Islands in command of a guano ship .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 26]: He had a fine crew , but his negro mate was his pet -- on him he had for years lavished his admiration and esteem .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 45]: It was Capt. Ned 's first voyage to the Chinchas , but his fame had gone before him -- the fame of being a man who would fight at the dropping of a handkerchief , when imposed upon , and would stand no nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 7]: It was a fame well earned .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 30]: Arrived in the islands , he found that the staple of conversation was the exploits of one Bill Noakes , a bully , the mate of a trading ship .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 11]: This man had created a small reign of terror there .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 20]: At nine o'clock at night , Capt. Ned , all alone , was pacing his deck in the starlight .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 10]: A form ascended the side , and approached him .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 10]: Capt. Ned said : `` Who goes there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 14]: `` I 'm Bill Noakes , the best man in the islands . ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 10]: `` What do you want aboard this ship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 32]: `` I 've heard of Capt. Ned Blakely , and one of us is a better man than ` tother -- I 'll know which , before I go ashore . ''
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 14]: `` You 've come to the right shop -- I 'm your man .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 14]: I 'll learn you to come aboard this ship without an invite . ''
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 23]: He seized Noakes , backed him against the mainmast , pounded his face to a pulp , and then threw him overboard .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 5]: Noakes was not convinced .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 20]: He returned the next night , got the pulp renewed , and went overboard head first , as before .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 4]: He was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 37]: A week after this , while Noakes was carousing with a sailor crowd on shore , at noonday , Capt. Ned 's colored mate came along , and Noakes tried to pick a quarrel with him .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 12]: The negro evaded the trap , and tried to get away .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 22]: Noakes followed him up ; the negro began to run ; Noakes fired on him with a revolver and killed him .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 9]: Half a dozen sea-captains witnessed the whole affair .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 31]: Noakes retreated to the small after-cabin of his ship , with two other bullies , and gave out that death would be the portion of any man that intruded there .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 28]: There was no attempt made to follow the villains ; there was no disposition to do it , and indeed very little thought of such an enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 41]: There were no courts and no officers ; there was no government ; the islands belonged to Peru , and Peru was far away ; she had no official representative on the ground ; and neither had any other nation .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 13]: However , Capt. Ned was not perplexing his head about such things .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 5]: They concerned him not .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 10]: He was boiling with rage and furious for justice .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 34]: At nine o'clock at night he loaded a double-barreled gun with slugs , fished out a pair of handcuffs , got a ship 's lantern , summoned his quartermaster , and went ashore .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 15]: He said : `` Do you see that ship there at the dock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 6]: `` Ay-ay , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 7]: `` It 's the Venus . ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 6]: `` Ay-ay , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 8]: `` You -- you know me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 6]: `` Ay-ay , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 6]: `` Very well , then .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 4]: Take the lantern .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 7]: Carry it just under your chin .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 20]: I 'll walk behind you and rest this gun-barrel on your shoulder , p ` inting forward -- so .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 16]: Keep your lantern well up so 's I can see things ahead of you good .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 19]: I 'm going to march in on Noakes -- and take him -- and jug the other chaps .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 11]: If you flinch -- well , you know me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 6]: `` Ay-ay , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 33]: In this order they filed aboard softly , arrived at Noakes 's den , the quartermaster pushed the door open , and the lantern revealed the three desperadoes sitting on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 10]: Capt. Ned said : `` I 'm Ned Blakely .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 7]: I 've got you under fire .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 11]: Do n't you move without orders -- any of you .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 15]: You two kneel down in the corner ; faces to the wall -- now .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 13]: Bill Noakes , put these handcuffs on ; now come up close .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 5]: Quartermaster , fasten 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 3]: All right .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 6]: Do n't stir , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 12]: Quartermaster , put the key in the outside of the door .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 31]: Now , men , I 'm going to lock you two in ; and if you try to burst through this door -- well , you 've heard of me .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 10]: Bill Noakes , fall in ahead , and march .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 3]: All set .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 7]: Quartermaster , lock the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 16]: Noakes spent the night on board Blakely 's ship , a prisoner under strict guard .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 42]: Early in the morning Capt. Ned called in all the sea-captains in the harbor and invited them , with nautical ceremony , to be present on board his ship at nine o'clock to witness the hanging of Noakes at the yard-arm !
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 8]: The man has not been tried . ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 7]: `` Of course he has n't .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 9]: But did n't he kill the nigger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 18]: `` Certainly he did ; but you are not thinking of hanging him without a trial ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 3]: `` Trial !
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 16]: What do I want to try him for , if he killed the nigger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 11]: `` Oh , Capt. Ned , this will never do .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 7]: Think how it will sound . ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 5]: `` Sound be hanged !
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 8]: Did n't he kill the nigger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 30]: `` Certainly , certainly , Capt. Ned , -- nobody denies that , -- but -- '' `` Then I 'm going to hang him , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 13]: Everybody I 've talked to talks just the same way you do .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 26]: Everybody says he killed the nigger , everybody knows he killed the nigger , and yet every lubber of you wants him tried for it .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 10]: I do n't understand such bloody foolishness as that .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 2]: Tried !
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 71]: Mind you , I do n't object to trying him , if it 's got to be done to give satisfaction ; and I 'll be there , and chip in and help , too ; but put it off till afternoon -- put it off till afternoon , for I 'll have my hands middling full till after the burying -- '' `` Why , what do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 15]: Are you going to hang him any how -- and try him afterward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 12]: `` Did n't I say I was going to hang him ?
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 8]: I never saw such people as you .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 5]: What 's the difference ?
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 16]: You ask a favor , and then you ai n't satisfied when you get it .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 15]: Before or after 's all one -- you know how the trial will go .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 5]: He killed the nigger .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 7]: Say -- I must be going .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 15]: If your mate would like to come to the hanging , fetch him along .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 5]: I like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 8]: There was a stir in the camp .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 18]: The captains came in a body and pleaded with Capt. Ned not to do this rash thing .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 53]: They promised that they would create a court composed of captains of the best character ; they would empanel a jury ; they would conduct everything in a way becoming the serious nature of the business in hand , and give the case an impartial hearing and the accused a fair trial .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 25]: And they said it would be murder , and punishable by the American courts if he persisted and hung the accused on his ship .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 4]: They pleaded hard .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 17]: Capt. Ned said : `` Gentlemen , I 'm not stubborn and I 'm not unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 14]: I 'm always willing to do just as near right as I can .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 7]: How long will it take ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 8]: `` Probably only a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 20]: `` And can I take him up the shore and hang him as soon as you are done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 15]: `` If he is proven guilty he shall be hanged without unnecessary delay . ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 7]: `` If he 's proven guilty .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 8]: Great Neptune , ai n't he guilty ?
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 5]: This beats my time .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 9]: Why you all know he 's guilty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 13]: But at last they satisfied him that they were projecting nothing underhanded .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 10]: Then he said : `` Well , all right .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 43]: You go on and try him and I 'll go down and overhaul his conscience and prepare him to go -- like enough he needs it , and I do n't want to send him off without a show for hereafter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 5]: This was another obstacle .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 15]: They finally convinced him that it was necessary to have the accused in court .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 12]: Then they said they would send a guard to bring him .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 21]: `` No , sir , I prefer to fetch him myself -- he do n't get out of my hands .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 18]: Besides , I 've got to go to the ship to get a rope , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 34]: The court assembled with due ceremony , empaneled a jury , and presently Capt. Ned entered , leading the prisoner with one hand and carrying a Bible and a rope in the other .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 22]: He seated himself by the side of his captive and told the court to `` up anchor and make sail . ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 20]: Then he turned a searching eye on the jury , and detected Noakes 's friends , the two bullies .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 19]: He strode over and said to them confidentially : `` You 're here to interfere , you see .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 9]: Now you vote right , do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 29]: -- or else there 'll be a double-barreled inquest here when this trial 's off , and your remainders will go home in a couple of baskets . ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 7]: The caution was not without fruit .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 9]: The jury was a unit -- the verdict .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 4]: `` Guilty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 24]: Capt. Ned sprung to his feet and said : `` Come along -- you 're my meat now , my lad , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 7]: Gentlemen you 've done yourselves proud .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 15]: I invite you all to come and see that I do it all straight .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 12]: Follow me to the canyon , a mile above here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 26]: The court informed him that a sheriff had been appointed to do the hanging , and -- Capt. Ned 's patience was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 5]: His wrath was boundless .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 9]: The subject of a sheriff was judiciously dropped .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 26]: When the crowd arrived at the canyon , Capt. Ned climbed a tree and arranged the halter , then came down and noosed his man .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 11]: He opened his Bible , and laid aside his hat .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 21]: Selecting a chapter at random , he read it through , in a deep bass voice and with sincere solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 41]: Then he said : `` Lad , you are about to go aloft and give an account of yourself ; and the lighter a man 's manifest is , as far as sin 's concerned , the better for him .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 18]: Make a clean breast , man , and carry a log with you that 'll bear inspection .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 6]: You killed the nigger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 3]: No reply .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 4]: A long pause .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 18]: The captain read another chapter , pausing , from time to time , to impress the effect .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 26]: Then he talked an earnest , persuasive sermon to him , and ended by repeating the question : `` Did you kill the nigger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 9]: No reply -- other than a malignant scowl .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 37]: The captain now read the first and second chapters of Genesis , with deep feeling -- paused a moment , closed the book reverently , and said with a perceptible savor of satisfaction : `` There .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 3]: Four chapters .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 16]: There 's few that would have took the pains with you that I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 34]: Then he swung up the condemned , and made the rope fast ; stood by and timed him half an hour with his watch , and then delivered the body to the court .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 51]: A little after , as he stood contemplating the motionless figure , a doubt came into his face ; evidently he felt a twinge of conscience -- a misgiving -- and he said with a sigh : `` Well , p ` raps I ought to burnt him , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 11]: But I was trying to do for the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 37]: When the history of this affair reached California -LRB- it was in the `` early days '' -RRB- it made a deal of talk , but did not diminish the captain 's popularity in any degree .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 6]: It increased it , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 33]: California had a population then that `` inflicted '' justice after a fashion that was simplicity and primitiveness itself , and could therefore admire appreciatively when the same fashion was followed elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 3]: CHAPTER LI .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 13]: Vice flourished luxuriantly during the hey-day of our `` flush times . ''
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 40]: The saloons were overburdened with custom ; so were the police courts , the gambling dens , the brothels and the jails -- unfailing signs of high prosperity in a mining region -- in any region for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 5]: Is it not so ?
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 19]: A crowded police court docket is the surest of all signs that trade is brisk and money plenty .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 32]: Still , there is one other sign ; it comes last , but when it does come it establishes beyond cavil that the `` flush times '' are at the flood .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 11]: This is the birth of the `` literary '' paper .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 16]: The Weekly Occidental , `` devoted to literature , '' made its appearance in Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 11]: All the literary people were engaged to write for it .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 7]: Mr. F. was to edit it .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 24]: He was a felicitous skirmisher with a pen , and a man who could say happy things in a crisp , neat way .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 107]: Once , while editor of the Union , he had disposed of a labored , incoherent , two-column attack made upon him by a contemporary , with a single line , which , at first glance , seemed to contain a solemn and tremendous compliment -- viz. : `` THE LOGIC OF OUR ADVERSARY RESEMBLES THE PEACE OF GOD , '' -- and left it to the reader 's memory and after-thought to invest the remark with another and `` more different '' meaning by supplying for himself and at his own leisure the rest of the Scripture -- `` in that it passeth understanding . ''
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 64]: He once said of a little , half-starved , wayside community that had no subsistence except what they could get by preying upon chance passengers who stopped over with them a day when traveling by the overland stage , that in their Church service they had altered the Lord 's Prayer to read : `` Give us this day our daily stranger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 8]: We expected great things of the Occidental .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 29]: Of course it could not get along without an original novel , and so we made arrangements to hurl into the work the full strength of the company .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 30]: Mrs. F. was an able romancist of the ineffable school -- I know no other name to apply to a school whose heroes are all dainty and all perfect .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 29]: She wrote the opening chapter , and introduced a lovely blonde simpleton who talked nothing but pearls and poetry and who was virtuous to the verge of eccentricity .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 17]: She also introduced a young French Duke of aggravated refinement , in love with the blonde .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 43]: Mr. F. followed next week , with a brilliant lawyer who set about getting the Duke 's estates into trouble , and a sparkling young lady of high society who fell to fascinating the Duke and impairing the appetite of the blonde .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 79]: Mr. D. , a dark and bloody editor of one of the dailies , followed Mr. F. , the third week , introducing a mysterious Roscicrucian who transmuted metals , held consultations with the devil in a cave at dead of night , and cast the horoscope of the several heroes and heroines in such a way as to provide plenty of trouble for their future careers and breed a solemn and awful public interest in the novel .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 30]: He also introduced a cloaked and masked melodramatic miscreant , put him on a salary and set him on the midnight track of the Duke with a poisoned dagger .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 30]: He also created an Irish coachman with a rich brogue and placed him in the service of the society-young-lady with an ulterior mission to carry billet-doux to the Duke .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 33]: About this time there arrived in Virginia a dissolute stranger with a literary turn of mind -- rather seedy he was , but very quiet and unassuming ; almost diffident , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 34]: He was so gentle , and his manners were so pleasing and kindly , whether he was sober or intoxicated , that he made friends of all who came in contact with him .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 32]: He applied for literary work , offered conclusive evidence that he wielded an easy and practiced pen , and so Mr. F. engaged him at once to help write the novel .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 16]: His chapter was to follow Mr. D. 's , and mine was to come next .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 41]: Now what does this fellow do but go off and get drunk and then proceed to his quarters and set to work with his imagination in a state of chaos , and that chaos in a condition of extravagant activity .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 6]: The result may be guessed .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 289]: He scanned the chapters of his predecessors , found plenty of heroes and heroines already created , and was satisfied with them ; he decided to introduce no more ; with all the confidence that whisky inspires and all the easy complacency it gives to its servant , he then launched himself lovingly into his work : he married the coachman to the society-young-lady for the sake of the scandal ; married the Duke to the blonde 's stepmother , for the sake of the sensation ; stopped the desperado 's salary ; created a misunderstanding between the devil and the Roscicrucian ; threw the Duke 's property into the wicked lawyer 's hands ; made the lawyer 's upbraiding conscience drive him to drink , thence to delirium tremens , thence to suicide ; broke the coachman 's neck ; let his widow succumb to contumely , neglect , poverty and consumption ; caused the blonde to drown herself , leaving her clothes on the bank with the customary note pinned to them forgiving the Duke and hoping he would be happy ; revealed to the Duke , by means of the usual strawberry mark on left arm , that he had married his own long-lost mother and destroyed his long-lost sister ; instituted the proper and necessary suicide of the Duke and the Duchess in order to compass poetical justice ; opened the earth and let the Roscicrucian through , accompanied with the accustomed smoke and thunder and smell of brimstone , and finished with the promise that in the next chapter , after holding a general inquest , he would take up the surviving character of the novel and tell what became of the devil !
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 22]: It read with singular smoothness , and with a `` dead '' earnestness that was funny enough to suffocate a body .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 9]: But there was war when it came in .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 6]: The other novelists were furious .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 47]: The mild stranger , not yet more than half sober , stood there , under a scathing fire of vituperation , meek and bewildered , looking from one to another of his assailants , and wondering what he could have done to invoke such a storm .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 63]: When a lull came at last , he said his say gently and appealingly -- said he did not rightly remember what he had written , but was sure he had tried to do the best he could , and knew his object had been to make the novel not only pleasant and plausible but instructive and -- The bombardment began again .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 17]: The novelists assailed his ill-chosen adjectives and demolished them with a storm of denunciation and ridicule .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 7]: And so the siege went on .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 15]: Every time the stranger tried to appease the enemy he only made matters worse .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 8]: Finally he offered to rewrite the chapter .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 4]: This arrested hostilities .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 23]: The indignation gradually quieted down , peace reigned again and the sufferer retired in safety and got him to his own citadel .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 16]: But on the way thither the evil angel tempted him and he got drunk again .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 7]: And again his imagination went mad .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 33]: He led the heroes and heroines a wilder dance than ever ; and yet all through it ran that same convincing air of honesty and earnestness that had marked his first work .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 26]: He got the characters into the most extraordinary situations , put them through the most surprising performances , and made them talk the strangest talk !
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 8]: But the chapter can not be described .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 24]: It was symmetrically crazy ; it was artistically absurd ; and it had explanatory footnotes that were fully as curious as the text .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 20]: I remember one of the `` situations , '' and will offer it as an example of the whole .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 32]: He altered the character of the brilliant lawyer , and made him a great-hearted , splendid fellow ; gave him fame and riches , and set his age at thirty-three years .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 41]: Then he made the blonde discover , through the help of the Roscicrucian and the melodramatic miscreant , that while the Duke loved her money ardently and wanted it , he secretly felt a sort of leaning toward the society-young-lady .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 27]: Stung to the quick , she tore her affections from him and bestowed them with tenfold power upon the lawyer , who responded with consuming zeal .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 8]: But the parents would none of it .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 33]: What they wanted in the family was a Duke ; and a Duke they were determined to have ; though they confessed that next to the Duke the lawyer had their preference .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 9]: Necessarily the blonde now went into a decline .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 5]: The parents were alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 18]: They pleaded with her to marry the Duke , but she steadfastly refused , and pined on .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 6]: Then they laid a plan .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 40]: They told her to wait a year and a day , and if at the end of that time she still felt that she could not marry the Duke , she might marry the lawyer with their full consent .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 19]: The result was as they had foreseen : gladness came again , and the flush of returning health .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 11]: Then the parents took the next step in their scheme .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 35]: They had the family physician recommend a long sea voyage and much land travel for the thorough restoration of the blonde 's strength ; and they invited the Duke to be of the party .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 27]: They judged that the Duke 's constant presence and the lawyer 's protracted absence would do the rest -- for they did not invite the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 40]: So they set sail in a steamer for America -- and the third day out , when their sea-sickness called truce and permitted them to take their first meal at the public table , behold there sat the lawyer !
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 22]: The Duke and party made the best of an awkward situation ; the voyage progressed , and the vessel neared America .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 38]: But , by and by , two hundred miles off New Bedford , the ship took fire ; she burned to the water 's edge ; of all her crew and passengers , only thirty were saved .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 13]: They floated about the sea half an afternoon and all night long .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 6]: Among them were our friends .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 34]: The lawyer , by superhuman exertions , had saved the blonde and her parents , swimming back and forth two hundred yards and bringing one each time -- -LRB- the girl first -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 6]: The Duke had saved himself .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 15]: In the morning two whale ships arrived on the scene and sent their boats .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 15]: The weather was stormy and the embarkation was attended with much confusion and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 68]: The lawyer did his duty like a man ; helped his exhausted and insensible blonde , her parents and some others into a boat -LRB- the Duke helped himself in -RRB- ; then a child fell overboard at the other end of the raft and the lawyer rushed thither and helped half a dozen people fish it out , under the stimulus of its mother 's screams .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 19]: Then he ran back -- a few seconds too late -- the blonde 's boat was under way .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 16]: So he had to take the other boat , and go to the other ship .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 20]: The storm increased and drove the vessels out of sight of each other -- drove them whither it would .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 33]: When it calmed , at the end of three days , the blonde 's ship was seven hundred miles north of Boston and the other about seven hundred south of that port .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 34]: The blonde 's captain was bound on a whaling cruise in the North Atlantic and could not go back such a distance or make a port without orders ; such being nautical law .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 25]: The lawyer 's captain was to cruise in the North Pacific , and he could not go back or make a port without orders .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 34]: All the lawyer 's money and baggage were in the blonde 's boat and went to the blonde 's ship -- so his captain made him work his passage as a common sailor .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 26]: When both ships had been cruising nearly a year , the one was off the coast of Greenland and the other in Behring 's Strait .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 60]: The blonde had long ago been well-nigh persuaded that her lawyer had been washed overboard and lost just before the whale ships reached the raft , and now , under the pleadings of her parents and the Duke she was at last beginning to nerve herself for the doom of the covenant , and prepare for the hated marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 12]: But she would not yield a day before the date set .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 29]: The weeks dragged on , the time narrowed , orders were given to deck the ship for the wedding -- a wedding at sea among icebergs and walruses .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 9]: Five days more and all would be over .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 12]: So the blonde reflected , with a sigh and a tear .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 19]: Oh where was her true love -- and why , why did he not come and save her ?
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 45]: At that moment he was lifting his harpoon to strike a whale in Behring 's Strait , five thousand miles away , by the way of the Arctic Ocean , or twenty thousand by the way of the Horn -- that was the reason .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 26]: He struck , but not with perfect aim -- his foot slipped and he fell in the whale 's mouth and went down his throat .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 6]: He was insensible five days .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 22]: Then he came to himself and heard voices ; daylight was streaming through a hole cut in the whale 's roof .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 17]: He climbed out and astonished the sailors who were hoisting blubber up a ship 's side .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 27]: He recognized the vessel , flew aboard , surprised the wedding party at the altar and exclaimed : `` Stop the proceedings -- I 'm here !
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 9]: Come to my arms , my own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 121]: There were foot-notes to this extravagant piece of literature wherein the author endeavored to show that the whole thing was within the possibilities ; he said he got the incident of the whale traveling from Behring 's Strait to the coast of Greenland , five thousand miles in five days , through the Arctic Ocean , from Charles Reade 's `` Love Me Little Love Me Long , '' and considered that that established the fact that the thing could be done ; and he instanced Jonah 's adventure as proof that a man could live in a whale 's belly , and added that if a preacher could stand it three days a lawyer could surely stand it five !
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 28]: There was a fiercer storm than ever in the editorial sanctum now , and the stranger was peremptorily discharged , and his manuscript flung at his head .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 34]: But he had already delayed things so much that there was not time for some one else to rewrite the chapter , and so the paper came out without any novel in it .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 48]: It was but a feeble , struggling , stupid journal , and the absence of the novel probably shook public confidence ; at any rate , before the first side of the next issue went to press , the Weekly Occidental died as peacefully as an infant .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 127]: An effort was made to resurrect it , with the proposed advantage of a telling new title , and Mr. F. said that The Phenix would be just the name for it , because it would give the idea of a resurrection from its dead ashes in a new and undreamed of condition of splendor ; but some low-priced smarty on one of the dailies suggested that we call it the Lazarus ; and inasmuch as the people were not profound in Scriptural matters but thought the resurrected Lazarus and the dilapidated mendicant that begged in the rich man 's gateway were one and the same person , the name became the laughing stock of the town , and killed the paper for good and all .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 30]: I was sorry enough , for I was very proud of being connected with a literary paper -- prouder than I have ever been of anything since , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 47]: I had written some rhymes for it -- poetry I considered it -- and it was a great grief to me that the production was on the `` first side '' of the issue that was not completed , and hence did not see the light .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 30]: But time brings its revenges -- I can put it in here ; it will answer in place of a tear dropped to the memory of the lost Occidental .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 36]: The idea -LRB- not the chief idea , but the vehicle that bears it -RRB- was probably suggested by the old song called `` The Raging Canal , '' but I can not remember now .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 29]: I do remember , though , that at that time I thought my doggerel was one of the ablest poems of the age : THE AGED PILOT MAN .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 26]: On the Erie Canal , it was , All on a summer 's day , I sailed forth with my parents Far away to Albany .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 27]: From out the clouds at noon that day There came a dreadful storm , That piled the billows high about , And filled us with alarm .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 30]: A man came rushing from a house , Saying , `` Snub up your boat I pray , -LSB- The customary canal technicality for ` tie up . ' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 18]: Snub up your boat , snub up , alas , Snub up while yet you may . ''
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 28]: Our captain cast one glance astern , Then forward glanced he , And said , `` My wife and little ones I never more shall see . ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 31]: Said Dollinger the pilot man , In noble words , but few , -- `` Fear not , but lean on Dollinger , And he will fetch you through . ''
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 29]: The boat drove on , the frightened mules Tore through the rain and wind , And bravely still , in danger 's post , The whip-boy strode behind .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 37]: `` Come ` board , come ` board , '' the captain cried , `` Nor tempt so wild a storm ; '' But still the raging mules advanced , And still the boy strode on .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 30]: Then said the captain to us all , `` Alas , 't is plain to me , The greater danger is not there , But here upon the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 31]: `` So let us strive , while life remains , To save all souls on board , And then if die at last we must , Let . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 8]: I can not speak the word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 30]: Said Dollinger the pilot man , Tow ` ring above the crew , `` Fear not , but trust in Dollinger , And he will fetch you through . ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 4]: `` Low bridge !
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 4]: low bridge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 60]: all heads went down , The laboring bark sped on ; A mill we passed , we passed church , Hamlets , and fields of corn ; And all the world came out to see , And chased along the shore Crying , `` Alas , alas , the sheeted rain , The wind , the tempest 's roar !
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 15]: Alas , the gallant ship and crew , Can nothing help them more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 52]: And from our deck sad eyes looked out Across the stormy scene : The tossing wake of billows aft , The bending forests green , The chickens sheltered under carts In lee of barn the cows , The skurrying swine with straw in mouth , The wild spray from our bows !
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 4]: `` She balances !
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 3]: She wavers !
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 6]: Now let her go about !
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 21]: If she misses stays and broaches to , We 're all '' -- then with a shout , `` Huray !
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 2]: huray !
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 2]: Avast !
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 2]: belay !
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 5]: Take in more sail !
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 6]: Lord , what a gale !
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 14]: Ho , boy , haul taut on the hind mule 's tail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 3]: `` Ho !
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 3]: lighten ship !
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 2]: ho !
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 4]: man the pump !
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 9]: Ho , hostler , heave the lead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 4]: `` A quarter-three !
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 6]: -- 't is shoaling fast !
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 4]: Three feet large !
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 4]: -- t-h-r-e-e feet !
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 6]: -- Three feet scant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 13]: I cried in fright `` Oh , is there no retreat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 30]: Said Dollinger , the pilot man , As on the vessel flew , `` Fear not , but trust in Dollinger , And he will fetch you through . ''
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 30]: A panic struck the bravest hearts , The boldest cheek turned pale ; For plain to all , this shoaling said A leak had burst the ditch 's bed !
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 23]: And , straight as bolt from crossbow sped , Our ship swept on , with shoaling lead , Before the fearful gale !
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 5]: `` Sever the tow-line !
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 5]: Cripple the mules ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 3]: Too late !
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 5]: There comes a shock !
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 15]: Another length , and the fated craft Would have swum in the saving lock !
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 54]: Then gathered together the shipwrecked crew And took one last embrace , While sorrowful tears from despairing eyes Ran down each hopeless face ; And some did think of their little ones Whom they never more might see , And others of waiting wives at home , And mothers that grieved would be .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 47]: But of all the children of misery there On that poor sinking frame , But one spake words of hope and faith , And I worshipped as they came : Said Dollinger the pilot man , -- -LRB- O brave heart , strong and true ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 18]: -- `` Fear not , but trust in Dollinger , For he will fetch you through . ''
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 2]: Lo !
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 26]: scarce the words have passed his lips The dauntless prophet say ` th , When every soul about him seeth A wonder crown his faith !
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 47]: `` And count ye all , both great and small , As numbered with the dead : For mariner for forty year , On Erie , boy and man , I never yet saw such a storm , Or one ' t with it began ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 55]: So overboard a keg of nails And anvils three we threw , Likewise four bales of gunny-sacks , Two hundred pounds of glue , Two sacks of corn , four ditto wheat , A box of books , a cow , A violin , Lord Byron 's works , A rip-saw and a sow .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 3]: A curve !
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 3]: a curve !
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 4]: the dangers grow !
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 3]: `` Labbord !
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 3]: -- stabbord !
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 3]: -- s-t-e-a-d-y !
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 3]: -- so !
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 5]: -- Hard-a-port , Dol !
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 3]: -- hellum-a-lee !
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 5]: Haw the head mule !
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 6]: -- the aft one gee !
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 2]: Luff !
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 8]: -- bring her to the wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 26]: For straight a farmer brought a plank , -- -LRB- Mysteriously inspired -RRB- -- And laying it unto the ship , In silent awe retired .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 14]: Then every sufferer stood amazed That pilot man before ; A moment stood .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 9]: Then wondering turned , And speechless walked ashore .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 3]: CHAPTER LII .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 34]: Since I desire , in this chapter , to say an instructive word or two about the silver mines , the reader may take this fair warning and skip , if he chooses .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 18]: The year 1863 was perhaps the very top blossom and culmination of the `` flush times . ''
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 40]: Virginia swarmed with men and vehicles to that degree that the place looked like a very hive -- that is when one 's vision could pierce through the thick fog of alkali dust that was generally blowing in summer .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 63]: I will say , concerning this dust , that if you drove ten miles through it , you and your horses would be coated with it a sixteenth of an inch thick and present an outside appearance that was a uniform pale yellow color , and your buggy would have three inches of dust in it , thrown there by the wheels .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 46]: The delicate scales used by the assayers were inclosed in glass cases intended to be air-tight , and yet some of this dust was so impalpable and so invisibly fine that it would get in , somehow , and impair the accuracy of those scales .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 18]: Speculation ran riot , and yet there was a world of substantial business going on , too .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 57]: All freights were brought over the mountains from California -LRB- 150 miles -RRB- by pack-train partly , and partly in huge wagons drawn by such long mule teams that each team amounted to a procession , and it did seem , sometimes , that the grand combined procession of animals stretched unbroken from Virginia to California .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 22]: Its long route was traceable clear across the deserts of the Territory by the writhing serpent of dust it lifted up .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 40]: By these wagons , freights over that hundred and fifty miles were $ 200 a ton for small lots -LRB- same price for all express matter brought by stage -RRB- , and $ 100 a ton for full loads .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 20]: One Virginia firm received one hundred tons of freight a month , and paid $ 10,000 a month freightage .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 9]: In the winter the freights were much higher .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 66]: All the bullion was shipped in bars by stage to San Francisco -LRB- a bar was usually about twice the size of a pig of lead and contained from $ 1,500 to $ 3,000 according to the amount of gold mixed with the silver -RRB- , and the freight on it -LRB- when the shipment was large -RRB- was one and a quarter per cent .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 5]: of its intrinsic value .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 16]: So , the freight on these bars probably averaged something more than $ 25 each .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 7]: Small shippers paid two per cent .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 44]: There were three stages a day , each way , and I have seen the out-going stages carry away a third of a ton of bullion each , and more than once I saw them divide a two-ton lot and take it off .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 7]: However , these were extraordinary events .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 24]: -LSB- Mr. Valentine , Wells Fargo 's agent , has handled all the bullion shipped through the Virginia office for many a month .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 92]: To his memory -- which is excellent -- we are indebted for the following exhibit of the company 's business in the Virginia office since the first of January , 1862 : From January 1st to April 1st , about $ 270,000 worth of bullion passed through that office , during the next quarter , $ 570,000 ; next quarter , $ 800,000 ; next quarter , $ 956,000 ; next quarter , $ 1,275,000 ; and for the quarter ending on the 30th of last June , about $ 1,600,000 .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 18]: Thus in a year and a half , the Virginia office only shipped $ 5,330,000 in bullion .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 25]: During the year 1862 they shipped $ 2,615,000 , so we perceive the average shipments have more than doubled in the last six months .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 39]: This gives us room to promise for the Virginia office $ 500,000 a month for the year 1863 -LRB- though perhaps , judging by the steady increase in the business , we are under estimating , somewhat -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 9]: This gives us $ 6,000,000 for the year .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 17]: Gold Hill and Silver City together can beat us -- we will give them $ 10,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 38]: To Dayton , Empire City , Ophir and Carson City , we will allow an aggregate of $ 8,000,000 , which is not over the mark , perhaps , and may possibly be a little under it .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 7]: To Esmeralda we give $ 4,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 23]: To Reese River and Humboldt $ 2,000,000 , which is liberal now , but may not be before the year is out .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 16]: So we prognosticate that the yield of bullion this year will be about $ 30,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 29]: Placing the number of mills in the Territory at one hundred , this gives to each the labor of producing $ 300,000 in bullion during the twelve months .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 30]: Allowing them to run three hundred days in the year -LRB- which none of them more than do -RRB- , this makes their work average $ 1,000 a day .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 55]: Say the mills average twenty tons of rock a day and this rock worth $ 50 as a general thing , and you have the actual work of our one hundred mills figured down `` to a spot '' -- $ 1,000 a day each , and $ 30,000,000 a year in the aggregate .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 3]: -- Enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 33]: -LSB- A considerable over estimate -- M. T. -RSB- -RSB- Two tons of silver bullion would be in the neighborhood of forty bars , and the freight on it over $ 1,000 .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 29]: Each coach always carried a deal of ordinary express matter beside , and also from fifteen to twenty passengers at from $ 25 to $ 30 a head .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 22]: With six stages going all the time , Wells , Fargo and Co. 's Virginia City business was important and lucrative .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 53]: All along under the centre of Virginia and Gold Hill , for a couple of miles , ran the great Comstock silver lode -- a vein of ore from fifty to eighty feet thick between its solid walls of rock -- a vein as wide as some of New York 's streets .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 19]: I will remind the reader that in Pennsylvania a coal vein only eight feet wide is considered ample .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 12]: Virginia was a busy city of streets and houses above ground .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 66]: Under it was another busy city , down in the bowels of the earth , where a great population of men thronged in and out among an intricate maze of tunnels and drifts , flitting hither and thither under a winking sparkle of lights , and over their heads towered a vast web of interlocking timbers that held the walls of the gutted Comstock apart .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 31]: These timbers were as large as a man 's body , and the framework stretched upward so far that no eye could pierce to its top through the closing gloom .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 16]: It was like peering up through the clean-picked ribs and bones of some colossal skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 21]: Imagine such a framework two miles long , sixty feet wide , and higher than any church spire in America .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 45]: Imagine this stately lattice-work stretching down Broadway , from the St. Nicholas to Wall street , and a Fourth of July procession , reduced to pigmies , parading on top of it and flaunting their flags , high above the pinnacle of Trinity steeple .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 60]: One can imagine that , but he can not well imagine what that forest of timbers cost , from the time they were felled in the pineries beyond Washoe Lake , hauled up and around Mount Davidson at atrocious rates of freightage , then squared , let down into the deep maw of the mine and built up there .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 15]: Twenty ample fortunes would not timber one of the greatest of those silver mines .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 22]: The Spanish proverb says it requires a gold mine to `` run '' a silver one , and it is true .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 17]: A beggar with a silver mine is a pitiable pauper indeed if he can not sell .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 10]: I spoke of the underground Virginia as a city .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 45]: The Gould and Curry is only one single mine under there , among a great many others ; yet the Gould and Curry 's streets of dismal drifts and tunnels were five miles in extent , altogether , and its population five hundred miners .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 23]: Taken as a whole , the underground city had some thirty miles of streets and a population of five or six thousand .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 49]: In this present day some of those populations are at work from twelve to sixteen hundred feet under Virginia and Gold Hill , and the signal-bells that tell them what the superintendent above ground desires them to do are struck by telegraph as we strike a fire alarm .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 14]: Sometimes men fall down a shaft , there , a thousand feet deep .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 13]: In such cases , the usual plan is to hold an inquest .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 47]: If you wish to visit one of those mines , you may walk through a tunnel about half a mile long if you prefer it , or you may take the quicker plan of shooting like a dart down a shaft , on a small platform .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 13]: It is like tumbling down through an empty steeple , feet first .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 152]: When you reach the bottom , you take a candle and tramp through drifts and tunnels where throngs of men are digging and blasting ; you watch them send up tubs full of great lumps of stone -- silver ore ; you select choice specimens from the mass , as souvenirs ; you admire the world of skeleton timbering ; you reflect frequently that you are buried under a mountain , a thousand feet below daylight ; being in the bottom of the mine you climb from `` gallery '' to `` gallery , '' up endless ladders that stand straight up and down ; when your legs fail you at last , you lie down in a small box-car in a cramped `` incline '' like a half-up-ended sewer and are dragged up to daylight feeling as if you are crawling through a coffin that has no end to it .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 76]: Arrived at the top , you find a busy crowd of men receiving the ascending cars and tubs and dumping the ore from an elevation into long rows of bins capable of holding half a dozen tons each ; under the bins are rows of wagons loading from chutes and trap-doors in the bins , and down the long street is a procession of these wagons wending toward the silver mills with their rich freight .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 14]: It is all `` done , '' now , and there you are .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 14]: You need never go down again , for you have seen it all .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 35]: If you have forgotten the process of reducing the ore in the mill and making the silver bars , you can go back and find it again in my Esmeralda chapters if so disposed .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 43]: Of course these mines cave in , in places , occasionally , and then it is worth one 's while to take the risk of descending into them and observing the crushing power exerted by the pressing weight of a settling mountain .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 27]: I published such an experience in the Enterprise , once , and from it I will take an extract : AN HOUR IN THE CAVED MINES .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 16]: -- We journeyed down into the Ophir mine , yesterday , to see the earthquake .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 20]: We could not go down the deep incline , because it still has a propensity to cave in places .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 38]: Therefore we traveled through the long tunnel which enters the hill above the Ophir office , and then by means of a series of long ladders , climbed away down from the first to the fourth gallery .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 24]: Traversing a drift , we came to the Spanish line , passed five sets of timbers still uninjured , and found the earthquake .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 38]: Here was as complete a chaos as ever was seen -- vast masses of earth and splintered and broken timbers piled confusedly together , with scarcely an aperture left large enough for a cat to creep through .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 46]: Rubbish was still falling at intervals from above , and one timber which had braced others earlier in the day , was now crushed down out of its former position , showing that the caving and settling of the tremendous mass was still going on .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 16]: We were in that portion of the Ophir known as the `` north mines . ''
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 24]: Returning to the surface , we entered a tunnel leading into the Central , for the purpose of getting into the main Ophir .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 34]: Descending a long incline in this tunnel , we traversed a drift or so , and then went down a deep shaft from whence we proceeded into the fifth gallery of the Ophir .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 32]: From a side-drift we crawled through a small hole and got into the midst of the earthquake again -- earth and broken timbers mingled together without regard to grace or symmetry .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 30]: A large portion of the second , third and fourth galleries had caved in and gone to destruction -- the two latter at seven o'clock on the previous evening .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 42]: At the turn-table , near the northern extremity of the fifth gallery , two big piles of rubbish had forced their way through from the fifth gallery , and from the looks of the timbers , more was about to come .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 52]: These beams are solid -- eighteen inches square ; first , a great beam is laid on the floor , then upright ones , five feet high , stand on it , supporting another horizontal beam , and so on , square above square , like the framework of a window .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 39]: The superincumbent weight was sufficient to mash the ends of those great upright beams fairly into the solid wood of the horizontal ones three inches , compressing and bending the upright beam till it curved like a bow .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 25]: Before the Spanish caved in , some of their twelve-inch horizontal timbers were compressed in this way until they were only five inches thick !
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 16]: Imagine the power it must take to squeeze a solid log together in that way .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 36]: Here , also , was a range of timbers , for a distance of twenty feet , tilted six inches out of the perpendicular by the weight resting upon them from the caved galleries above .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 29]: You could hear things cracking and giving way , and it was not pleasant to know that the world overhead was slowly and silently sinking down upon you .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 13]: The men down in the mine do not mind it , however .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 39]: Returning along the fifth gallery , we struck the safe part of the Ophir incline , and went down it to the sixth ; but we found ten inches of water there , and had to come back .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 30]: In repairing the damage done to the incline , the pump had to be stopped for two hours , and in the meantime the water gained about a foot .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 15]: However , the pump was at work again , and the flood-water was decreasing .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 54]: We climbed up to the fifth gallery again and sought a deep shaft , whereby we might descend to another part of the sixth , out of reach of the water , but suffered disappointment , as the men had gone to dinner , and there was no one to man the windlass .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 35]: So , having seen the earthquake , we climbed out at the Union incline and tunnel , and adjourned , all dripping with candle grease and perspiration , to lunch at the Ophir office .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 48]: During the great flush year of 1863 , Nevada -LSB- claims to have -RSB- produced $ 25,000,000 in bullion -- almost , if not quite , a round million to each thousand inhabitants , which is very well , considering that she was without agriculture and manufactures .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 8]: Silver mining was her sole productive industry .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 35]: -LSB- Since the above was in type , I learn from an official source that the above figure is too high , and that the yield for 1863 did not exceed $ 20,000,000 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 62]: However , the day for large figures is approaching ; the Sutro Tunnel is to plow through the Comstock lode from end to end , at a depth of two thousand feet , and then mining will be easy and comparatively inexpensive ; and the momentous matters of drainage , and hoisting and hauling of ore will cease to be burdensome .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 42]: This vast work will absorb many years , and millions of dollars , in its completion ; but it will early yield money , for that desirable epoch will begin as soon as it strikes the first end of the vein .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 15]: The tunnel will be some eight miles long , and will develop astonishing riches .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 32]: Cars will carry the ore through the tunnel and dump it in the mills and thus do away with the present costly system of double handling and transportation by mule teams .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 14]: The water from the tunnel will furnish the motive power for the mills .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 40]: Mr. Sutro , the originator of this prodigious enterprise , is one of the few men in the world who is gifted with the pluck and perseverance necessary to follow up and hound such an undertaking to its completion .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 39]: He has converted several obstinate Congresses to a deserved friendliness toward his important work , and has gone up and down and to and fro in Europe until he has enlisted a great moneyed interest in it there .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIII .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 60]: Every now and then , in these days , the boys used to tell me I ought to get one Jim Blaine to tell me the stirring story of his grandfather 's old ram -- but they always added that I must not mention the matter unless Jim was drunk at the time -- just comfortably and sociably drunk .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 16]: They kept this up until my curiosity was on the rack to hear the story .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 31]: I got to haunting Blaine ; but it was of no use , the boys always found fault with his condition ; he was often moderately but never satisfactorily drunk .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 28]: I never watched a man 's condition with such absorbing interest , such anxious solicitude ; I never so pined to see a man uncompromisingly drunk before .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 63]: At last , one evening I hurried to his cabin , for I learned that this time his situation was such that even the most fastidious could find no fault with it -- he was tranquilly , serenely , symmetrically drunk -- not a hiccup to mar his voice , not a cloud upon his brain thick enough to obscure his memory .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 27]: As I entered , he was sitting upon an empty powder-keg , with a clay pipe in one hand and the other raised to command silence .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 34]: His face was round , red , and very serious ; his throat was bare and his hair tumbled ; in general appearance and costume he was a stalwart miner of the period .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 30]: On the pine table stood a candle , and its dim light revealed `` the boys '' sitting here and there on bunks , candle-boxes , powder-kegs , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 7]: They said : `` Sh -- !
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 11]: Do n't speak -- he 's going to commence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 7]: THE STORY OF THE OLD RAM .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 23]: I found a seat at once , and Blaine said : ' I do n't reckon them times will ever come again .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 13]: There never was a more bullier old ram than what he was .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 80]: Grandfather fetched him from Illinois -- got him of a man by the name of Yates -- Bill Yates -- maybe you might have heard of him ; his father was a deacon -- Baptist -- and he was a rustler , too ; a man had to get up ruther early to get the start of old Thankful Yates ; it was him that put the Greens up to jining teams with my grandfather when he moved west .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 46]: ` Seth Green was prob ` ly the pick of the flock ; he married a Wilkerson -- Sarah Wilkerson -- good cretur , she was -- one of the likeliest heifers that was ever raised in old Stoddard , everybody said that knowed her .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 18]: She could heft a bar ' l of flour as easy as I can flirt a flapjack .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 3]: And spin ?
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 5]: Do n't mention it !
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 2]: Independent ?
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 2]: Humph !
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 28]: When Sile Hawkins come a browsing around her , she let him know that for all his tin he could n't trot in harness alongside of her .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 88]: You see , Sile Hawkins was -- no , it war n't Sile Hawkins , after all -- it was a galoot by the name of Filkins -- I disremember his first name ; but he was a stump -- come into pra ' r meeting drunk , one night , hooraying for Nixon , becuz he thought it was a primary ; and old deacon Ferguson up and scooted him through the window and he lit on old Miss Jefferson 's head , poor old filly .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 84]: She was a good soul -- had a glass eye and used to lend it to old Miss Wagner , that had n't any , to receive company in ; it war n't big enough , and when Miss Wagner war n't noticing , it would get twisted around in the socket , and look up , maybe , or out to one side , and every which way , while t ' other one was looking as straight ahead as a spy-glass .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 24]: ` Grown people did n't mind it , but it most always made the children cry , it was so sort of scary .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 40]: She tried packing it in raw cotton , but it would n't work , somehow -- the cotton would get loose and stick out and look so kind of awful that the children could n't stand it no way .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 42]: She was always dropping it out , and turning up her old dead-light on the company empty , and making them oncomfortable , becuz she never could tell when it hopped out , being blind on that side , you see .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 18]: So somebody would have to hunch her and say , `` Your game eye has fetched loose .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 51]: Miss Wagner dear '' -- and then all of them would have to sit and wait till she jammed it in again -- wrong side before , as a general thing , and green as a bird 's egg , being a bashful cretur and easy sot back before company .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 41]: But being wrong side before war n't much difference , anyway ; becuz her own eye was sky-blue and the glass one was yaller on the front side , so whichever way she turned it it did n't match nohow .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 13]: ` Old Miss Wagner was considerable on the borrow , she was .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 42]: When she had a quilting , or Dorcas S'iety at her house she gen ` ally borrowed Miss Higgins 's wooden leg to stump around on ; it was considerable shorter than her other pin , but much she minded that .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 39]: She said she could n't abide crutches when she had company , becuz they were so slow ; said when she had company and things had to be done , she wanted to get up and hump herself .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 105]: She was as bald as a jug , and so she used to borrow Miss Jacops 's wig -- Miss Jacops was the coffin-peddler 's wife -- a ratty old buzzard , he was , that used to go roosting around where people was sick , waiting for 'em ; and there that old rip would sit all day , in the shade , on a coffin that he judged would fit the can ` idate ; and if it was a slow customer and kind of uncertain , he 'd fetch his rations and a blanket along and sleep in the coffin nights .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 59]: He was anchored out that way , in frosty weather , for about three weeks , once , before old Robbins 's place , waiting for him ; and after that , for as much as two years , Jacops was not on speaking terms with the old man , on account of his disapp ` inting him .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 25]: He got one of his feet froze , and lost money , too , becuz old Robbins took a favorable turn and got well .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 80]: The next time Robbins got sick , Jacops tried to make up with him , and varnished up the same old coffin and fetched it along ; but old Robbins was too many for him ; he had him in , and ` peared to be powerful weak ; he bought the coffin for ten dollars and Jacops was to pay it back and twenty-five more besides if Robbins did n't like the coffin after he 'd tried it .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 42]: And then Robbins died , and at the funeral he bursted off the lid and riz up in his shroud and told the parson to let up on the performances , becuz he could not stand such a coffin as that .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 52]: You see he had been in a trance once before , when he was young , and he took the chances on another , cal ` lating that if he made the trip it was money in his pocket , and if he missed fire he could n't lose a cent .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 35]: And by George he sued Jacops for the rhino and got jedgment ; and he set up the coffin in his back parlor and said he ` lowed to take his time , now .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 16]: It was always an aggravation to Jacops , the way that miserable old thing acted .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 21]: He moved back to Indiany pretty soon -- went to Wellsville -- Wellsville was the place the Hogadorns was from .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 4]: Mighty fine family .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 4]: Old Maryland stock .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 21]: Old Squire Hogadorn could carry around more mixed licker , and cuss better than most any man I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 23]: His second wife was the widder Billings -- she that was Becky Martin ; her dam was deacon Dunlap 's first wife .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 20]: Her oldest child , Maria , married a missionary and died in grace -- et up by the savages .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 12]: They et him , too , poor feller -- biled him .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 76]: It war n't the custom , so they say , but they explained to friends of his 'n that went down there to bring away his things , that they 'd tried missionaries every other way and never could get any good out of 'em -- and so it annoyed all his relations to find out that that man 's life was fooled away just out of a dern 'd experiment , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 53]: But mind you , there ai n't anything ever reely lost ; everything that people ca n't understand and do n't see the reason of does good if you only hold on and give it a fair shake ; Prov ` dence do n't fire no blank ca ` tridges , boys .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 28]: That there missionary 's substance , unbeknowns to himself , actu ` ly converted every last one of them heathens that took a chance at the barbacue .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 7]: Nothing ever fetched them but that .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 13]: Do n't tell me it was an accident that he was biled .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 11]: There ai n't no such a thing as an accident .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 48]: ` When my uncle Lem was leaning up agin a scaffolding once , sick , or drunk , or suthin , an Irishman with a hod full of bricks fell on him out of the third story and broke the old man 's back in two places .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 7]: People said it was an accident .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 7]: Much accident there was about that .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 19]: He did n't know what he was there for , but he was there for a good object .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 13]: If he had n't been there the Irishman would have been killed .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 11]: Nobody can ever make me believe anything different from that .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 7]: Uncle Lem 's dog was there .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 10]: Why did n't the Irishman fall on the dog ?
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 14]: Becuz the dog would a seen him a coming and stood from under .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 10]: That 's the reason the dog war n't appinted .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 14]: A dog ca n't be depended on to carry out a special providence .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 9]: Mark my words it was a put-up thing .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 7]: Accidents do n't happen , boys .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 14]: Uncle Lem 's dog -- I wish you could a seen that dog .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 29]: He was a reglar shepherd -- or ruther he was part bull and part shepherd -- splendid animal ; belonged to parson Hagar before Uncle Lem got him .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 81]: Parson Hagar belonged to the Western Reserve Hagars ; prime family ; his mother was a Watson ; one of his sisters married a Wheeler ; they settled in Morgan county , and he got nipped by the machinery in a carpet factory and went through in less than a quarter of a minute ; his widder bought the piece of carpet that had his remains wove in , and people come a hundred mile to ` tend the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 8]: There was fourteen yards in the piece .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 19]: ` She would n't let them roll him up , but planted him just so -- full length .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 27]: The church was middling small where they preached the funeral , and they had to let one end of the coffin stick out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 22]: They did n't bury him -- they planted one end , and let him stand up , same as a monument .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 83]: And they nailed a sign on it and put -- put on -- put on it -- sacred to -- the m-e-m-o-r-y -- of fourteen y-a-r-d-s -- of three-ply -- car -- pet -- containing all that was -- m-o-r-t-a-l -- of -- of -- W-i-l-l-i-a-m -- W-h-e -- ' Jim Blaine had been growing gradually drowsy and drowsier -- his head nodded , once , twice , three times -- dropped peacefully upon his breast , and he fell tranquilly asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 31]: The tears were running down the boys ' cheeks -- they were suffocating with suppressed laughter -- and had been from the start , though I had never noticed it .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 9]: I perceived that I was `` sold . ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 76]: I learned then that Jim Blaine 's peculiarity was that whenever he reached a certain stage of intoxication , no human power could keep him from setting out , with impressive unction , to tell about a wonderful adventure which he had once had with his grandfather 's old ram -- and the mention of the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had ever heard him get , concerning it .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 26]: He always maundered off , interminably , from one thing to another , till his whisky got the best of him and he fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 30]: What the thing was that happened to him and his grandfather 's old ram is a dark mystery to this day , for nobody has ever yet found out .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIV .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 25]: Of course there was a large Chinese population in Virginia -- it is the case with every town and city on the Pacific coast .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 43]: They are a harmless race when white men either let them alone or treat them no worse than dogs ; in fact they are almost entirely harmless anyhow , for they seldom think of resenting the vilest insults or the cruelest injuries .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 23]: They are quiet , peaceable , tractable , free from drunkenness , and they are as industrious as the day is long .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 14]: A disorderly Chinaman is rare , and a lazy one does not exist .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 44]: So long as a Chinaman has strength to use his hands he needs no support from anybody ; white men often complain of want of work , but a Chinaman offers no such complaint ; he always manages to find something to do .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 44]: He is a great convenience to everybody -- even to the worst class of white men , for he bears the most of their sins , suffering fines for their petty thefts , imprisonment for their robberies , and death for their murders .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 24]: Any white man can swear a Chinaman 's life away in the courts , but no Chinaman can testify against a white man .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 18]: Ours is the `` land of the free '' -- nobody denies that -- nobody challenges it .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 14]: -LSB- Maybe it is because we wo n't let other people testify . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 39]: As I write , news comes that in broad daylight in San Francisco , some boys have stoned an inoffensive Chinaman to death , and that although a large crowd witnessed the shameful deed , no one interfered .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 17]: There are seventy thousand -LRB- and possibly one hundred thousand -RRB- Chinamen on the Pacific coast .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 8]: There were about a thousand in Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 28]: They were penned into a `` Chinese quarter '' -- a thing which they do not particularly object to , as they are fond of herding together .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 28]: Their buildings were of wood ; usually only one story high , and set thickly together along streets scarcely wide enough for a wagon to pass through .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 13]: Their quarter was a little removed from the rest of the town .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 12]: The chief employment of Chinamen in towns is to wash clothing .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 15]: They always send a bill , like this below , pinned to the clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 14]: It is mere ceremony , for it does not enlighten the customer much .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 24]: Their price for washing was $ 2.50 per dozen -- rather cheaper than white people could afford to wash for at that time .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 36]: A very common sign on the Chinese houses was : `` See Yup , Washer and Ironer '' ; `` Hong Wo , Washer '' ; `` Sam Sing & Ah Hop , Washing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 17]: The house servants , cooks , etc. , in California and Nevada , were chiefly Chinamen .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 11]: There were few white servants and no Chinawomen so employed .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 20]: Chinamen make good house servants , being quick , obedient , patient , quick to learn and tirelessly industrious .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 16]: They do not need to be taught a thing twice , as a general thing .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 4]: They are imitative .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 40]: If a Chinaman were to see his master break up a centre table , in a passion , and kindle a fire with it , that Chinaman would be likely to resort to the furniture for fuel forever afterward .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 20]: All Chinamen can read , write and cipher with easy facility -- pity but all our petted voters could .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 15]: In California they rent little patches of ground and do a deal of gardening .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 12]: They will raise surprising crops of vegetables on a sand pile .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 4]: They waste nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 20]: What is rubbish to a Christian , a Chinaman carefully preserves and makes useful in one way or another .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 27]: He gathers up all the old oyster and sardine cans that white people throw away , and procures marketable tin and solder from them by melting .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 11]: He gathers up old bones and turns them into manure .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 65]: In California he gets a living out of old mining claims that white men have abandoned as exhausted and worthless -- and then the officers come down on him once a month with an exorbitant swindle to which the legislature has given the broad , general name of `` foreign '' mining tax , but it is usually inflicted on no foreigners but Chinamen .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 36]: This swindle has in some cases been repeated once or twice on the same victim in the course of the same month -- but the public treasury was no additionally enriched by it , probably .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 17]: Chinamen hold their dead in great reverence -- they worship their departed ancestors , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 43]: Hence , in China , a man 's front yard , back yard , or any other part of his premises , is made his family burying ground , in order that he may visit the graves at any and all times .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 70]: Therefore that huge empire is one mighty cemetery ; it is ridged and wringled from its centre to its circumference with graves -- and inasmuch as every foot of ground must be made to do its utmost , in China , lest the swarming population suffer for food , the very graves are cultivated and yield a harvest , custom holding this to be no dishonor to the dead .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 26]: Since the departed are held in such worshipful reverence , a Chinaman can not bear that any indignity be offered the places where they sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 33]: Mr. Burlingame said that herein lay China 's bitter opposition to railroads ; a road could not be built anywhere in the empire without disturbing the graves of their ancestors or friends .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 43]: A Chinaman hardly believes he could enjoy the hereafter except his body lay in his beloved China ; also , he desires to receive , himself , after death , that worship with which he has honored his dead that preceded him .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 92]: Therefore , if he visits a foreign country , he makes arrangements to have his bones returned to China in case he dies ; if he hires to go to a foreign country on a labor contract , there is always a stipulation that his body shall be taken back to China if he dies ; if the government sells a gang of Coolies to a foreigner for the usual five-year term , it is specified in the contract that their bodies shall be restored to China in case of death .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 41]: On the Pacific coast the Chinamen all belong to one or another of several great companies or organizations , and these companies keep track of their members , register their names , and ship their bodies home when they die .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 13]: The See Yup Company is held to be the largest of these .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 16]: The Ning Yeong Company is next , and numbers eighteen thousand members on the coast .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 41]: Its headquarters are at San Francisco , where it has a costly temple , several great officers -LRB- one of whom keeps regal state in seclusion and can not be approached by common humanity -RRB- , and a numerous priesthood .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 25]: In it I was shown a register of its members , with the dead and the date of their shipment to China duly marked .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 48]: Every ship that sails from San Francisco carries away a heavy freight of Chinese corpses -- or did , at least , until the legislature , with an ingenious refinement of Christian cruelty , forbade the shipments , as a neat underhanded way of deterring Chinese immigration .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 11]: The bill was offered , whether it passed or not .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 8]: It is my impression that it passed .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 43]: There was another bill -- it became a law -- compelling every incoming Chinaman to be vaccinated on the wharf and pay a duly appointed quack -LRB- no decent doctor would defile himself with such legalized robbery -RRB- ten dollars for it .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 28]: As few importers of Chinese would want to go to an expense like that , the law-makers thought this would be another heavy blow to Chinese immigration .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 47]: What the Chinese quarter of Virginia was like -- or , indeed , what the Chinese quarter of any Pacific coast town was and is like -- may be gathered from this item which I printed in the Enterprise while reporting for that paper : CHINATOWN .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 19]: -- Accompanied by a fellow reporter , we made a trip through our Chinese quarter the other night .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 42]: The Chinese have built their portion of the city to suit themselves ; and as they keep neither carriages nor wagons , their streets are not wide enough , as a general thing , to admit of the passage of vehicles .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 15]: At ten o'clock at night the Chinaman may be seen in all his glory .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 98]: In every little cooped-up , dingy cavern of a hut , faint with the odor of burning Josh-lights and with nothing to see the gloom by save the sickly , guttering tallow candle , were two or three yellow , long-tailed vagabonds , coiled up on a sort of short truckle-bed , smoking opium , motionless and with their lustreless eyes turned inward from excess of satisfaction -- or rather the recent smoker looks thus , immediately after having passed the pipe to his neighbor -- for opium-smoking is a comfortless operation , and requires constant attention .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 93]: A lamp sits on the bed , the length of the long pipe-stem from the smoker 's mouth ; he puts a pellet of opium on the end of a wire , sets it on fire , and plasters it into the pipe much as a Christian would fill a hole with putty ; then he applies the bowl to the lamp and proceeds to smoke -- and the stewing and frying of the drug and the gurgling of the juices in the stem would well-nigh turn the stomach of a statue .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 41]: John likes it , though ; it soothes him , he takes about two dozen whiffs , and then rolls over to dream , Heaven only knows what , for we could not imagine by looking at the soggy creature .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 30]: Possibly in his visions he travels far away from the gross world and his regular washing , and feast on succulent rats and birds ' - nests in Paradise .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 13]: Mr. Ah Sing keeps a general grocery and provision store at No .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 4]: 13 Wang street .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 12]: He lavished his hospitality upon our party in the friendliest way .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 38]: He had various kinds of colored and colorless wines and brandies , with unpronouncable names , imported from China in little crockery jugs , and which he offered to us in dainty little miniature wash-basins of porcelain .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 50]: He offered us a mess of birds ' - nests ; also , small , neat sausages , of which we could have swallowed several yards if we had chosen to try , but we suspected that each link contained the corpse of a mouse , and therefore refrained .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 30]: Mr. Sing had in his store a thousand articles of merchandise , curious to behold , impossible to imagine the uses of , and beyond our ability to describe .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 54]: His ducks , however , and his eggs , we could understand ; the former were split open and flattened out like codfish , and came from China in that shape , and the latter were plastered over with some kind of paste which kept them fresh and palatable through the long voyage .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 57]: We found Mr. Hong Wo , No. 37 Chow-chow street , making up a lottery scheme -- in fact we found a dozen others occupied in the same way in various parts of the quarter , for about every third Chinaman runs a lottery , and the balance of the tribe `` buck '' at it .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 78]: `` Tom , '' who speaks faultless English , and used to be chief and only cook to the Territorial Enterprise , when the establishment kept bachelor 's hall two years ago , said that `` Sometime Chinaman buy ticket one dollar hap , ketch um two tree hundred , sometime no ketch um anything ; lottery like one man fight um seventy -- may-be he whip , may-be he get whip heself , welly good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 26]: However , the percentage being sixty-nine against him , the chances are , as a general thing , that `` he get whip heself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 50]: We could not see that these lotteries differed in any respect from our own , save that the figures being Chinese , no ignorant white man might ever hope to succeed in telling `` t ` other from which ; '' the manner of drawing is similar to ours .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 12]: Mr. See Yup keeps a fancy store on Live Fox street .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 44]: He sold us fans of white feathers , gorgeously ornamented ; perfumery that smelled like Limburger cheese , Chinese pens , and watch-charms made of a stone unscratchable with steel instruments , yet polished and tinted like the inner coat of a sea-shell .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 25]: As tokens of his esteem , See Yup presented the party with gaudy plumes made of gold tinsel and trimmed with peacocks ' feathers .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 46]: We ate chow-chow with chop-sticks in the celestial restaurants ; our comrade chided the moon-eyed damsels in front of the houses for their want of feminine reserve ; we received protecting Josh-lights from our hosts and `` dickered '' for a pagan God or two .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 43]: Finally , we were impressed with the genius of a Chinese book-keeper ; he figured up his accounts on a machine like a gridiron with buttons strung on its bars ; the different rows represented units , tens , hundreds and thousands .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 33]: He fingered them with incredible rapidity -- in fact , he pushed them from place to place as fast as a musical professor 's fingers travel over the keys of a piano .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 26]: They are a kindly disposed , well-meaning race , and are respected and well treated by the upper classes , all over the Pacific coast .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 28]: No Californian gentleman or lady ever abuses or oppresses a Chinaman , under any circumstances , an explanation that seems to be much needed in the East .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 49]: Only the scum of the population do it -- they and their children ; they , and , naturally and consistently , the policemen and politicians , likewise , for these are the dust-licking pimps and slaves of the scum , there as well as elsewhere in America .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 3]: CHAPTER LV .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 13]: I began to get tired of staying in one place so long .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 90]: There was no longer satisfying variety in going down to Carson to report the proceedings of the legislature once a year , and horse-races and pumpkin-shows once in three months ; -LRB- they had got to raising pumpkins and potatoes in Washoe Valley , and of course one of the first achievements of the legislature was to institute a ten-thousand-dollar Agricultural Fair to show off forty dollars ' worth of those pumpkins in -- however , the territorial legislature was usually spoken of as the `` asylum '' -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 7]: I wanted to see San Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 6]: I wanted to go somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 11]: I wanted -- I did not know what I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 17]: I had the `` spring fever '' and wanted a change , principally , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 123]: Besides , a convention had framed a State Constitution ; nine men out of every ten wanted an office ; I believed that these gentlemen would `` treat '' the moneyless and the irresponsible among the population into adopting the constitution and thus well-nigh killing the country -LRB- it could not well carry such a load as a State government , since it had nothing to tax that could stand a tax , for undeveloped mines could not , and there were not fifty developed ones in the land , there was but little realty to tax , and it did seem as if nobody was ever going to think of the simple salvation of inflicting a money penalty on murder -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 21]: I believed that a State government would destroy the `` flush times , '' and I wanted to get away .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 49]: I believed that the mining stocks I had on hand would soon be worth $ 100,000 , and thought if they reached that before the Constitution was adopted , I would sell out and make myself secure from the crash the change of government was going to bring .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 29]: I considered $ 100,000 sufficient to go home with decently , though it was but a small amount compared to what I had been expecting to return with .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 28]: I felt rather down-hearted about it , but I tried to comfort myself with the reflection that with such a sum I could not fall into want .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 30]: About this time a schoolmate of mine whom I had not seen since boyhood , came tramping in on foot from Reese River , a very allegory of Poverty .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 59]: The son of wealthy parents , here he was , in a strange land , hungry , bootless , mantled in an ancient horse-blanket , roofed with a brimless hat , and so generally and so extravagantly dilapidated that he could have `` taken the shine out of the Prodigal Son himself , '' as he pleasantly remarked .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 34]: He wanted to borrow forty-six dollars -- twenty-six to take him to San Francisco , and twenty for something else ; to buy some soap with , maybe , for he needed it .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 65]: I found I had but little more than the amount wanted , in my pocket ; so I stepped in and borrowed forty-six dollars of a banker -LRB- on twenty days ' time , without the formality of a note -RRB- , and gave it him , rather than walk half a block to the office , where I had some specie laid up .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 44]: If anybody had told me that it would take me two years to pay back that forty-six dollars to the banker -LRB- for I did not expect it of the Prodigal , and was not disappointed -RRB- , I would have felt injured .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 6]: And so would the banker .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 5]: I wanted a change .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 7]: I wanted variety of some kind .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 3]: It came .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 16]: Mr. Goodman went away for a week and left me the post of chief editor .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 4]: It destroyed me .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 14]: The first day , I wrote my `` leader '' in the forenoon .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 16]: The second day , I had no subject and put it off till the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 36]: The third day I put it off till evening , and then copied an elaborate editorial out of the `` American Cyclopedia , '' that steadfast friend of the editor , all over this land .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 20]: The fourth day I `` fooled around '' till midnight , and then fell back on the Cyclopedia again .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 27]: The fifth day I cudgeled my brain till midnight , and then kept the press waiting while I penned some bitter personalities on six different people .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 18]: The sixth day I labored in anguish till far into the night and brought forth -- nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 9]: The paper went to press without an editorial .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 6]: The seventh day I resigned .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 21]: On the eighth , Mr. Goodman returned and found six duels on his hands -- my personalities had borne fruit .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 17]: Nobody , except he has tried it , knows what it is to be an editor .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 46]: It is easy to scribble local rubbish , with the facts all before you ; it is easy to clip selections from other papers ; it is easy to string out a correspondence from any locality ; but it is unspeakable hardship to write editorials .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 14]: Subjects are the trouble -- the dreary lack of them , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 35]: Every day , it is drag , drag , drag -- think , and worry and suffer -- all the world is a dull blank , and yet the editorial columns must be filled .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 48]: Only give the editor a subject , and his work is done -- it is no trouble to write it up ; but fancy how you would feel if you had to pump your brains dry every day in the week , fifty-two weeks in the year .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 11]: It makes one low spirited simply to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 30]: The matter that each editor of a daily paper in America writes in the course of a year would fill from four to eight bulky volumes like this book !
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 19]: Fancy what a library an editor 's work would make , after twenty or thirty years ' service .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 24]: Yet people often marvel that Dickens , Scott , Bulwer , Dumas , etc. , have been able to produce so many books .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 23]: If these authors had wrought as voluminously as newspaper editors do , the result would be something to marvel at , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 45]: How editors can continue this tremendous labor , this exhausting consumption of brain fibre -LRB- for their work is creative , and not a mere mechanical laying-up of facts , like reporting -RRB- , day after day and year after year , is incomprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 27]: Preachers take two months ' holiday in midsummer , for they find that to produce two sermons a week is wearing , in the long run .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 52]: In truth it must be so , and is so ; and therefore , how an editor can take from ten to twenty texts and build upon them from ten to twenty painstaking editorials a week and keep it up all the year round , is farther beyond comprehension than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 47]: Ever since I survived my week as editor , I have found at least one pleasure in any newspaper that comes to my hand ; it is in admiring the long columns of editorial , and wondering to myself how in the mischief he did it !
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 18]: Mr. Goodman 's return relieved me of employment , unless I chose to become a reporter again .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 20]: I could not do that ; I could not serve in the ranks after being General of the army .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 14]: So I thought I would depart and go abroad into the world somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 58]: Just at this juncture , Dan , my associate in the reportorial department , told me , casually , that two citizens had been trying to persuade him to go with them to New York and aid in selling a rich silver mine which they had discovered and secured in a new mining district in our neighborhood .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 20]: He said they offered to pay his expenses and give him one third of the proceeds of the sale .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 6]: He had refused to go .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 8]: It was the very opportunity I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 16]: I abused him for keeping so quiet about it , and not mentioning it sooner .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 33]: He said it had not occurred to him that I would like to go , and so he had recommended them to apply to Marshall , the reporter of the other paper .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 16]: I asked Dan if it was a good , honest mine , and no swindle .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 64]: He said the men had shown him nine tons of the rock , which they had got out to take to New York , and he could cheerfully say that he had seen but little rock in Nevada that was richer ; and moreover , he said that they had secured a tract of valuable timber and a mill-site , near the mine .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 8]: My first idea was to kill Dan .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 23]: But I changed my mind , notwithstanding I was so angry , for I thought maybe the chance was not yet lost .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 91]: Dan said it was by no means lost ; that the men were absent at the mine again , and would not be in Virginia to leave for the East for some ten days ; that they had requested him to do the talking to Marshall , and he had promised that he would either secure Marshall or somebody else for them by the time they got back ; he would now say nothing to anybody till they returned , and then fulfil his promise by furnishing me to them .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 4]: It was splendid .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 32]: I went to bed all on fire with excitement ; for nobody had yet gone East to sell a Nevada silver mine , and the field was white for the sickle .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 28]: I felt that such a mine as the one described by Dan would bring a princely sum in New York , and sell without delay or difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 16]: I could not sleep , my fancy so rioted through its castles in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 10]: It was the `` blind lead '' come again .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 68]: Next day I got away , on the coach , with the usual eclat attending departures of old citizens , -- for if you have only half a dozen friends out there they will make noise for a hundred rather than let you seem to go away neglected and unregretted -- and Dan promised to keep strict watch for the men that had the mine to sell .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 21]: The trip was signalized but by one little incident , and that occurred just as we were about to start .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 26]: A very seedy looking vagabond passenger got out of the stage a moment to wait till the usual ballast of silver bricks was thrown in .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 32]: He was standing on the pavement , when an awkward express employee , carrying a brick weighing a hundred pounds , stumbled and let it fall on the bummer 's foot .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 16]: He instantly dropped on the ground and began to howl in the most heart-breaking way .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 38]: A sympathizing crowd gathered around and were going to pull his boot off ; but he screamed louder than ever and they desisted ; then he fell to gasping , and between the gasps ejaculated `` Brandy !
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 8]: for Heaven 's sake , brandy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 16]: They poured half a pint down him , and it wonderfully restored and comforted him .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 16]: Then he begged the people to assist him to the stage , which was done .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 51]: The express people urged him to have a doctor at their expense , but he declined , and said that if he only had a little brandy to take along with him , to soothe his paroxyms of pain when they came on , he would be grateful and content .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 13]: He was quickly supplied with two bottles , and we drove off .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 29]: He was so smiling and happy after that , that I could not refrain from asking him how he could possibly be so comfortable with a crushed foot .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 27]: `` Well , '' said he , `` I had n't had a drink for twelve hours , and had n't a cent to my name .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 23]: I was most perishing -- and so , when that duffer dropped that hundred-pounder on my foot , I see my chance .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 9]: Got a cork leg , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 10]: and he pulled up his pantaloons and proved it .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 20]: He was as drunk as a lord all day long , and full of chucklings over his timely ingenuity .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 9]: One drunken man necessarily reminds one of another .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 17]: I once heard a gentleman tell about an incident which he witnessed in a Californian bar-room .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 12]: He entitled it `` Ye Modest Man Taketh a Drink . ''
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 24]: It was nothing but a bit of acting , but it seemed to me a perfect rendering , and worthy of Toodles himself .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 150]: The modest man , tolerably far gone with beer and other matters , enters a saloon -LRB- twenty-five cents is the price for anything and everything , and specie the only money used -RRB- and lays down a half dollar ; calls for whiskey and drinks it ; the bar-keeper makes change and lays the quarter in a wet place on the counter ; the modest man fumbles at it with nerveless fingers , but it slips and the water holds it ; he contemplates it , and tries again ; same result ; observes that people are interested in what he is at , blushes ; fumbles at the quarter again -- blushes -- puts his forefinger carefully , slowly down , to make sure of his aim -- pushes the coin toward the bar-keeper , and says with a sigh : `` Gim me a cigar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 11]: Naturally , another gentleman present told about another drunken man .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 36]: He said he reeled toward home late at night ; made a mistake and entered the wrong gate ; thought he saw a dog on the stoop ; and it was -- an iron one .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 24]: He stopped and considered ; wondered if it was a dangerous dog ; ventured to say `` Be -LRB- hic -RRB- begone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 3]: No effect .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 30]: Then he approached warily , and adopted conciliation ; pursed up his lips and tried to whistle , but failed ; still approached , saying , `` Poor dog !
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 7]: -- doggy , doggy , doggy !
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 5]: -- poor doggy-dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 28]: Got up on the stoop , still petting with fond names ; till master of the advantages ; then exclaimed , `` Leave , you thief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 17]: -- planted a vindictive kick in his ribs , and went head-over-heels overboard , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 24]: A pause ; a sigh or two of pain , and then a remark in a reflective voice : `` Awful solid dog .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 6]: What could he ben eating ?
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 5]: -LRB- ` ic ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 6]: Rocks , p ` raps .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 5]: Such animals is dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 12]: -- ' At 's what I say -- they 're dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 9]: If a man -- -LRB- ` ic ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 47]: -- if a man wants to feed a dog on rocks , let him feed him on rocks ; ` at 's all right ; but let him keep him at home -- not have him layin ' round promiscuous , where -LRB- ` ic ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 16]: where people 's liable to stumble over him when they ai n't noticin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 76]: It was not without regret that I took a last look at the tiny flag -LRB- it was thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide -RRB- fluttering like a lady 's handkerchief from the topmost peak of Mount Davidson , two thousand feet above Virginia 's roofs , and felt that doubtless I was bidding a permanent farewell to a city which had afforded me the most vigorous enjoyment of life I had ever experienced .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 31]: And this reminds me of an incident which the dullest memory Virginia could boast at the time it happened must vividly recall , at times , till its possessor dies .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 10]: Late one summer afternoon we had a rain shower .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 55]: That was astonishing enough , in itself , to set the whole town buzzing , for it only rains -LRB- during a week or two weeks -RRB- in the winter in Nevada , and even then not enough at a time to make it worth while for any merchant to keep umbrellas for sale .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 9]: But the rain was not the chief wonder .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 29]: It only lasted five or ten minutes ; while the people were still talking about it all the heavens gathered to themselves a dense blackness as of midnight .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 45]: All the vast eastern front of Mount Davidson , over-looking the city , put on such a funereal gloom that only the nearness and solidity of the mountain made its outlines even faintly distinguishable from the dead blackness of the heavens they rested against .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 41]: This unaccustomed sight turned all eyes toward the mountain ; and as they looked , a little tongue of rich golden flame was seen waving and quivering in the heart of the midnight , away up on the extreme summit !
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 30]: In a few minutes the streets were packed with people , gazing with hardly an uttered word , at the one brilliant mote in the brooding world of darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 26]: It flicked like a candle-flame , and looked no larger ; but with such a background it was wonderfully bright , small as it was .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 5]: It was the flag !
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 33]: -- though no one suspected it at first , it seemed so like a supernatural visitor of some kind -- a mysterious messenger of good tidings , some were fain to believe .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 42]: It was the nation 's emblem transfigured by the departing rays of a sun that was entirely palled from view ; and on no other object did the glory fall , in all the broad panorama of mountain ranges and deserts .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 33]: Not even upon the staff of the flag -- for that , a needle in the distance at any time , was now untouched by the light and undistinguishable in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 28]: For a whole hour the weird visitor winked and burned in its lofty solitude , and still the thousands of uplifted eyes watched it with fascinated interest .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 7]: How the people were wrought up !
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 70]: The superstition grew apace that this was a mystic courier come with great news from the war -- the poetry of the idea excusing and commending it -- and on it spread , from heart to heart , from lip to lip and from street to street , till there was a general impulse to have out the military and welcome the bright waif with a salvo of artillery !
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 75]: And all that time one sorely tried man , the telegraph operator sworn to official secrecy , had to lock his lips and chain his tongue with a silence that was like to rend them ; for he , and he only , of all the speculating multitude , knew the great things this sinking sun had seen that day in the east -- Vicksburg fallen , and the Union arms victorious at Gettysburg !
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 90]: But for the journalistic monopoly that forbade the slightest revealment of eastern news till a day after its publication in the California papers , the glorified flag on Mount Davidson would have been saluted and re-saluted , that memorable evening , as long as there was a charge of powder to thunder with ; the city would have been illuminated , and every man that had any respect for himself would have got drunk , -- as was the custom of the country on all occasions of public moment .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 18]: Even at this distant day I can not think of this needlessly marred supreme opportunity without regret .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 8]: What a time we might have had !
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVI .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 22]: We rumbled over the plains and valleys , climbed the Sierras to the clouds , and looked down upon summer-clad California .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 23]: And I will remark here , in passing , that all scenery in California requires distance to give it its highest charm .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 110]: The mountains are imposing in their sublimity and their majesty of form and altitude , from any point of view -- but one must have distance to soften their ruggedness and enrich their tintings ; a Californian forest is best at a little distance , for there is a sad poverty of variety in species , the trees being chiefly of one monotonous family -- redwood , pine , spruce , fir -- and so , at a near view there is a wearisome sameness of attitude in their rigid arms , stretched down ward and outward in one continued and reiterated appeal to all men to `` Sh !
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 7]: -- do n't say a word !
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 7]: -- you might disturb somebody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 109]: Close at hand , too , there is a reliefless and relentless smell of pitch and turpentine ; there is a ceaseless melancholy in their sighing and complaining foliage ; one walks over a soundless carpet of beaten yellow bark and dead spines of the foliage till he feels like a wandering spirit bereft of a footfall ; he tires of the endless tufts of needles and yearns for substantial , shapely leaves ; he looks for moss and grass to loll upon , and finds none , for where there is no bark there is naked clay and dirt , enemies to pensive musing and clean apparel .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 56]: Often a grassy plain in California , is what it should be , but often , too , it is best contemplated at a distance , because although its grass blades are tall , they stand up vindictively straight and self-sufficient , and are unsociably wide apart , with uncomely spots of barren sand between .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 30]: One of the queerest things I know of , is to hear tourists from `` the States '' go into ecstasies over the loveliness of `` ever-blooming California . ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 11]: And they always do go into that sort of ecstasies .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 77]: But perhaps they would modify them if they knew how old Californians , with the memory full upon them of the dust-covered and questionable summer greens of Californian `` verdure , '' stand astonished , and filled with worshipping admiration , in the presence of the lavish richness , the brilliant green , the infinite freshness , the spend-thrift variety of form and species and foliage that make an Eastern landscape a vision of Paradise itself .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 66]: The idea of a man falling into raptures over grave and sombre California , when that man has seen New England 's meadow-expanses and her maples , oaks and cathedral-windowed elms decked in summer attire , or the opaline splendors of autumn descending upon her forests , comes very near being funny -- would be , in fact , but that it is so pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 11]: No land with an unvarying climate can be very beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 15]: The tropics are not , for all the sentiment that is wasted on them .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 15]: They seem beautiful at first , but sameness impairs the charm by and by .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 12]: Change is the handmaiden Nature requires to do her miracles with .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 18]: The land that has four well-defined seasons , can not lack beauty , or pall with monotony .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 55]: Each season brings a world of enjoyment and interest in the watching of its unfolding , its gradual , harmonious development , its culminating graces -- and just as one begins to tire of it , it passes away and a radical change comes , with new witcheries and new glories in its train .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 22]: And I think that to one in sympathy with nature , each season , in its turn , seems the loveliest .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 58]: San Francisco , a truly fascinating city to live in , is stately and handsome at a fair distance , but close at hand one notes that the architecture is mostly old-fashioned , many streets are made up of decaying , smoke-grimed , wooden houses , and the barren sand-hills toward the outskirts obtrude themselves too prominently .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 40]: Even the kindly climate is sometimes pleasanter when read about than personally experienced , for a lovely , cloudless sky wears out its welcome by and by , and then when the longed for rain does come it stays .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 19]: Even the playful earthquake is better contemplated at a dis -- However there are varying opinions about that .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 11]: The climate of San Francisco is mild and singularly equable .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 11]: The thermometer stands at about seventy degrees the year round .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 6]: It hardly changes at all .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 19]: You sleep under one or two light blankets Summer and Winter , and never use a mosquito bar .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 6]: Nobody ever wears Summer clothing .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 19]: You wear black broadcloth -- if you have it -- in August and January , just the same .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 17]: It is no colder , and no warmer , in the one month than the other .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 12]: You do not use overcoats and you do not use fans .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 28]: It is as pleasant a climate as could well be contrived , take it all around , and is doubtless the most unvarying in the whole world .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 37]: The wind blows there a good deal in the summer months , but then you can go over to Oakland , if you choose -- three or four miles away -- it does not blow there .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 38]: It has only snowed twice in San Francisco in nineteen years , and then it only remained on the ground long enough to astonish the children , and set them to wondering what the feathery stuff was .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 25]: During eight months of the year , straight along , the skies are bright and cloudless , and never a drop of rain falls .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 19]: But when the other four months come along , you will need to go and steal an umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 6]: Because you will require it .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 16]: Not just one day , but one hundred and twenty days in hardly varying succession .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 39]: When you want to go visiting , or attend church , or the theatre , you never look up at the clouds to see whether it is likely to rain or not -- you look at the almanac .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 27]: If it is Winter , it will rain -- and if it is Summer , it wo n't rain , and you can not help it .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 15]: You never need a lightning-rod , because it never thunders and it never lightens .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 72]: And after you have listened for six or eight weeks , every night , to the dismal monotony of those quiet rains , you will wish in your heart the thunder would leap and crash and roar along those drowsy skies once , and make everything alive -- you will wish the prisoned lightnings would cleave the dull firmament asunder and light it with a blinding glare for one little instant .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 18]: You would give anything to hear the old familiar thunder again and see the lightning strike somebody .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 61]: And along in the Summer , when you have suffered about four months of lustrous , pitiless sunshine , you are ready to go down on your knees and plead for rain -- hail -- snow -- thunder and lightning -- anything to break the monotony -- you will take an earthquake , if you can not do any better .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 12]: And the chances are that you 'll get it , too .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 15]: San Francisco is built on sand hills , but they are prolific sand hills .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 6]: They yield a generous vegetation .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 34]: All the rare flowers which people in `` the States '' rear with such patient care in parlor flower-pots and green-houses , flourish luxuriantly in the open air there all the year round .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 27]: Calla lilies , all sorts of geraniums , passion flowers , moss roses -- I do not know the names of a tenth part of them .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 38]: I only know that while New Yorkers are burdened with banks and drifts of snow , Californians are burdened with banks and drifts of flowers , if they only keep their hands off and let them grow .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 51]: And I have heard that they have also that rarest and most curious of all the flowers , the beautiful Espiritu Santo , as the Spaniards call it -- or flower of the Holy Spirit -- though I thought it grew only in Central America -- down on the Isthmus .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 17]: In its cup is the daintiest little facsimile of a dove , as pure as snow .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 9]: The Spaniards have a superstitious reverence for it .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 36]: The blossom has been conveyed to the States , submerged in ether ; and the bulb has been taken thither also , but every attempt to make it bloom after it arrived , has failed .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 25]: I have elsewhere spoken of the endless Winter of Mono , California , and but this moment of the eternal Spring of San Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 21]: Now if we travel a hundred miles in a straight line , we come to the eternal Summer of Sacramento .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 18]: One never sees Summer-clothing or mosquitoes in San Francisco -- but they can be found in Sacramento .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 19]: Not always and unvaryingly , but about one hundred and forty-three months out of twelve years , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 35]: Flowers bloom there , always , the reader can easily believe -- people suffer and sweat , and swear , morning , noon and night , and wear out their stanchest energies fanning themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 19]: It gets hot there , but if you go down to Fort Yuma you will find it hotter .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 10]: Fort Yuma is probably the hottest place on earth .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 24]: The thermometer stays at one hundred and twenty in the shade there all the time -- except when it varies and goes higher .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 23]: It is a U.S. military post , and its occupants get so used to the terrific heat that they suffer without it .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 33]: There is a tradition -LRB- attributed to John Phenix -LSB- It has been purloined by fifty different scribblers who were too poor to invent a fancy but not ashamed to steal one .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 42]: -- M. T. -RSB- -RRB- that a very , very wicked soldier died there , once , and of course , went straight to the hottest corner of perdition , -- and the next day he telegraphed back for his blankets .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 19]: There is no doubt about the truth of this statement -- there can be no doubt about it .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 12]: I have seen the place where that soldier used to board .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 102]: In Sacramento it is fiery Summer always , and you can gather roses , and eat strawberries and ice-cream , and wear white linen clothes , and pant and perspire , at eight or nine o'clock in the morning , and then take the cars , and at noon put on your furs and your skates , and go skimming over frozen Donner Lake , seven thousand feet above the valley , among snow banks fifteen feet deep , and in the shadow of grand mountain peaks that lift their frosty crags ten thousand feet above the level of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 7]: There is a transition for you !
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 12]: Where will you find another like it in the Western hemisphere ?
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 108]: And some of us have swept around snow-walled curves of the Pacific Railroad in that vicinity , six thousand feet above the sea , and looked down as the birds do , upon the deathless Summer of the Sacramento Valley , with its fruitful fields , its feathery foliage , its silver streams , all slumbering in the mellow haze of its enchanted atmosphere , and all infinitely softened and spiritualized by distance -- a dreamy , exquisite glimpse of fairyland , made all the more charming and striking that it was caught through a forbidden gateway of ice and snow , and savage crags and precipices .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVII .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 56]: It was in this Sacramento Valley , just referred to , that a deal of the most lucrative of the early gold mining was done , and you may still see , in places , its grassy slopes and levels torn and guttered and disfigured by the avaricious spoilers of fifteen and twenty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 225]: You may see such disfigurements far and wide over California -- and in some such places , where only meadows and forests are visible -- not a living creature , not a house , no stick or stone or remnant of a ruin , and not a sound , not even a whisper to disturb the Sabbath stillness -- you will find it hard to believe that there stood at one time a fiercely-flourishing little city , of two thousand or three thousand souls , with its newspaper , fire company , brass band , volunteer militia , bank , hotels , noisy Fourth of July processions and speeches , gambling hells crammed with tobacco smoke , profanity , and rough-bearded men of all nations and colors , with tables heaped with gold dust sufficient for the revenues of a German principality -- streets crowded and rife with business -- town lots worth four hundred dollars a front foot -- labor , laughter , music , dancing , swearing , fighting , shooting , stabbing -- a bloody inquest and a man for breakfast every morning -- everything that delights and adorns existence -- all the appointments and appurtenances of a thriving and prosperous and promising young city , -- and now nothing is left of it all but a lifeless , homeless solitude .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 19]: The men are gone , the houses have vanished , even the name of the place is forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 26]: In no other land , in modern times , have towns so absolutely died and disappeared , as in the old mining regions of California .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 13]: It was a driving , vigorous , restless population in those days .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 6]: It was a curious population .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 32]: It was the only population of the kind that the world has ever seen gathered together , and it is not likely that the world will ever see its like again .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 66]: For observe , it was an assemblage of two hundred thousand young men -- not simpering , dainty , kid-gloved weaklings , but stalwart , muscular , dauntless young braves , brimful of push and energy , and royally endowed with every attribute that goes to make up a peerless and magnificent manhood -- the very pick and choice of the world 's glorious ones .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 49]: No women , no children , no gray and stooping veterans , -- none but erect , bright-eyed , quick-moving , strong-handed young giants -- the strangest population , the finest population , the most gallant host that ever trooped down the startled solitudes of an unpeopled land .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 6]: And where are they now ?
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 59]: Scattered to the ends of the earth -- or prematurely aged and decrepit -- or shot or stabbed in street affrays -- or dead of disappointed hopes and broken hearts -- all gone , or nearly all -- victims devoted upon the altar of the golden calf -- the noblest holocaust that ever wafted its sacrificial incense heavenward .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 7]: It is pitiful to think upon .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 41]: It was a splendid population -- for all the slow , sleepy , sluggish-brained sloths staid at home -- you never find that sort of people among pioneers -- you can not build pioneers out of that sort of material .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 67]: It was that population that gave to California a name for getting up astounding enterprises and rushing them through with a magnificent dash and daring and a recklessness of cost or consequences , which she bears unto this day -- and when she projects a new surprise , the grave world smiles as usual , and says `` Well , that is California all over . ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 8]: But they were rough in those times !
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 18]: They fairly reveled in gold , whisky , fights , and fandangoes , and were unspeakably happy .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 46]: The honest miner raked from a hundred to a thousand dollars out of his claim a day , and what with the gambling dens and the other entertainments , he had n't a cent the next morning , if he had any sort of luck .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 63]: They cooked their own bacon and beans , sewed on their own buttons , washed their own shirts -- blue woollen ones ; and if a man wanted a fight on his hands without any annoying delay , all he had to do was to appear in public in a white shirt or a stove-pipe hat , and he would be accommodated .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 6]: For those people hated aristocrats .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 17]: They had a particular and malignant animosity toward what they called a `` biled shirt . ''
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 12]: It was a wild , free , disorderly , grotesque society !
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 18]: Men -- only swarming hosts of stalwart men -- nothing juvenile , nothing feminine , visible anywhere !
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 22]: In those days miners would flock in crowds to catch a glimpse of that rare and blessed spectacle , a woman !
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 24]: Old inhabitants tell how , in a certain camp , the news went abroad early in the morning that a woman was come !
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 25]: They had seen a calico dress hanging out of a wagon down at the camping-ground -- sign of emigrants from over the great plains .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 24]: Everybody went down there , and a shout went up when an actual , bona fide dress was discovered fluttering in the wind !
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 6]: The male emigrant was visible .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 10]: The miners said : `` Fetch her out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 36]: He said : `` It is my wife , gentlemen -- she is sick -- we have been robbed of money , provisions , everything , by the Indians -- we want to rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 5]: `` Fetch her out !
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 8]: We 've got to see her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 18]: `` But , gentlemen , the poor thing , she -- '' `` FETCH HER OUT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 89]: He `` fetched her out , '' and they swung their hats and sent up three rousing cheers and a tiger ; and they crowded around and gazed at her , and touched her dress , and listened to her voice with the look of men who listened to a memory rather than a present reality -- and then they collected twenty-five hundred dollars in gold and gave it to the man , and swung their hats again and gave three more cheers , and went home satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 53]: Once I dined in San Francisco with the family of a pioneer , and talked with his daughter , a young lady whose first experience in San Francisco was an adventure , though she herself did not remember it , as she was only two or three years old at the time .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 31]: Her father said that , after landing from the ship , they were walking up the street , a servant leading the party with the little girl in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 50]: And presently a huge miner , bearded , belted , spurred , and bristling with deadly weapons -- just down from a long campaign in the mountains , evidently-barred the way , stopped the servant , and stood gazing , with a face all alive with gratification and astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 17]: Then he said , reverently : `` Well , if it ai n't a child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 46]: And then he snatched a little leather sack out of his pocket and said to the servant : `` There 's a hundred and fifty dollars in dust , there , and I 'll give it to you to let me kiss the child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 5]: That anecdote is true .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 6]: But see how things change .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 32]: Sitting at that dinner-table , listening to that anecdote , if I had offered double the money for the privilege of kissing the same child , I would have been refused .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 11]: Seventeen added years have far more than doubled the price .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 64]: And while upon this subject I will remark that once in Star City , in the Humboldt Mountains , I took my place in a sort of long , post-office single file of miners , to patiently await my chance to peep through a crack in the cabin and get a sight of the splendid new sensation -- a genuine , live Woman !
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 42]: And at the end of half of an hour my turn came , and I put my eye to the crack , and there she was , with one arm akimbo , and tossing flap-jacks in a frying-pan with the other .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 24]: And she was one hundred and sixty-five -LSB- Being in calmer mood , now , I voluntarily knock off a hundred from that .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 15]: -- M.T. -RSB- years old , and had n't a tooth in her head .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVIII .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 37]: For a few months I enjoyed what to me was an entirely new phase of existence -- a butterfly idleness ; nothing to do , nobody to be responsible to , and untroubled with financial uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 15]: I fell in love with the most cordial and sociable city in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 16]: After the sage-brush and alkali deserts of Washoe , San Francisco was Paradise to me .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 48]: I lived at the best hotel , exhibited my clothes in the most conspicuous places , infested the opera , and learned to seem enraptured with music which oftener afflicted my ignorant ear than enchanted it , if I had had the vulgar honesty to confess it .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 18]: However , I suppose I was not greatly worse than the most of my countrymen in that .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 15]: I had longed to be a butterfly , and I was one at last .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 34]: I attended private parties in sumptuous evening dress , simpered and aired my graces like a born beau , and polkad and schottisched with a step peculiar to myself -- and the kangaroo .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 39]: In a word , I kept the due state of a man worth a hundred thousand dollars -LRB- prospectively , -RRB- and likely to reach absolute affluence when that silver-mine sale should be ultimately achieved in the East .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 28]: I spent money with a free hand , and meantime watched the stock sales with an interested eye and looked to see what might happen in Nevada .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 5]: Something very important happened .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 32]: The property holders of Nevada voted against the State Constitution ; but the folks who had nothing to lose were in the majority , and carried the measure over their heads .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 31]: But after all it did not immediately look like a disaster , though unquestionably it was one I hesitated , calculated the chances , and then concluded not to sell .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 56]: Stocks went on rising ; speculation went mad ; bankers , merchants , lawyers , doctors , mechanics , laborers , even the very washerwomen and servant girls , were putting up their earnings on silver stocks , and every sun that rose in the morning went down on paupers enriched and rich men beggared .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 7]: What a gambling carnival it was !
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 13]: Gould and Curry soared to six thousand three hundred dollars a foot !
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 22]: And then -- all of a sudden , out went the bottom and everything and everybody went to ruin and destruction !
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 5]: The wreck was complete .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 10]: The bubble scarcely left a microscopic moisture behind it .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 10]: I was an early beggar and a thorough one .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 13]: My hoarded stocks were not worth the paper they were printed on .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 6]: I threw them all away .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 41]: I , the cheerful idiot that had been squandering money like water , and thought myself beyond the reach of misfortune , had not now as much as fifty dollars when I gathered together my various debts and paid them .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 12]: I removed from the hotel to a very private boarding house .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 11]: I took a reporter 's berth and went to work .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 24]: I was not entirely broken in spirit , for I was building confidently on the sale of the silver mine in the east .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 8]: But I could not hear from Dan .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 8]: My letters miscarried or were not answered .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 14]: One day I did not feel vigorous and remained away from the office .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 25]: The next day I went down toward noon as usual , and found a note on my desk which had been there twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 44]: It was signed `` Marshall '' -- the Virginia reporter -- and contained a request that I should call at the hotel and see him and a friend or two that night , as they would sail for the east in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 12]: A postscript added that their errand was a big mining speculation !
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 10]: I was hardly ever so sick in my life .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 45]: I abused myself for leaving Virginia and entrusting to another man a matter I ought to have attended to myself ; I abused myself for remaining away from the office on the one day of all the year that I should have been there .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 22]: And thus berating myself I trotted a mile to the steamer wharf and arrived just in time to be too late .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 10]: The ship was in the stream and under way .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 45]: I comforted myself with the thought that may be the speculation would amount to nothing -- poor comfort at best -- and then went back to my slavery , resolved to put up with my thirty-five dollars a week and forget all about it .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 9]: A month afterward I enjoyed my first earthquake .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 22]: It was one which was long called the `` great '' earthquake , and is doubtless so distinguished till this day .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 12]: It was just after noon , on a bright October day .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 7]: I was coming down Third street .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 36]: The only objects in motion anywhere in sight in that thickly built and populous quarter , were a man in a buggy behind me , and a street car wending slowly up the cross street .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 10]: Otherwise , all was solitude and a Sabbath stillness .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 30]: As I turned the corner , around a frame house , there was a great rattle and jar , and it occurred to me that here was an item !
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 9]: -- no doubt a fight in that house .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 49]: Before I could turn and seek the door , there came a really terrific shock ; the ground seemed to roll under me in waves , interrupted by a violent joggling up and down , and there was a heavy grinding noise as of brick houses rubbing together .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 12]: I fell up against the frame house and hurt my elbow .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 58]: I knew what it was , now , and from mere reportorial instinct , nothing else , took out my watch and noted the time of day ; at that moment a third and still severer shock came , and as I reeled about on the pavement trying to keep my footing , I saw a sight !
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 34]: The entire front of a tall four-story brick building in Third street sprung outward like a door and fell sprawling across the street , raising a dust like a great volume of smoke !
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 34]: And here came the buggy -- overboard went the man , and in less time than I can tell it the vehicle was distributed in small fragments along three hundred yards of street .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 18]: One could have fancied that somebody had fired a charge of chair-rounds and rags down the thoroughfare .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 54]: The street car had stopped , the horses were rearing and plunging , the passengers were pouring out at both ends , and one fat man had crashed half way through a glass window on one side of the car , got wedged fast and was squirming and screaming like an impaled madman .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 53]: Every door , of every house , as far as the eye could reach , was vomiting a stream of human beings ; and almost before one could execute a wink and begin another , there was a massed multitude of people stretching in endless procession down every street my position commanded .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 10]: Never was solemn solitude turned into teeming life quicker .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 43]: Of the wonders wrought by `` the great earthquake , '' these were all that came under my eye ; but the tricks it did , elsewhere , and far and wide over the town , made toothsome gossip for nine days .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 17]: The destruction of property was trifling -- the injury to it was wide-spread and somewhat serious .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 11]: The `` curiosities '' of the earthquake were simply endless .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 46]: Gentlemen and ladies who were sick , or were taking a siesta , or had dissipated till a late hour and were making up lost sleep , thronged into the public streets in all sorts of queer apparel , and some without any at all .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 27]: One woman who had been washing a naked child , ran down the street holding it by the ankles as if it were a dressed turkey .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 26]: Prominent citizens who were supposed to keep the Sabbath strictly , rushed out of saloons in their shirt-sleeves , with billiard cues in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 32]: Dozens of men with necks swathed in napkins , rushed from barber-shops , lathered to the eyes or with one cheek clean shaved and the other still bearing a hairy stubble .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 44]: Horses broke from stables , and a frightened dog rushed up a short attic ladder and out on to a roof , and when his scare was over had not the nerve to go down again the same way he had gone up .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 35]: A prominent editor flew down stairs , in the principal hotel , with nothing on but one brief undergarment -- met a chambermaid , and exclaimed : `` Oh , what shall I do !
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 6]: Where shall I go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 20]: She responded with naive serenity : `` If you have no choice , you might try a clothing-store ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 42]: A certain foreign consul 's lady was the acknowledged leader of fashion , and every time she appeared in anything new or extraordinary , the ladies in the vicinity made a raid on their husbands ' purses and arrayed themselves similarly .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 48]: One man who had suffered considerably and growled accordingly , was standing at the window when the shocks came , and the next instant the consul 's wife , just out of the bath , fled by with no other apology for clothing than -- a bath-towel !
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 24]: The sufferer rose superior to the terrors of the earthquake , and said to his wife : `` Now that is something like !
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 8]: Get out your towel my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 20]: The plastering that fell from ceilings in San Francisco that day , would have covered several acres of ground .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 31]: For some days afterward , groups of eyeing and pointing men stood about many a building , looking at long zig-zag cracks that extended from the eaves to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 29]: Four feet of the tops of three chimneys on one house were broken square off and turned around in such a way as to completely stop the draft .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 38]: A crack a hundred feet long gaped open six inches wide in the middle of one street and then shut together again with such force , as to ridge up the meeting earth like a slender grave .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 41]: A lady sitting in her rocking and quaking parlor , saw the wall part at the ceiling , open and shut twice , like a mouth , and then-drop the end of a brick on the floor like a tooth .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 18]: She was a woman easily disgusted with foolishness , and she arose and went out of there .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 28]: One lady who was coming down stairs was astonished to see a bronze Hercules lean forward on its pedestal as if to strike her with its club .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 21]: They both reached the bottom of the flight at the same time , -- the woman insensible from the fright .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 12]: Her child , born some little time afterward , was club-footed .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 25]: However -- on second thought , -- if the reader sees any coincidence in this , he must do it at his own risk .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 16]: The first shock brought down two or three huge organ-pipes in one of the churches .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 13]: The minister , with uplifted hands , was just closing the services .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 19]: He glanced up , hesitated , and said : `` However , we will omit the benediction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 17]: -- and the next instant there was a vacancy in the atmosphere where he had stood .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 15]: After the first shock , an Oakland minister said : `` Keep your seats !
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 26]: There is no better place to die than this '' -- And added , after the third : `` But outside is good enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 9]: He then skipped out at the back door .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 20]: Such another destruction of mantel ornaments and toilet bottles as the earthquake created , San Francisco never saw before .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 18]: There was hardly a girl or a matron in the city but suffered losses of this kind .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 32]: Suspended pictures were thrown down , but oftener still , by a curious freak of the earthquake 's humor , they were whirled completely around with their faces to the wall !
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 33]: There was great difference of opinion , at first , as to the course or direction the earthquake traveled , but water that splashed out of various tanks and buckets settled that .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 33]: Thousands of people were made so sea-sick by the rolling and pitching of floors and streets that they were weak and bed-ridden for hours , and some few for even days afterward .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 8]: -- Hardly an individual escaped nausea entirely .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 35]: The queer earthquake -- episodes that formed the staple of San Francisco gossip for the next week would fill a much larger book than this , and so I will diverge from the subject .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 35]: By and by , in the due course of things , I picked up a copy of the Enterprise one day , and fell under this cruel blow : NEVADA MINES IN NEW YORK .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 65]: -- G. M. Marshall , Sheba Hurs and Amos H. Rose , who left San Francisco last July for New York City , with ores from mines in Pine Wood District , Humboldt County , and on the Reese River range , have disposed of a mine containing six thousand feet and called the Pine Mountains Consolidated , for the sum of $ 3,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 44]: The stamps on the deed , which is now on its way to Humboldt County , from New York , for record , amounted to $ 3,000 , which is said to be the largest amount of stamps ever placed on one document .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 35]: A working capital of $ 1,000,000 has been paid into the treasury , and machinery has already been purchased for a large quartz mill , which will be put up as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 13]: The stock in this company is all full paid and entirely unassessable .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 18]: The ores of the mines in this district somewhat resemble those of the Sheba mine in Humboldt .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 31]: Sheba Hurst , the discoverer of the mines , with his friends corralled all the best leads and all the land and timber they desired before making public their whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 23]: Ores from there , assayed in this city , showed them to be exceedingly rich in silver and gold -- silver predominating .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 12]: There is an abundance of wood and water in the District .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 22]: We are glad to know that New York capital has been enlisted in the development of the mines of this region .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 24]: Having seen the ores and assays , we are satisfied that the mines of the District are very valuable -- anything but wild-cat .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 16]: Once more native imbecility had carried the day , and I had lost a million !
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 10]: It was the `` blind lead '' over again .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 9]: Let us not dwell on this miserable matter .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 34]: If I were inventing these things , I could be wonderfully humorous over them ; but they are too true to be talked of with hearty levity , even at this distant day .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 16]: -LSB- True , and yet not exactly as given in the above figures , possibly .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 25]: I saw Marshall , months afterward , and although he had plenty of money he did not claim to have captured an entire million .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 13]: In fact I gathered that he had not then received $ 50,000 .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 17]: Beyond that figure his fortune appeared to consist of uncertain vast expectations rather than prodigious certainties .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 27]: However , when the above item appeared in print I put full faith in it , and incontinently wilted and went to seed under it . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 39]: Suffice it that I so lost heart , and so yielded myself up to repinings and sighings and foolish regrets , that I neglected my duties and became about worthless , as a reporter for a brisk newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 40]: And at last one of the proprietors took me aside , with a charity I still remember with considerable respect , and gave me an opportunity to resign my berth and so save myself the disgrace of a dismissal .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIX .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 12]: For a time I wrote literary screeds for the Golden Era .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 59]: C. H. Webb had established a very excellent literary weekly called the Californian , but high merit was no guaranty of success ; it languished , and he sold out to three printers , and Bret Harte became editor at $ 20 a week , and I was employed to contribute an article a week at $ 12 .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 41]: But the journal still languished , and the printers sold out to Captain Ogden , a rich man and a pleasant gentleman who chose to amuse himself with such an expensive luxury without much caring about the cost of it .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 30]: When he grew tired of the novelty , he re-sold to the printers , the paper presently died a peaceful death , and I was out of work again .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 27]: I would not mention these things but for the fact that they so aptly illustrate the ups and downs that characterize life on the Pacific coast .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 17]: A man could hardly stumble into such a variety of queer vicissitudes in any other country .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 34]: For two months my sole occupation was avoiding acquaintances ; for during that time I did not earn a penny , or buy an article of any kind , or pay my board .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 10]: I became a very adept at `` slinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 65]: I slunk from back street to back street , I slunk away from approaching faces that looked familiar , I slunk to my meals , ate them humbly and with a mute apology for every mouthful I robbed my generous landlady of , and at midnight , after wanderings that were but slinkings away from cheerfulness and light , I slunk to my bed .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 13]: I felt meaner , and lowlier and more despicable than the worms .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 49]: During all this time I had but one piece of money -- a silver ten cent piece -- and I held to it and would not spend it on any account , lest the consciousness coming strong upon me that I was entirely penniless , might suggest suicide .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 27]: I had pawned every thing but the clothes I had on ; so I clung to my dime desperately , till it was smooth with handling .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 6]: However , I am forgetting .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 13]: I did have one other occupation beside that of `` slinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 40]: It was the entertaining of a collector -LRB- and being entertained by him , -RRB- who had in his hands the Virginia banker 's bill for forty-six dollars which I had loaned my schoolmate , the `` Prodigal . ''
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 17]: This man used to call regularly once a week and dun me , and sometimes oftener .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 17]: He did it from sheer force of habit , for he knew he could get nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 69]: He would get out his bill , calculate the interest for me , at five per cent a month , and show me clearly that there was no attempt at fraud in it and no mistakes ; and then plead , and argue and dun with all his might for any sum -- any little trifle -- even a dollar -- even half a dollar , on account .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 10]: Then his duty was accomplished and his conscience free .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 59]: He immediately dropped the subject there always ; got out a couple of cigars and divided , put his feet in the window , and then we would have a long , luxurious talk about everything and everybody , and he would furnish me a world of curious dunning adventures out of the ample store in his memory .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 33]: By and by he would clap his hat on his head , shake hands and say briskly : `` Well , business is business -- ca n't stay with you always ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 8]: -- and was off in a second .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 8]: The idea of pining for a dun !
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 34]: And yet I used to long for him to come , and would get as uneasy as any mother if the day went by without his visit , when I was expecting him .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 15]: But he never collected that bill , at last nor any part of it .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 10]: I lived to pay it to the banker myself .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 4]: Misery loves company .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 24]: Now and then at night , in out-of-the way , dimly lighted places , I found myself happening on another child of misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 23]: He looked so seedy and forlorn , so homeless and friendless and forsaken , that I yearned toward him as a brother .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 16]: I wanted to claim kinship with him and go about and enjoy our wretchedness together .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 93]: The drawing toward each other must have been mutual ; at any rate we got to falling together oftener , though still seemingly by accident ; and although we did not speak or evince any recognition , I think the dull anxiety passed out of both of us when we saw each other , and then for several hours we would idle along contentedly , wide apart , and glancing furtively in at home lights and fireside gatherings , out of the night shadows , and very much enjoying our dumb companionship .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 10]: Finally we spoke , and were inseparable after that .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 8]: For our woes were identical , almost .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 26]: He had been a reporter too , and lost his berth , and this was his experience , as nearly as I can recollect it .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 61]: After losing his berth he had gone down , down , down , with never a halt : from a boarding house on Russian Hill to a boarding house in Kearney street ; from thence to Dupont ; from thence to a low sailor den ; and from thence to lodgings in goods boxes and empty hogsheads near the wharves .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 41]: Then ; for a while , he had gained a meagre living by sewing up bursted sacks of grain on the piers ; when that failed he had found food here and there as chance threw it in his way .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 40]: He had ceased to show his face in daylight , now , for a reporter knows everybody , rich and poor , high and low , and can not well avoid familiar faces in the broad light of day .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 16]: This mendicant Blucher -- I call him that for convenience -- was a splendid creature .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 61]: He was full of hope , pluck and philosophy ; he was well read and a man of cultivated taste ; he had a bright wit and was a master of satire ; his kindliness and his generous spirit made him royal in my eyes and changed his curb-stone seat to a throne and his damaged hat to a crown .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 24]: He had an adventure , once , which sticks fast in my memory as the most pleasantly grotesque that ever touched my sympathies .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 10]: He had been without a penny for two months .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 22]: He had shirked about obscure streets , among friendly dim lights , till the thing had become second nature to him .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 10]: But at last he was driven abroad in daylight .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 28]: The cause was sufficient ; he had not tasted food for forty-eight hours , and he could not endure the misery of his hunger in idle hiding .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 30]: He came along a back street , glowering at the loaves in bake-shop windows , and feeling that he could trade his life away for a morsel to eat .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 33]: The sight of the bread doubled his hunger ; but it was good to look at it , any how , and imagine what one might do if one only had it .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 39]: Presently , in the middle of the street he saw a shining spot -- looked again -- did not , and could not , believe his eyes -- turned away , to try them , then looked again .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 17]: It was a verity -- no vain , hunger-inspired delusion -- it was a silver dime !
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 28]: He snatched it -- gloated over it ; doubted it -- bit it -- found it genuine -- choked his heart down , and smothered a halleluiah .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 52]: Then he looked around -- saw that nobody was looking at him -- threw the dime down where it was before -- walked away a few steps , and approached again , pretending he did not know it was there , so that he could re-enjoy the luxury of finding it .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 40]: He walked around it , viewing it from different points ; then sauntered about with his hands in his pockets , looking up at the signs and now and then glancing at it and feeling the old thrill again .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 16]: Finally he took it up , and went away , fondling it in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 20]: He idled through unfrequented streets , stopping in doorways and corners to take it out and look at it .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 33]: By and by he went home to his lodgings -- an empty queens-ware hogshead , -- and employed himself till night trying to make up his mind what to buy with it .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 7]: But it was hard to do .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 10]: To get the most for it was the idea .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 44]: He knew that at the Miner 's Restaurant he could get a plate of beans and a piece of bread for ten cents ; or a fish-ball and some few trifles , but they gave `` no bread with one fish-ball '' there .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 69]: At French Pete 's he could get a veal cutlet , plain , and some radishes and bread , for ten cents ; or a cup of coffee -- a pint at least -- and a slice of bread ; but the slice was not thick enough by the eighth of an inch , and sometimes they were still more criminal than that in the cutting of it .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 17]: At seven o'clock his hunger was wolfish ; and still his mind was not made up .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 27]: He turned out and went up Merchant street , still ciphering ; and chewing a bit of stick , as is the way of starving men .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 20]: He passed before the lights of Martin 's restaurant , the most aristocratic in the city , and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 20]: It was a place where he had often dined , in better days , and Martin knew him well .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 57]: Standing aside , just out of the range of the light , he worshiped the quails and steaks in the show window , and imagined that may be the fairy times were not gone yet and some prince in disguise would come along presently and tell him to go in there and take whatever he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 15]: He chewed his stick with a hungry interest as he warmed to his subject .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 25]: Just at this juncture he was conscious of some one at his side , sure enough ; and then a finger touched his arm .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 19]: He looked up , over his shoulder , and saw an apparition -- a very allegory of Hunger !
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 30]: It was a man six feet high , gaunt , unshaven , hung with rags ; with a haggard face and sunken cheeks , and eyes that pleaded piteously .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 12]: This phantom said : `` Come with me -- please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 50]: He locked his arm in Blucher 's and walked up the street to where the passengers were few and the light not strong , and then facing about , put out his hands in a beseeching way , and said : `` Friend -- stranger -- look at me !
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 67]: Life is easy to you -- you go about , placid and content , as I did once , in my day -- you have been in there , and eaten your sumptuous supper , and picked your teeth , and hummed your tune , and thought your pleasant thoughts , and said to yourself it is a good world -- but you 've never suffered !
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 19]: You do n't know what trouble is -- you do n't know what misery is -- nor hunger !
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 4]: Look at me !
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 11]: Stranger have pity on a poor friendless , homeless dog !
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 17]: As God is my judge , I have not tasted food for eight and forty hours !
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 11]: -- look in my eyes and see if I lie !
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 19]: Give me the least trifle in the world to keep me from starving -- anything -- twenty-five cents !
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 10]: Do it , stranger -- do it , please .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 12]: It will be nothing to you , but life to me .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 18]: Do it , and I will go down on my knees and lick the dust before you !
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 16]: I will kiss your footprints -- I will worship the very ground you walk on !
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 4]: Only twenty-five cents !
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 10]: I am famishing -- perishing -- starving by inches !
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 10]: For God 's sake do n't desert me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 14]: Blucher was bewildered -- and touched , too -- stirred to the depths .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 3]: He reflected .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 3]: Thought again .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 16]: Then an idea struck him , and he said : `` Come with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 41]: He took the outcast 's arm , walked him down to Martin 's restaurant , seated him at a marble table , placed the bill of fare before him , and said : `` Order what you want , friend .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 9]: Charge it to me , Mr. Martin . ''
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 11]: `` All right , Mr. Blucher , '' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 100]: Then Blucher stepped back and leaned against the counter and watched the man stow away cargo after cargo of buckwheat cakes at seventy-five cents a plate ; cup after cup of coffee , and porter house steaks worth two dollars apiece ; and when six dollars and a half 's worth of destruction had been accomplished , and the stranger 's hunger appeased , Blucher went down to French Pete 's , bought a veal cutlet plain , a slice of bread , and three radishes , with his dime , and set to and feasted like a king !
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 26]: Take the episode all around , it was as odd as any that can be culled from the myriad curiosities of Californian life , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 3]: CHAPTER LX .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 34]: By and by , an old friend of mine , a miner , came down from one of the decayed mining camps of Tuolumne , California , and I went back with him .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 29]: We lived in a small cabin on a verdant hillside , and there were not five other cabins in view over the wide expanse of hill and forest .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 48]: Yet a flourishing city of two or three thousand population had occupied this grassy dead solitude during the flush times of twelve or fifteen years before , and where our cabin stood had once been the heart of the teeming hive , the centre of the city .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 32]: When the mines gave out the town fell into decay , and in a few years wholly disappeared -- streets , dwellings , shops , everything -- and left no sign .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 20]: The grassy slopes were as green and smooth and desolate of life as if they had never been disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 39]: The mere handful of miners still remaining , had seen the town spring up spread , grow and flourish in its pride ; and they had seen it sicken and die , and pass away like a dream .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 13]: With it their hopes had died , and their zest of life .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 27]: They had long ago resigned themselves to their exile , and ceased to correspond with their distant friends or turn longing eyes toward their early homes .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 15]: They had accepted banishment , forgotten the world and been forgotten of the world .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 50]: They were far from telegraphs and railroads , and they stood , as it were , in a living grave , dead to the events that stirred the globe 's great populations , dead to the common interests of men , isolated and outcast from brotherhood with their kind .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 19]: It was the most singular , and almost the most touching and melancholy exile that fancy can imagine .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 122]: -- One of my associates in this locality , for two or three months , was a man who had had a university education ; but now for eighteen years he had decayed there by inches , a bearded , rough-clad , clay-stained miner , and at times , among his sighings and soliloquizings , he unconsciously interjected vaguely remembered Latin and Greek sentences -- dead and musty tongues , meet vehicles for the thoughts of one whose dreams were all of the past , whose life was a failure ; a tired man , burdened with the present , and indifferent to the future ; a man without ties , hopes , interests , waiting for rest and the end .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 22]: In that one little corner of California is found a species of mining which is seldom or never mentioned in print .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 24]: It is called `` pocket mining '' and I am not aware that any of it is done outside of that little corner .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 50]: The gold is not evenly distributed through the surface dirt , as in ordinary placer mines , but is collected in little spots , and they are very wide apart and exceedingly hard to find , but when you do find one you reap a rich and sudden harvest .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 15]: There are not now more than twenty pocket miners in that entire little region .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 10]: I think I know every one of them personally .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 56]: I have known one of them to hunt patiently about the hill-sides every day for eight months without finding gold enough to make a snuff-box -- his grocery bill running up relentlessly all the time -- and then find a pocket and take out of it two thousand dollars in two dips of his shovel .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 44]: I have known him to take out three thousand dollars in two hours , and go and pay up every cent of his indebtedness , then enter on a dazzling spree that finished the last of his treasure before the night was gone .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 32]: And the next day he bought his groceries on credit as usual , and shouldered his pan and shovel and went off to the hills hunting pockets again happy and content .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 26]: This is the most fascinating of all the different kinds of mining , and furnishes a very handsome percentage of victims to the lunatic asylum .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 7]: Pocket hunting is an ingenious process .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 35]: You take a spadeful of earth from the hill-side and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash it gradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine sediment .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 21]: Whatever gold was in that earth has remained , because , being the heaviest , it has sought the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 16]: Among the sediment you will find half a dozen yellow particles no larger than pin-heads .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 4]: You are delighted .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 11]: You move off to one side and wash another pan .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 19]: If you find gold again , you move to one side further , and wash a third pan .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 23]: If you find no gold this time , you are delighted again , because you know you are on the right scent .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 60]: You lay an imaginary plan , shaped like a fan , with its handle up the hill -- for just where the end of the handle is , you argue that the rich deposit lies hidden , whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been washed down the hill , spreading farther and farther apart as they wandered .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 65]: And so you proceed up the hill , washing the earth and narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that you are outside the spread of the fan ; and at last , twenty yards up the hill your lines have converged to a point -- a single foot from that point you can not find any gold .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 62]: Your breath comes short and quick , you are feverish with excitement ; the dinner-bell may ring its clapper off , you pay no attention ; friends may die , weddings transpire , houses burn down , they are nothing to you ; you sweat and dig and delve with a frantic interest -- and all at once you strike it !
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 22]: Up comes a spadeful of earth and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and sprays of gold .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 10]: Sometimes that one spadeful is all -- $ 500 .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 21]: Sometimes the nest contains $ 10,000 , and it takes you three or four days to get it all out .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 40]: The pocket-miners tell of one nest that yielded $ 60,000 and two men exhausted it in two weeks , and then sold the ground for $ 10,000 to a party who never got $ 300 out of it afterward .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 7]: The hogs are good pocket hunters .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 51]: All the summer they root around the bushes , and turn up a thousand little piles of dirt , and then the miners long for the rains ; for the rains beat upon these little piles and wash them down and expose the gold , possibly right over a pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 15]: Two pockets were found in this way by the same man in one day .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 12]: One had $ 5,000 in it and the other $ 8,000 .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 18]: That man could appreciate it , for he had n't had a cent for about a year .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 24]: In Tuolumne lived two miners who used to go to the neighboring village in the afternoon and return every night with household supplies .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 26]: Part of the distance they traversed a trail , and nearly always sat down to rest on a great boulder that lay beside the path .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 18]: In the course of thirteen years they had worn that boulder tolerably smooth , sitting on it .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 13]: By and by two vagrant Mexicans came along and occupied the seat .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 16]: They began to amuse themselves by chipping off flakes from the boulder with a sledge-hammer .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 13]: They examined one of these flakes and found it rich with gold .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 8]: That boulder paid them $ 800 afterward .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 45]: But the aggravating circumstance was that these `` Greasers '' knew that there must be more gold where that boulder came from , and so they went panning up the hill and found what was probably the richest pocket that region has yet produced .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 14]: It took three months to exhaust it , and it yielded $ 120,000 .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 53]: The two American miners who used to sit on the boulder are poor yet , and they take turn about in getting up early in the morning to curse those Mexicans -- and when it comes down to pure ornamental cursing , the native American is gifted above the sons of men .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 44]: I have dwelt at some length upon this matter of pocket mining because it is a subject that is seldom referred to in print , and therefore I judged that it would have for the reader that interest which naturally attaches to novelty .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXI .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 48]: One of my comrades there -- another of those victims of eighteen years of unrequited toil and blighted hopes -- was one of the gentlest spirits that ever bore its patient cross in a weary exile : grave and simple Dick Baker , pocket-miner of Dead-House Gulch .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 50]: -- He was forty-six , gray as a rat , earnest , thoughtful , slenderly educated , slouchily dressed and clay-soiled , but his heart was finer metal than any gold his shovel ever brought to light -- than any , indeed , that ever was mined or minted .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 52]: Whenever he was out of luck and a little down-hearted , he would fall to mourning over the loss of a wonderful cat he used to own -LRB- for where women and children are not , men of kindly impulses take up with pets , for they must love something -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 36]: And he always spoke of the strange sagacity of that cat with the air of a man who believed in his secret heart that there was something human about it -- may be even supernatural .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 9]: I heard him talking about this animal once .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 37]: He said : `` Gentlemen , I used to have a cat here , by the name of Tom Quartz , which you 'd a took an interest in I reckon -- most any body would .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 17]: I had him here eight year -- and he was the remarkablest cat I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 48]: He was a large gray one of the Tom specie , an ' he had more hard , natchral sense than any man in this camp -- 'n' a power of dignity -- he would n't let the Gov ` ner of Californy be familiar with him .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 16]: He never ketched a rat in his life -- ` peared to be above it .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 8]: He never cared for nothing but mining .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 19]: He knowed more about mining , that cat did , than any man I ever , ever see .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 27]: You could n't tell him noth 'n ` bout placer diggin 's -- 'n' as for pocket mining , why he was just born for it .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 39]: `` He would dig out after me an ' Jim when we went over the hills prospect 'n' , and he would trot along behind us for as much as five mile , if we went so fur .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 19]: An ' he had the best judgment about mining ground -- why you never see anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 66]: When we went to work , he 'd scatter a glance around , 'n' if he did n't think much of the indications , he would give a look as much as to say , ` Well , I 'll have to get you to excuse me , ' 'n' without another word he 'd hyste his nose into the air 'n' shove for home .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 87]: But if the ground suited him , he would lay low 'n' keep dark till the first pan was washed , 'n' then he would sidle up 'n' take a look , an ' if there was about six or seven grains of gold he was satisfied -- he did n't want no better prospect 'n' that -- 'n' then he would lay down on our coats and snore like a steamboat till we 'd struck the pocket , an ' then get up 'n' superintend .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 8]: He was nearly lightnin ' on superintending .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 15]: `` Well , bye an ' bye , up comes this yer quartz excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 39]: Every body was into it -- every body was pick 'n' 'n' blast 'n' instead of shovelin ' dirt on the hill side -- every body was put 'n' down a shaft instead of scrapin ' the surface .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 20]: Noth 'n' would do Jim , but we must tackle the ledges , too , 'n' so we did .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 24]: We commenced put 'n' down a shaft , 'n' Tom Quartz he begin to wonder what in the Dickens it was all about .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 42]: He had n't ever seen any mining like that before , 'n' he was all upset , as you may say -- he could n't come to a right understanding of it no way -- it was too many for him .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 30]: He was down on it , too , you bet you -- he was down on it powerful -- 'n' always appeared to consider it the cussedest foolishness out .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 20]: But that cat , you know , was always agin new fangled arrangements -- somehow he never could abide'em .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 9]: You know how it is with old habits .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 38]: But by an ' by Tom Quartz begin to git sort of reconciled a little , though he never could altogether understand that eternal sinkin ' of a shaft an ' never pannin ' out any thing .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 21]: At last he got to comin ' down in the shaft , hisself , to try to cipher it out .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 62]: An ' when he 'd git the blues , 'n' feel kind o'scruffy , 'n' aggravated 'n' disgusted -- knowin ' as he did , that the bills was runnin ' up all the time an ' we war n't makin ' a cent -- he would curl up on a gunny sack in the corner an ' go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 41]: Well , one day when the shaft was down about eight foot , the rock got so hard that we had to put in a blast -- the first blast 'n' we 'd ever done since Tom Quartz was born .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 31]: An ' then we lit the fuse 'n' clumb out 'n' got off ` bout fifty yards -- 'n' forgot 'n' left Tom Quartz sound asleep on the gunny sack .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 108]: `` In ` bout a minute we seen a puff of smoke bust up out of the hole , 'n' then everything let go with an awful crash , 'n' about four million ton of rocks 'n' dirt 'n' smoke ` n ; splinters shot up ` bout a mile an ' a half into the air , an ' by George , right in the dead centre of it was old Tom Quartz a goin ' end over end , an ' a snortin ' an ' a sneez 'n' , an ' a clawin ' an ' a reachin ' for things like all possessed .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 16]: But it war n't no use , you know , it war n't no use .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 67]: An ' that was the last we see of him for about two minutes 'n' a half , an ' then all of a sudden it begin to rain rocks and rubbage , an ' directly he come down ker-whop about ten foot off f 'm where we stood Well , I reckon he was p ` raps the orneriest lookin ' beast you ever see .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 51]: One ear was sot back on his neck , 'n' his tail was stove up , 'n' his eye-winkers was swinged off , 'n' he was all blacked up with powder an ' smoke , an ' all sloppy with mud 'n' slush f 'm one end to the other .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 21]: `` Well sir , it war n't no use to try to apologize -- we could n't say a word .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 84]: He took a sort of a disgusted look at hisself , 'n' then he looked at us -- an ' it was just exactly the same as if he had said -- ` Gents , may be you think it 's smart to take advantage of a cat that ` ai n't had no experience of quartz minin ' , but I think different ' -- an ' then he turned on his heel 'n' marched off home without ever saying another word .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 7]: `` That was jest his style .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 28]: An ' may be you wo n't believe it , but after that you never see a cat so prejudiced agin quartz mining as what he was .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 29]: An ' by an ' bye when he did get to goin ' down in the shaft agin , you 'd ' a been astonished at his sagacity .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 64]: The minute we 'd tetch off a blast 'n' the fuse 'd begin to sizzle , he 'd give a look as much as to say : ` Well , I 'll have to git you to excuse me , ' an ' it was surpris 'n' the way he 'd shin out of that hole 'n' go f ' r a tree .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 2]: Sagacity ?
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 8]: It ai n't no name for it .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 5]: 'T was inspiration ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 23]: I said , `` Well , Mr. Baker , his prejudice against quartz-mining was remarkable , considering how he came by it .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 10]: Could n't you ever cure him of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 4]: `` Cure him !
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 41]: When Tom Quartz was sot once , he was always sot -- and you might a blowed him up as much as three million times 'n' you 'd never a broken him of his cussed prejudice agin quartz mining . ''
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 36]: The affection and the pride that lit up Baker 's face when he delivered this tribute to the firmness of his humble friend of other days , will always be a vivid memory with me .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 15]: At the end of two months we had never `` struck '' a pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 41]: We had panned up and down the hillsides till they looked plowed like a field ; we could have put in a crop of grain , then , but there would have been no way to get it to market .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 45]: We got many good `` prospects , '' but when the gold gave out in the pan and we dug down , hoping and longing , we found only emptiness -- the pocket that should have been there was as barren as our own .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 20]: -- At last we shouldered our pans and shovels and struck out over the hills to try new localities .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 20]: We prospected around Angel 's Camp , in Calaveras county , during three weeks , but had no success .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 35]: Then we wandered on foot among the mountains , sleeping under the trees at night , for the weather was mild , but still we remained as centless as the last rose of summer .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 23]: That is a poor joke , but it is in pathetic harmony with the circumstances , since we were so poor ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 58]: In accordance with the custom of the country , our door had always stood open and our board welcome to tramping miners -- they drifted along nearly every day , dumped their paust shovels by the threshold and took `` pot luck '' with us -- and now on our own tramp we never found cold hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 45]: Our wanderings were wide and in many directions ; and now I could give the reader a vivid description of the Big Trees and the marvels of the Yo Semite -- but what has this reader done to me that I should persecute him ?
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 16]: I will deliver him into the hands of less conscientious tourists and take his blessing .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 13]: Let me be charitable , though I fail in all virtues else .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 26]: Note : Some of the phrases in the above are mining technicalities , purely , and may be a little obscure to the general reader .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 71]: In `` placer diggings '' the gold is scattered all through the surface dirt ; in `` pocket '' diggings it is concentrated in one little spot ; in `` quartz '' the gold is in a solid , continuous vein of rock , enclosed between distinct walls of some other kind of stone -- and this is the most laborious and expensive of all the different kinds of mining .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 83]: `` Prospecting '' is hunting for a `` placer '' ; `` indications '' are signs of its presence ; `` panning out '' refers to the washing process by which the grains of gold are separated from the dirt ; a `` prospect '' is what one finds in the first panful of dirt -- and its value determines whether it is a good or a bad prospect , and whether it is worth while to tarry there or seek further .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXII .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 19]: After a three months ' absence , I found myself in San Francisco again , without a cent .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 89]: When my credit was about exhausted , -LRB- for I had become too mean and lazy , now , to work on a morning paper , and there were no vacancies on the evening journals , -RRB- I was created San Francisco correspondent of the Enterprise , and at the end of five months I was out of debt , but my interest in my work was gone ; for my correspondence being a daily one , without rest or respite , I got unspeakably tired of it .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 5]: I wanted another change .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 8]: The vagabond instinct was strong upon me .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 13]: Fortune favored and I got a new berth and a delightful one .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 26]: It was to go down to the Sandwich Islands and write some letters for the Sacramento Union , an excellent journal and liberal with employees .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 13]: We sailed in the propeller Ajax , in the middle of winter .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 20]: The almanac called it winter , distinctly enough , but the weather was a compromise between spring and summer .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 11]: Six days out of port , it became summer altogether .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 30]: We had some thirty passengers ; among them a cheerful soul by the name of Williams , and three sea-worn old whaleship captains going down to join their vessels .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 38]: These latter played euchre in the smoking room day and night , drank astonishing quantities of raw whisky without being in the least affected by it , and were the happiest people I think I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 14]: And then there was `` the old Admiral -- '' a retired whaleman .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 20]: He was a roaring , terrific combination of wind and lightning and thunder , and earnest , whole-souled profanity .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 9]: But nevertheless he was tender-hearted as a girl .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 32]: He was a raving , deafening , devastating typhoon , laying waste the cowering seas but with an unvexed refuge in the centre where all comers were safe and at rest .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 44]: Nobody could know the `` Admiral '' without liking him ; and in a sudden and dire emergency I think no friend of his would know which to choose -- to be cursed by him or prayed for by a less efficient person .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 57]: His Title of `` Admiral '' was more strictly `` official '' than any ever worn by a naval officer before or since , perhaps -- for it was the voluntary offering of a whole nation , and came direct from the people themselves without any intermediate red tape -- the people of the Sandwich Islands .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 22]: It was a title that came to him freighted with affection , and honor , and appreciation of his unpretending merit .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 37]: And in testimony of the genuineness of the title it was publicly ordained that an exclusive flag should be devised for him and used solely to welcome his coming and wave him God-speed in his going .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 48]: From that time forth , whenever his ship was signaled in the offing , or he catted his anchor and stood out to sea , that ensign streamed from the royal halliards on the parliament house and the nation lifted their hats to it with spontaneous accord .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 15]: Yet he had never fired a gun or fought a battle in his life .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 24]: When I knew him on board the Ajax , he was seventy-two years old and had plowed the salt water sixty-one of them .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 47]: For sixteen years he had gone in and out of the harbor of Honolulu in command of a whaleship , and for sixteen more had been captain of a San Francisco and Sandwich Island passenger packet and had never had an accident or lost a vessel .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 22]: The simple natives knew him for a friend who never failed them , and regarded him as children regard a father .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 15]: It was a dangerous thing to oppress them when the roaring Admiral was around .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 46]: Two years before I knew the Admiral , he had retired from the sea on a competence , and had sworn a colossal nine-jointed oath that he would `` never go within smelling distance of the salt water again as long as he lived . ''
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 7]: And he had conscientiously kept it .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 69]: That is to say , he considered he had kept it , and it would have been more than dangerous to suggest to him , even in the gentlest way , that making eleven long sea voyages , as a passenger , during the two years that had transpired since he `` retired , '' was only keeping the general spirit of it and not the strict letter .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 53]: The Admiral knew only one narrow line of conduct to pursue in any and all cases where there was a fight , and that was to shoulder his way straight in without an inquiry as to the rights or the merits of it , and take the part of the weaker side .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 49]: -- And this was the reason why he was always sure to be present at the trial of any universally execrated criminal to oppress and intimidate the jury with a vindictive pantomime of what he would do to them if he ever caught them out of the box .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 23]: And this was why harried cats and outlawed dogs that knew him confidently took sanctuary under his chair in time of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 59]: In the beginning he was the most frantic and bloodthirsty Union man that drew breath in the shadow of the Flag ; but the instant the Southerners began to go down before the sweep of the Northern armies , he ran up the Confederate colors and from that time till the end was a rampant and inexorable secessionist .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 43]: He hated intemperance with a more uncompromising animosity than any individual I have ever met , of either sex ; and he was never tired of storming against it and beseeching friends and strangers alike to be wary and drink with moderation .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 59]: And yet if any creature had been guileless enough to intimate that his absorbing nine gallons of `` straight '' whiskey during our voyage was any fraction short of rigid or inflexible abstemiousness , in that self-same moment the old man would have spun him to the uttermost parts of the earth in the whirlwind of his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 27]: Mind , I am not saying his whisky ever affected his head or his legs , for it did not , in even the slightest degree .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 15]: He was a capacious container , but he did not hold enough for that .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 26]: He took a level tumblerful of whisky every morning before he put his clothes on -- `` to sweeten his bilgewater , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 26]: -- He took another after he got the most of his clothes on , `` to settle his mind and give him his bearings . ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 41]: He then shaved , and put on a clean shirt ; after which he recited the Lord 's Prayer in a fervent , thundering bass that shook the ship to her kelson and suspended all conversation in the main cabin .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 67]: Then , at this stage , being invariably `` by the head , '' or `` by the stern , '' or `` listed to port or starboard , '' he took one more to `` put him on an even keel so that he would mind his hellum and not miss stays and go about , every time he came up in the wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 37]: -- And now , his state-room door swung open and the sun of his benignant face beamed redly out upon men and women and children , and he roared his `` Shipmets a ` hoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 33]: in a way that was calculated to wake the dead and precipitate the final resurrection ; and forth he strode , a picture to look at and a presence to enforce attention .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 116]: Stalwart and portly ; not a gray hair ; broadbrimmed slouch hat ; semi-sailor toggery of blue navy flannel -- roomy and ample ; a stately expanse of shirt-front and a liberal amount of black silk neck-cloth tied with a sailor knot ; large chain and imposing seals impending from his fob ; awe-inspiring feet , and `` a hand like the hand of Providence , '' as his whaling brethren expressed it ; wrist-bands and sleeves pushed back half way to the elbow , out of respect for the warm weather , and exposing hairy arms , gaudy with red and blue anchors , ships , and goddesses of liberty tattooed in India ink .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 18]: But these details were only secondary matters -- his face was the lodestone that chained the eye .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 79]: It was a sultry disk , glowing determinedly out through a weather beaten mask of mahogany , and studded with warts , seamed with scars , `` blazed '' all over with unfailing fresh slips of the razor ; and with cheery eyes , under shaggy brows , contemplating the world from over the back of a gnarled crag of a nose that loomed vast and lonely out of the undulating immensity that spread away from its foundations .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 25]: At his heels frisked the darling of his bachelor estate , his terrier `` Fan , '' a creature no larger than a squirrel .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 35]: The main part of his daily life was occupied in looking after `` Fan , '' in a motherly way , and doctoring her for a hundred ailments which existed only in his imagination .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 17]: The Admiral seldom read newspapers ; and when he did he never believed anything they said .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 24]: He read nothing , and believed in nothing , but `` The Old Guard , '' a secession periodical published in New York .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 21]: He carried a dozen copies of it with him , always , and referred to them for all required information .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 38]: If it was not there , he supplied it himself , out of a bountiful fancy , inventing history , names , dates , and every thing else necessary to make his point good in an argument .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 10]: Consequently he was a formidable antagonist in a dispute .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 22]: Whenever he swung clear of the record and began to create history , the enemy was helpless and had to surrender .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 37]: Indeed , the enemy could not keep from betraying some little spark of indignation at his manufactured history -- and when it came to indignation , that was the Admiral 's very `` best hold . ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 20]: He was always ready for a political argument , and if nobody started one he would do it himself .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 60]: With his third retort his temper would begin to rise , and within five minutes he would be blowing a gale , and within fifteen his smoking-room audience would be utterly stormed away and the old man left solitary and alone , banging the table with his fist , kicking the chairs , and roaring a hurricane of profanity .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 43]: It got so , after a while , that whenever the Admiral approached , with politics in his eye , the passengers would drop out with quiet accord , afraid to meet him ; and he would camp on a deserted field .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 14]: But he found his match at last , and before a full company .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 23]: At one time or another , everybody had entered the lists against him and been routed , except the quiet passenger Williams .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 17]: He had never been able to get an expression of opinion out of him on politics .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 42]: But now , just as the Admiral drew near the door and the company were about to slip out , Williams said : `` Admiral , are you certain about that circumstance concerning the clergymen you mentioned the other day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 12]: -- referring to a piece of the Admiral 's manufactured history .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 10]: Every one was amazed at the man 's rashness .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 11]: The idea of deliberately inviting annihilation was a thing incomprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 21]: The retreat came to a halt ; then everybody sat down again wondering , to await the upshot of it .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 10]: The Admiral himself was as surprised as any one .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 26]: He paused in the door , with his red handkerchief half raised to his sweating face , and contemplated the daring reptile in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 5]: `` Certain of it ?
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 6]: Am I certain of it ?
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 10]: Do you think I 've been lying about it ?
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 7]: What do you take me for ?
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 20]: Anybody that do n't know that circumstance , do n't know anything ; a child ought to know it .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 5]: Read up your history !
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 32]: Read it up ----- , and do n't come asking a man if he 's certain about a bit of ABC stuff that the very southern niggers know all about . ''
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 26]: Here the Admiral 's fires began to wax hot , the atmosphere thickened , the coming earthquake rumbled , he began to thunder and lighten .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 37]: Within three minutes his volcano was in full irruption and he was discharging flames and ashes of indignation , belching black volumes of foul history aloft , and vomiting red-hot torrents of profanity from his crater .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 19]: Meantime Williams sat silent , and apparently deeply and earnestly interested in what the old man was saying .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 45]: By and by , when the lull came , he said in the most deferential way , and with the gratified air of a man who has had a mystery cleared up which had been puzzling him uncomfortably : `` Now I understand it .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 132]: I always thought I knew that piece of history well enough , but was still afraid to trust it , because there was not that convincing particularity about it that one likes to have in history ; but when you mentioned every name , the other day , and every date , and every little circumstance , in their just order and sequence , I said to myself , this sounds something like -- this is history -- this is putting it in a shape that gives a man confidence ; and I said to myself afterward , I will just ask the Admiral if he is perfectly certain about the details , and if he is I will come out and thank him for clearing this matter up for me .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 36]: And that is what I want to do now -- for until you set that matter right it was nothing but just a confusion in my mind , without head or tail to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 14]: Nobody ever saw the Admiral look so mollified before , and so pleased .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 45]: Nobody had ever received his bogus history as gospel before ; its genuineness had always been called in question either by words or looks ; but here was a man that not only swallowed it all down , but was grateful for the dose .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 19]: He was taken a back ; he hardly knew what to say ; even his profanity failed him .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 49]: Now , Williams continued , modestly and earnestly : `` But Admiral , in saying that this was the first stone thrown , and that this precipitated the war , you have overlooked a circumstance which you are perfectly familiar with , but which has escaped your memory .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 111]: Now I grant you that what you have stated is correct in every detail -- to wit : that on the 16th of October , 1860 , two Massachusetts clergymen , named Waite and Granger , went in disguise to the house of John Moody , in Rockport , at dead of night , and dragged forth two southern women and their two little children , and after tarring and feathering them conveyed them to Boston and burned them alive in the State House square ; and I also grant your proposition that this deed is what led to the secession of South Carolina on the 20th of December following .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 4]: Very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 39]: -LSB- Here the company were pleasantly surprised to hear Williams proceed to come back at the Admiral with his own invincible weapon -- clean , pure , manufactured history , without a word of truth in it . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 7]: `` Very well , I say .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 14]: But Admiral , why overlook the Willis and Morgan case in South Carolina ?
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 15]: You are too well informed a man not to know all about that circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 20]: Your arguments and your conversations have shown you to be intimately conversant with every detail of this national quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 47]: You develop matters of history every day that show plainly that you are no smatterer in it , content to nibble about the surface , but a man who has searched the depths and possessed yourself of everything that has a bearing upon the great question .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 35]: Therefore , let me just recall to your mind that Willis and Morgan case -- though I see by your face that the whole thing is already passing through your memory at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 162]: On the 12th of August , 1860 , two months before the Waite and Granger affair , two South Carolina clergymen , named John H. Morgan and Winthrop L. Willis , one a Methodist and the other an Old School Baptist , disguised themselves , and went at midnight to the house of a planter named Thompson -- Archibald F. Thompson , Vice President under Thomas Jefferson , -- and took thence , at midnight , his widowed aunt , -LRB- a Northern woman , -RRB- and her adopted child , an orphan -- named Mortimer Highie , afflicted with epilepsy and suffering at the time from white swelling on one of his legs , and compelled to walk on crutches in consequence ; and the two ministers , in spite of the pleadings of the victims , dragged them to the bush , tarred and feathered them , and afterward burned them at the stake in the city of Charleston .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 48]: You remember perfectly well what a stir it made ; you remember perfectly well that even the Charleston Courier stigmatized the act as being unpleasant , of questionable propriety , and scarcely justifiable , and likewise that it would not be matter of surprise if retaliation ensued .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 16]: And you remember also , that this thing was the cause of the Massachusetts outrage .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 10]: Who , indeed , were the two Massachusetts ministers ?
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 10]: and who were the two Southern women they burned ?
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 67]: I do not need to remind you , Admiral , with your intimate knowledge of history , that Waite was the nephew of the woman burned in Charleston ; that Granger was her cousin in the second degree , and that the woman they burned in Boston was the wife of John H. Morgan , and the still loved but divorced wife of Winthrop L. Willis .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 31]: Now , Admiral , it is only fair that you should acknowledge that the first provocation came from the Southern preachers and that the Northern ones were justified in retaliating .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 66]: In your arguments you never yet have shown the least disposition to withhold a just verdict or be in anywise unfair , when authoritative history condemned your position , and therefore I have no hesitation in asking you to take the original blame from the Massachusetts ministers , in this matter , and transfer it to the South Carolina clergymen where it justly belongs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 5]: The Admiral was conquered .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 68]: This sweet spoken creature who swallowed his fraudulent history as if it were the bread of life ; basked in his furious blasphemy as if it were generous sunshine ; found only calm , even-handed justice in his rampart partisanship ; and flooded him with invented history so sugarcoated with flattery and deference that there was no rejecting it , was `` too many '' for him .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 56]: He stammered some awkward , profane sentences about the ----- Willis and Morgan business having escaped his memory , but that he `` remembered it now , '' and then , under pretence of giving Fan some medicine for an imaginary cough , drew out of the battle and went away , a vanquished man .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 18]: Then cheers and laughter went up , and Williams , the ship 's benefactor was a hero .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 31]: The news went about the vessel , champagne was ordered , and enthusiastic reception instituted in the smoking room , and everybody flocked thither to shake hands with the conqueror .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 34]: The wheelman said afterward , that the Admiral stood up behind the pilot house and `` ripped and cursed all to himself '' till he loosened the smokestack guys and becalmed the mainsail .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 7]: The Admiral 's power was broken .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 28]: After that , if he began argument , somebody would bring Williams , and the old man would grow weak and begin to quiet down at once .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 65]: And as soon as he was done , Williams in his dulcet , insinuating way , would invent some history -LRB- referring for proof , to the old man 's own excellent memory and to copies of `` The Old Guard '' known not to be in his possession -RRB- that would turn the tables completely and leave the Admiral all abroad and helpless .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 47]: By and by he came to so dread Williams and his gilded tongue that he would stop talking when he saw him approach , and finally ceased to mention politics altogether , and from that time forward there was entire peace and serenity in the ship .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXIII .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 28]: On a certain bright morning the Islands hove in sight , lying low on the lonely sea , and everybody climbed to the upper deck to look .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 14]: After two thousand miles of watery solitude the vision was a welcome one .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 112]: As we approached , the imposing promontory of Diamond Head rose up out of the ocean its rugged front softened by the hazy distance , and presently the details of the land began to make themselves manifest : first the line of beach ; then the plumed coacoanut trees of the tropics ; then cabins of the natives ; then the white town of Honolulu , said to contain between twelve and fifteen thousand inhabitants spread over a dead level ; with streets from twenty to thirty feet wide , solid and level as a floor , most of them straight as a line and few as crooked as a corkscrew .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 13]: The further I traveled through the town the better I liked it .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 14]: Every step revealed a new contrast -- disclosed something I was unaccustomed to .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 320]: In place of the grand mud-colored brown fronts of San Francisco , I saw dwellings built of straw , adobies , and cream-colored pebble-and-shell-conglomerated coral , cut into oblong blocks and laid in cement ; also a great number of neat white cottages , with green window-shutters ; in place of front yards like billiard-tables with iron fences around them , I saw these homes surrounded by ample yards , thickly clad with green grass , and shaded by tall trees , through whose dense foliage the sun could scarcely penetrate ; in place of the customary geranium , calla lily , etc. , languishing in dust and general debility , I saw luxurious banks and thickets of flowers , fresh as a meadow after a rain , and glowing with the richest dyes ; in place of the dingy horrors of San Francisco 's pleasure grove , the `` Willows , '' I saw huge-bodied , wide-spreading forest trees , with strange names and stranger appearance -- trees that cast a shadow like a thunder-cloud , and were able to stand alone without being tied to green poles ; in place of gold fish , wiggling around in glass globes , assuming countless shades and degrees of distortion through the magnifying and diminishing qualities of their transparent prison houses , I saw cats -- Tom-cats , Mary Ann cats , long-tailed cats , bob-tailed cats , blind cats , one-eyed cats , wall-eyed cats , cross-eyed cats , gray cats , black cats , white cats , yellow cats , striped cats , spotted cats , tame cats , wild cats , singed cats , individual cats , groups of cats , platoons of cats , companies of cats , regiments of cats , armies of cats , multitudes of cats , millions of cats , and all of them sleek , fat , lazy and sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 153]: I looked on a multitude of people , some white , in white coats , vests , pantaloons , even white cloth shoes , made snowy with chalk duly laid on every morning ; but the majority of the people were almost as dark as negroes -- women with comely features , fine black eyes , rounded forms , inclining to the voluptuous , clad in a single bright red or white garment that fell free and unconfined from shoulder to heel , long black hair falling loose , gypsy hats , encircled with wreaths of natural flowers of a brilliant carmine tint ; plenty of dark men in various costumes , and some with nothing on but a battered stove-pipe hat tilted on the nose , and a very scant breech-clout ; -- certain smoke-dried children were clothed in nothing but sunshine -- a very neat fitting and picturesque apparel indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 337]: In place of roughs and rowdies staring and blackguarding on the corners , I saw long-haired , saddle-colored Sandwich Island maidens sitting on the ground in the shade of corner houses , gazing indolently at whatever or whoever happened along ; instead of wretched cobble-stone pavements , I walked on a firm foundation of coral , built up from the bottom of the sea by the absurd but persevering insect of that name , with a light layer of lava and cinders overlying the coral , belched up out of fathomless perdition long ago through the seared and blackened crater that stands dead and harmless in the distance now ; instead of cramped and crowded street-cars , I met dusky native women sweeping by , free as the wind , on fleet horses and astride , with gaudy riding-sashes , streaming like banners behind them ; instead of the combined stenches of Chinadom and Brannan street slaughter-houses , I breathed the balmy fragrance of jessamine , oleander , and the Pride of India ; in place of the hurry and bustle and noisy confusion of San Francisco , I moved in the midst of a Summer calm as tranquil as dawn in the Garden of Eden ; in place of the Golden City 's skirting sand hills and the placid bay , I saw on the one side a frame-work of tall , precipitous mountains close at hand , clad in refreshing green , and cleft by deep , cool , chasm-like valleys -- and in front the grand sweep of the ocean ; a brilliant , transparent green near the shore , bound and bordered by a long white line of foamy spray dashing against the reef , and further out the dead blue water of the deep sea , flecked with `` white caps , '' and in the far horizon a single , lonely sail -- a mere accent-mark to emphasize a slumberous calm and a solitude that were without sound or limit .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 41]: When the sun sunk down -- the one intruder from other realms and persistent in suggestions of them -- it was tranced luxury to sit in the perfumed air and forget that there was any world but these enchanted islands .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 16]: It was such ecstacy to dream , and dream -- till you got a bite .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 4]: A scorpion bite .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 44]: Then the first duty was to get up out of the grass and kill the scorpion ; and the next to bathe the bitten place with alcohol or brandy ; and the next to resolve to keep out of the grass in future .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 38]: Then came an adjournment to the bed-chamber and the pastime of writing up the day 's journal with one hand and the destruction of mosquitoes with the other -- a whole community of them at a slap .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 22]: Then , observing an enemy approaching , -- a hairy tarantula on stilts -- why not set the spittoon on him ?
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 22]: It is done , and the projecting ends of his paws give a luminous idea of the magnitude of his reach .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 29]: Then to bed and become a promenade for a centipede with forty-two legs on a side and every foot hot enough to burn a hole through a raw-hide .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 19]: More soaking with alcohol , and a resolution to examine the bed before entering it , in future .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 37]: Then wait , and suffer , till all the mosquitoes in the neighborhood have crawled in under the bar , then slip out quickly , shut them in and sleep peacefully on the floor till morning .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 13]: Meantime it is comforting to curse the tropics in occasional wakeful intervals .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 12]: We had an abundance of fruit in Honolulu , of course .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 33]: Oranges , pine-apples , bananas , strawberries , lemons , limes , mangoes , guavas , melons , and a rare and curious luxury called the chirimoya , which is deliciousness itself .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 6]: Then there is the tamarind .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 16]: I thought tamarinds were made to eat , but that was probably not the idea .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 17]: I ate several , and it seemed to me that they were rather sour that year .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 29]: They pursed up my lips , till they resembled the stem-end of a tomato , and I had to take my sustenance through a quill for twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 52]: They sharpened my teeth till I could have shaved with them , and gave them a `` wire edge '' that I was afraid would stay ; but a citizen said `` no , it will come off when the enamel does '' -- which was comforting , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 18]: I found , afterward , that only strangers eat tamarinds -- but they only eat them once .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXIV .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 36]: In my diary of our third day in Honolulu , I find this : I am probably the most sensitive man in Hawaii to-night -- especially about sitting down in the presence of my betters .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 29]: I have ridden fifteen or twenty miles on horse-back since 5 P.M. and to tell the honest truth , I have a delicacy about sitting down at all .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 33]: An excursion to Diamond Head and the King 's Coacoanut Grove was planned to-day -- time , 4:30 P.M. -- the party to consist of half a dozen gentlemen and three ladies .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 10]: They all started at the appointed hour except myself .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 38]: I was at the Government prison , -LRB- with Captain Fish and another whaleship-skipper , Captain Phillips , -RRB- and got so interested in its examination that I did not notice how quickly the time was passing .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 17]: Somebody remarked that it was twenty minutes past five o'clock , and that woke me up .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 41]: It was a fortunate circumstance that Captain Phillips was along with his `` turn out , '' as he calls a top-buggy that Captain Cook brought here in 1778 , and a horse that was here when Captain Cook came .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 55]: Captain Phillips takes a just pride in his driving and in the speed of his horse , and to his passion for displaying them I owe it that we were only sixteen minutes coming from the prison to the American Hotel -- a distance which has been estimated to be over half a mile .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 7]: But it took some fearful driving .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 120]: The Captain 's whip came down fast , and the blows started so much dust out of the horse 's hide that during the last half of the journey we rode through an impenetrable fog , and ran by a pocket compass in the hands of Captain Fish , a whaler of twenty-six years experience , who sat there through the perilous voyage as self-possessed as if he had been on the euchre-deck of his own ship , and calmly said , `` Port your helm -- port , '' from time to time , and `` Hold her a little free -- steady -- so -- so , '' and `` Luff -- hard down to starboard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 18]: and never once lost his presence of mind or betrayed the least anxiety by voice or manner .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 30]: When we came to anchor at last , and Captain Phillips looked at his watch and said , `` Sixteen minutes -- I told you it was in her !
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 9]: that 's over three miles an hour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 24]: I could see he felt entitled to a compliment , and so I said I had never seen lightning go like that horse .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 5]: And I never had .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 31]: The landlord of the American said the party had been gone nearly an hour , but that he could give me my choice of several horses that could overtake them .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 44]: I said , never mind -- I preferred a safe horse to a fast one -- I would like to have an excessively gentle horse -- a horse with no spirit whatever -- a lame one , if he had such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 15]: Inside of five minutes I was mounted , and perfectly satisfied with my outfit .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 30]: I had no time to label him `` This is a horse , '' and so if the public took him for a sheep I can not help it .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 11]: I was satisfied , and that was the main thing .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 41]: I could see that he had as many fine points as any man 's horse , and so I hung my hat on one of them , behind the saddle , and swabbed the perspiration from my face and started .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 15]: I named him after this island , `` Oahu '' -LRB- pronounced O-waw-hee -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 27]: The first gate he came to he started in ; I had neither whip nor spur , and so I simply argued the case with him .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 12]: He resisted argument , but ultimately yielded to insult and abuse .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 19]: He backed out of that gate and steered for another one on the other side of the street .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 7]: I triumphed by my former process .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 46]: Within the next six hundred yards he crossed the street fourteen times and attempted thirteen gates , and in the meantime the tropical sun was beating down and threatening to cave the top of my head in , and I was literally dripping with perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 18]: He abandoned the gate business after that and went along peaceably enough , but absorbed in meditation .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 16]: I noticed this latter circumstance , and it soon began to fill me with apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 38]: I said to my self , this creature is planning some new outrage , some fresh deviltry or other -- no horse ever thought over a subject so profoundly as this one is doing just for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 52]: The more this thing preyed upon my mind the more uneasy I became , until the suspense became almost unbearable and I dismounted to see if there was anything wild in his eye -- for I had heard that the eye of this noblest of our domestic animals is very expressive .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 23]: I can not describe what a load of anxiety was lifted from my mind when I found that he was only asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 23]: I woke him up and started him into a faster walk , and then the villainy of his nature came out again .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 15]: He tried to climb over a stone wall , five or six feet high .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 22]: I saw that I must apply force to this horse , and that I might as well begin first as last .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 20]: I plucked a stout switch from a tamarind tree , and the moment he saw it , he surrendered .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 46]: He broke into a convulsive sort of a canter , which had three short steps in it and one long one , and reminded me alternately of the clattering shake of the great earthquake , and the sweeping plunging of the Ajax in a storm .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 25]: And now there can be no fitter occasion than the present to pronounce a left-handed blessing upon the man who invented the American saddle .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 29]: There is no seat to speak of about it -- one might as well sit in a shovel -- and the stirrups are nothing but an ornamental nuisance .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 27]: If I were to write down here all the abuse I expended on those stirrups , it would make a large book , even without pictures .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 51]: Sometimes I got one foot so far through , that the stirrup partook of the nature of an anklet ; sometimes both feet were through , and I was handcuffed by the legs ; and sometimes my feet got clear out and left the stirrups wildly dangling about my shins .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 45]: Even when I was in proper position and carefully balanced upon the balls of my feet , there was no comfort in it , on account of my nervous dread that they were going to slip one way or the other in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 10]: But the subject is too exasperating to write about .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 65]: A mile and a half from town , I came to a grove of tall cocoanut trees , with clean , branchless stems reaching straight up sixty or seventy feet and topped with a spray of green foliage sheltering clusters of cocoa-nuts -- not more picturesque than a forest of collossal ragged parasols , with bunches of magnified grapes under them , would be .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 30]: I once heard a gouty northern invalid say that a cocoanut tree might be poetical , possibly it was ; but it looked like a feather-duster struck by lightning .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 31]: I think that describes it better than a picture -- and yet , without any question , there is something fascinating about a cocoa-nut tree -- and graceful , too .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 23]: About a dozen cottages , some frame and the others of native grass , nestled sleepily in the shade here and there .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 39]: The grass cabins are of a grayish color , are shaped much like our own cottages , only with higher and steeper roofs usually , and are made of some kind of weed strongly bound together in bundles .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 22]: The roofs are very thick , and so are the walls ; the latter have square holes in them for windows .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 21]: At a little distance these cabins have a furry appearance , as if they might be made of bear skins .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 8]: They are very cool and pleasant inside .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 22]: The King 's flag was flying from the roof of one of the cottages , and His Majesty was probably within .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 22]: He owns the whole concern thereabouts , and passes his time there frequently , on sultry days `` laying off . ''
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 11]: The spot is called `` The King 's Grove . ''
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 230]: Near by is an interesting ruin -- the meagre remains of an ancient heathen temple -- a place where human sacrifices were offered up in those old bygone days when the simple child of nature , yielding momentarily to sin when sorely tempted , acknowledged his error when calm reflection had shown it him , and came forward with noble frankness and offered up his grandmother as an atoning sacrifice -- in those old days when the luckless sinner could keep on cleansing his conscience and achieving periodical happiness as long as his relations held out ; long , long before the missionaries braved a thousand privations to come and make them permanently miserable by telling them how beautiful and how blissful a place heaven is , and how nearly impossible it is to get there ; and showed the poor native how dreary a place perdition is and what unnecessarily liberal facilities there are for going to it ; showed him how , in his ignorance he had gone and fooled away all his kinfolks to no purpose ; showed him what rapture it is to work all day long for fifty cents to buy food for next day with , as compared with fishing for pastime and lolling in the shade through eternal Summer , and eating of the bounty that nobody labored to provide but Nature .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 27]: How sad it is to think of the multitudes who have gone to their graves in this beautiful island and never knew there was a hell !
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 45]: This ancient temple was built of rough blocks of lava , and was simply a roofless inclosure a hundred and thirty feet long and seventy wide -- nothing but naked walls , very thick , but not much higher than a man 's head .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 12]: They will last for ages no doubt , if left unmolested .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 15]: Its three altars and other sacred appurtenances have crumbled and passed away years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 25]: It is said that in the old times thousands of human beings were slaughtered here , in the presence of naked and howling savages .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 82]: If these mute stones could speak , what tales they could tell , what pictures they could describe , of fettered victims writhing under the knife ; of massed forms straining forward out of the gloom , with ferocious faces lit up by the sacrificial fires ; of the background of ghostly trees ; of the dark pyramid of Diamond Head standing sentinel over the uncanny scene , and the peaceful moon looking down upon it through rifts in the cloud-rack !
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 84]: When Kamehameha -LRB- pronounced Ka-may-ha-may-ah -RRB- the Great -- who was a sort of a Napoleon in military genius and uniform success -- invaded this island of Oahu three quarters of a century ago , and exterminated the army sent to oppose him , and took full and final possession of the country , he searched out the dead body of the King of Oahu , and those of the principal chiefs , and impaled their heads on the walls of this temple .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 13]: Those were savage times when this old slaughter-house was in its prime .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 83]: The King and the chiefs ruled the common herd with a rod of iron ; made them gather all the provisions the masters needed ; build all the houses and temples ; stand all the expenses , of whatever kind ; take kicks and cuffs for thanks ; drag out lives well flavored with misery , and then suffer death for trifling offences or yield up their lives on the sacrificial altars to purchase favors from the gods for their hard rulers .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 48]: The missionaries have clothed them , educated them , broken up the tyrannous authority of their chiefs , and given them freedom and the right to enjoy whatever their hands and brains produce with equal laws for all , and punishment for all alike who transgress them .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 60]: The contrast is so strong -- the benefit conferred upon this people by the missionaries is so prominent , so palpable and so unquestionable , that the frankest compliment I can pay them , and the best , is simply to point to the condition of the Sandwich Islanders of Captain Cook 's time , and their condition to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 6]: Their work speaks for itself .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXV .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 23]: By and by , after a rugged climb , we halted on the summit of a hill which commanded a far-reaching view .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 35]: The moon rose and flooded mountain and valley and ocean with a mellow radiance , and out of the shadows of the foliage the distant lights of Honolulu glinted like an encampment of fireflies .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 10]: The air was heavy with the fragrance of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 5]: The halt was brief .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 21]: -- Gayly laughing and talking , the party galloped on , and I clung to the pommel and cantered after .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 18]: Presently we came to a place where no grass grew -- a wide expanse of deep sand .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 9]: They said it was an old battle ground .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 20]: All around everywhere , not three feet apart , the bleached bones of men gleamed white in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 10]: We picked up a lot of them for mementoes .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 59]: I got quite a number of arm bones and leg bones -- of great chiefs , may be , who had fought savagely in that fearful battle in the old days , when blood flowed like wine where we now stood -- and wore the choicest of them out on Oahu afterward , trying to make him go .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 42]: All sorts of bones could be found except skulls ; but a citizen said , irreverently , that there had been an unusual number of `` skull-hunters '' there lately -- a species of sportsmen I had never heard of before .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 19]: Nothing whatever is known about this place -- its story is a secret that will never be revealed .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 13]: The oldest natives make no pretense of being possessed of its history .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 11]: They say these bones were here when they were children .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 20]: They were here when their grandfathers were children -- but how they came here , they can only conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 40]: Many people believe this spot to be an ancient battle-ground , and it is usual to call it so ; and they believe that these skeletons have lain for ages just where their proprietors fell in the great fight .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 12]: Other people believe that Kamehameha I. fought his first battle here .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 39]: On this point , I have heard a story , which may have been taken from one of the numerous books which have been written concerning these islands -- I do not know where the narrator got it .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 37]: He said that when Kamehameha -LRB- who was at first merely a subordinate chief on the island of Hawaii -RRB- , landed here , he brought a large army with him , and encamped at Waikiki .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 56]: The Oahuans marched against him , and so confident were they of success that they readily acceded to a demand of their priests that they should draw a line where these bones now lie , and take an oath that , if forced to retreat at all , they would never retreat beyond this boundary .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 23]: The priests told them that death and everlasting punishment would overtake any who violated the oath , and the march was resumed .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 43]: Kamehameha drove them back step by step ; the priests fought in the front rank and exhorted them both by voice and inspiriting example to remember their oath -- to die , if need be , but never cross the fatal line .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 126]: The struggle was manfully maintained , but at last the chief priest fell , pierced to the heart with a spear , and the unlucky omen fell like a blight upon the brave souls at his back ; with a triumphant shout the invaders pressed forward -- the line was crossed -- the offended gods deserted the despairing army , and , accepting the doom their perjury had brought upon them , they broke and fled over the plain where Honolulu stands now -- up the beautiful Nuuanu Valley -- paused a moment , hemmed in by precipitous mountains on either hand and the frightful precipice of the Pari in front , and then were driven over -- a sheer plunge of six hundred feet !
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 41]: The story is pretty enough , but Mr. Jarves ' excellent history says the Oahuans were intrenched in Nuuanu Valley ; that Kamehameha ousted them , routed them , pursued them up the valley and drove them over the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 13]: He makes no mention of our bone-yard at all in his book .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 31]: Impressed by the profound silence and repose that rested over the beautiful landscape , and being , as usual , in the rear , I gave voice to my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 18]: I said : `` What a picture is here slumbering in the solemn glory of the moon !
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 16]: How strong the rugged outlines of the dead volcano stand out against the clear sky !
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 17]: What a snowy fringe marks the bursting of the surf over the long , curved reef !
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 11]: How calmly the dim city sleeps yonder in the plain !
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 16]: How soft the shadows lie upon the stately mountains that border the dream-haunted Mauoa Valley !
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 13]: What a grand pyramid of billowy clouds towers above the storied Pari !
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 43]: How the grim warriors of the past seem flocking in ghostly squadrons to their ancient battlefield again -- how the wails of the dying well up from the -- '' At this point the horse called Oahu sat down in the sand .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 8]: Sat down to listen , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 30]: Never mind what he heard , I stopped apostrophising and convinced him that I was not a man to allow contempt of Court on the part of a horse .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 19]: I broke the back-bone of a Chief over his rump and set out to join the cavalcade again .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 47]: Very considerably fagged out we arrived in town at 9 o'clock at night , myself in the lead -- for when my horse finally came to understand that he was homeward bound and had n't far to go , he turned his attention strictly to business .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 13]: This is a good time to drop in a paragraph of information .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 50]: There is no regular livery stable in Honolulu , or , indeed , in any part of the Kingdom of Hawaii ; therefore unless you are acquainted with wealthy residents -LRB- who all have good horses -RRB- , you must hire animals of the wretchedest description from the Kanakas .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 5]: -LRB- i.e. natives . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 42]: Any horse you hire , even though it be from a white man , is not often of much account , because it will be brought in for you from some ranch , and has necessarily been leading a hard life .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 47]: If the Kanakas who have been caring for him -LRB- inveterate riders they are -RRB- have not ridden him half to death every day themselves , you can depend upon it they have been doing the same thing by proxy , by clandestinely hiring him out .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 8]: At least , so I am informed .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 39]: The result is , that no horse has a chance to eat , drink , rest , recuperate , or look well or feel well , and so strangers go about the Islands mounted as I was to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 32]: In hiring a horse from a Kanaka , you must have all your eyes about you , because you can rest satisfied that you are dealing with a shrewd unprincipled rascal .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 64]: You may leave your door open and your trunk unlocked as long as you please , and he will not meddle with your property ; he has no important vices and no inclination to commit robbery on a large scale ; but if he can get ahead of you in the horse business , he will take a genuine delight in doing it .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 16]: This traits is characteristic of horse jockeys , the world over , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 58]: He will overcharge you if he can ; he will hire you a fine-looking horse at night -LRB- anybody 's -- may be the King 's , if the royal steed be in convenient view -RRB- , and bring you the mate to my Oahu in the morning , and contend that it is the same animal .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 37]: If you make trouble , he will get out by saying it was not himself who made the bargain with you , but his brother , `` who went out in the country this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 14]: They have always got a `` brother '' to shift the responsibility upon .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 32]: A victim said to one of these fellows one day : `` But I know I hired the horse of you , because I noticed that scar on your cheek . ''
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 22]: The reply was not bad : `` Oh , yes -- yes -- my brother all same -- we twins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 23]: A friend of mine , J. Smith , hired a horse yesterday , the Kanaka warranting him to be in excellent condition .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 22]: Smith had a saddle and blanket of his own , and he ordered the Kanaka to put these on the horse .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 29]: The Kanaka protested that he was perfectly willing to trust the gentleman with the saddle that was already on the animal , but Smith refused to use it .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 51]: The change was made ; then Smith noticed that the Kanaka had only changed the saddles , and had left the original blanket on the horse ; he said he forgot to change the blankets , and so , to cut the bother short , Smith mounted and rode away .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 19]: The horse went lame a mile from town , and afterward got to cutting up some extraordinary capers .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 26]: Smith got down and took off the saddle , but the blanket stuck fast to the horse -- glued to a procession of raw places .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 8]: The Kanaka 's mysterious conduct stood explained .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 28]: Another friend of mine bought a pretty good horse from a native , a day or two ago , after a tolerably thorough examination of the animal .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 17]: He discovered today that the horse was as blind as a bat , in one eye .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 43]: He meant to have examined that eye , and came home with a general notion that he had done it ; but he remembers now that every time he made the attempt his attention was called to something else by his victimizer .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 13]: One more instance , and then I will pass to something else .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 30]: I am informed that when a certain Mr. L. , a visiting stranger , was here , he bought a pair of very respectable-looking match horses from a native .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 21]: They were in a little stable with a partition through the middle of it -- one horse in each apartment .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 45]: Mr. L. examined one of them critically through a window -LRB- the Kanaka 's `` brother '' having gone to the country with the key -RRB- , and then went around the house and examined the other through a window on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 21]: He said it was the neatest match he had ever seen , and paid for the horses on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 12]: Whereupon the Kanaka departed to join his brother in the country .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 7]: The fellow had shamefully swindled L .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 26]: There was only one `` match '' horse , and he had examined his starboard side through one window and his port side through another !
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 40]: I decline to believe this story , but I give it because it is worth something as a fanciful illustration of a fixed fact -- namely , that the Kanaka horse-jockey is fertile in invention and elastic in conscience .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 29]: You can buy a pretty good horse for forty or fifty dollars , and a good enough horse for all practical purposes for two dollars and a half .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 16]: I estimate `` Oahu '' to be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty-five cents .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 98]: A good deal better animal than he is was sold here day before yesterday for a dollar and seventy-five cents , and sold again to-day for two dollars and twenty-five cents ; Williams bought a handsome and lively little pony yesterday for ten dollars ; and about the best common horse on the island -LRB- and he is a really good one -RRB- sold yesterday , with Mexican saddle and bridle , for seventy dollars -- a horse which is well and widely known , and greatly respected for his speed , good disposition and everlasting bottom .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 107]: You give your horse a little grain once a day ; it comes from San Francisco , and is worth about two cents a pound ; and you give him as much hay as he wants ; it is cut and brought to the market by natives , and is not very good it is baled into long , round bundles , about the size of a large man ; one of them is stuck by the middle on each end of a six foot pole , and the Kanaka shoulders the pole and walks about the streets between the upright bales in search of customers .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 35]: These hay bales , thus carried , have a general resemblance to a colossal capital ` H. ' The hay-bundles cost twenty-five cents apiece , and one will last a horse about a day .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 55]: You can get a horse for a song , a week 's hay for another song , and you can turn your animal loose among the luxuriant grass in your neighbor 's broad front yard without a song at all -- you do it at midnight , and stable the beast again before morning .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 29]: You have been at no expense thus far , but when you come to buy a saddle and bridle they will cost you from twenty to thirty-five dollars .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 31]: You can hire a horse , saddle and bridle at from seven to ten dollars a week , and the owner will take care of them at his own expense .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 13]: It is time to close this day 's record -- bed time .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 38]: As I prepare for sleep , a rich voice rises out of the still night , and , far as this ocean rock is toward the ends of the earth , I recognize a familiar home air .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 19]: But the words seem somewhat out of joint : `` Waikiki lantoni oe Kaa hooly hooly wawhoo . ''
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 13]: Translated , that means `` When we were marching through Georgia . ''
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXVI .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 37]: Passing through the market place we saw that feature of Honolulu under its most favorable auspices -- that is , in the full glory of Saturday afternoon , which is a festive day with the natives .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 48]: The native girls by twos and threes and parties of a dozen , and sometimes in whole platoons and companies , went cantering up and down the neighboring streets astride of fleet but homely horses , and with their gaudy riding habits streaming like banners behind them .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 24]: Such a troop of free and easy riders , in their natural home , the saddle , makes a gay and graceful spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 94]: The riding habit I speak of is simply a long , broad scarf , like a tavern table cloth brilliantly colored , wrapped around the loins once , then apparently passed between the limbs and each end thrown backward over the same , and floating and flapping behind on both sides beyond the horse 's tail like a couple of fancy flags ; then , slipping the stirrup-irons between her toes , the girl throws her chest for ward , sits up like a Major General and goes sweeping by like the wind .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 103]: The girls put on all the finery they can on Saturday afternoon -- fine black silk robes ; flowing red ones that nearly put your eyes out ; others as white as snow ; still others that discount the rainbow ; and they wear their hair in nets , and trim their jaunty hats with fresh flowers , and encircle their dusky throats with home-made necklaces of the brilliant vermillion-tinted blossom of the ohia ; and they fill the markets and the adjacent street with their bright presences , and smell like a rag factory on fire with their offensive cocoanut oil .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 40]: Occasionally you see a heathen from the sunny isles away down in the South Seas , with his face and neck tatooed till he looks like the customary mendicant from Washoe who has been blown up in a mine .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 132]: Some are tattooed a dead blue color down to the upper lip -- masked , as it were -- leaving the natural light yellow skin of Micronesia unstained from thence down ; some with broad marks drawn down from hair to neck , on both sides of the face , and a strip of the original yellow skin , two inches wide , down the center -- a gridiron with a spoke broken out ; and some with the entire face discolored with the popular mortification tint , relieved only by one or two thin , wavy threads of natural yellow running across the face from ear to ear , and eyes twinkling out of this darkness , from under shadowing hat-brims , like stars in the dark of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 31]: Moving among the stirring crowds , you come to the poi merchants , squatting in the shade on their hams , in true native fashion , and surrounded by purchasers .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 25]: -LRB- The Sandwich Islanders always squat on their hams , and who knows but they may be the old original `` ham sandwiches ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 8]: The thought is pregnant with interest . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 33]: The poi looks like common flour paste , and is kept in large bowls formed of a species of gourd , and capable of holding from one to three or four gallons .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 19]: Poi is the chief article of food among the natives , and is prepared from the taro plant .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 32]: The taro root looks like a thick , or , if you please , a corpulent sweet potato , in shape , but is of a light purple color when boiled .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 11]: When boiled it answers as a passable substitute for bread .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 63]: The buck Kanakas bake it under ground , then mash it up well with a heavy lava pestle , mix water with it until it becomes a paste , set it aside and let if ferment , and then it is poi -- and an unseductive mixture it is , almost tasteless before it ferments and too sour for a luxury afterward .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 6]: But nothing is more nutritious .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 24]: When solely used , however , it produces acrid humors , a fact which sufficiently accounts for the humorous character of the Kanakas .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 21]: I think there must be as much of a knack in handling poi as there is in eating with chopsticks .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 63]: The forefinger is thrust into the mess and stirred quickly round several times and drawn as quickly out , thickly coated , just as it it were poulticed ; the head is thrown back , the finger inserted in the mouth and the delicacy stripped off and swallowed -- the eye closing gently , meanwhile , in a languid sort of ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 31]: Many a different finger goes into the same bowl and many a different kind of dirt and shade and quality of flavor is added to the virtues of its contents .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 15]: Around a small shanty was collected a crowd of natives buying the awa root .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 45]: It is said that but for the use of this root the destruction of the people in former times by certain imported diseases would have been far greater than it was , and by others it is said that this is merely a fancy .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 54]: All agree that poi will rejuvenate a man who is used up and his vitality almost annihilated by hard drinking , and that in some kinds of diseases it will restore health after all medicines have failed ; but all are not willing to allow to the awa the virtues claimed for it .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 19]: The natives manufacture an intoxicating drink from it which is fearful in its effects when persistently indulged in .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 19]: It covers the body with dry , white scales , inflames the eyes , and causes premature decripitude .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 67]: Although the man before whose establishment we stopped has to pay a Government license of eight hundred dollars a year for the exclusive right to sell awa root , it is said that he makes a small fortune every twelve-month ; while saloon keepers , who pay a thousand dollars a year for the privilege of retailing whiskey , etc. , only make a bare living .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 24]: We found the fish market crowded ; for the native is very fond of fish , and eats the article raw and alive !
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 6]: Let us change the subject .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 12]: In old times here Saturday was a grand gala day indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 22]: All the native population of the town forsook their labors , and those of the surrounding country journeyed to the city .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 38]: Then the white folks had to stay indoors , for every street was so packed with charging cavaliers and cavalieresses that it was next to impossible to thread one 's way through the cavalcades without getting crippled .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 50]: At night they feasted and the girls danced the lascivious hula hula -- a dance that is said to exhibit the very perfection of educated notion of limb and arm , hand , head and body , and the exactest uniformity of movement and accuracy of `` time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 116]: It was performed by a circle of girls with no raiment on them to speak of , who went through an infinite variety of motions and figures without prompting , and yet so true was their `` time , '' and in such perfect concert did they move that when they were placed in a straight line , hands , arms , bodies , limbs and heads waved , swayed , gesticulated , bowed , stooped , whirled , squirmed , twisted and undulated as if they were part and parcel of a single individual ; and it was difficult to believe they were not moved in a body by some exquisite piece of mechanism .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 16]: Of late years , however , Saturday has lost most of its quondam gala features .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 45]: This weekly stampede of the natives interfered too much with labor and the interests of the white folks , and by sticking in a law here , and preaching a sermon there , and by various other means , they gradually broke it up .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 43]: The demoralizing hula hula was forbidden to be performed , save at night , with closed doors , in presence of few spectators , and only by permission duly procured from the authorities and the payment of ten dollars for the same .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 20]: There are few girls now-a-days able to dance this ancient national dance in the highest perfection of the art .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 10]: The missionaries have christianized and educated all the natives .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 34]: They all belong to the Church , and there is not one of them , above the age of eight years , but can read and write with facility in the native tongue .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 13]: It is the most universally educated race of people outside of China .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 22]: They have any quantity of books , printed in the Kanaka language , and all the natives are fond of reading .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 11]: They are inveterate church-goers -- nothing can keep them away .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 23]: All this ameliorating cultivation has at last built up in the native women a profound respect for chastity -- in other people .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 10]: Perhaps that is enough to say on that head .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 16]: The national sin will die out when the race does , but perhaps not earlier .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 45]: -- But doubtless this purifying is not far off , when we reflect that contact with civilization and the whites has reduced the native population from four hundred thousand -LRB- Captain Cook 's estimate , -RRB- to fifty-five thousand in something over eighty years !
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 15]: Society is a queer medley in this notable missionary , whaling and governmental centre .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 45]: If you get into conversation with a stranger and experience that natural desire to know what sort of ground you are treading on by finding out what manner of man your stranger is , strike out boldly and address him as `` Captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 25]: Watch him narrowly , and if you see by his countenance that you are on the wrong tack , ask him where he preaches .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 17]: It is a safe bet that he is either a missionary or captain of a whaler .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 12]: I am now personally acquainted with seventy-two captains and ninety-six missionaries .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 40]: The captains and ministers form one-half of the population ; the third fourth is composed of common Kanakas and mercantile foreigners and their families , and the final fourth is made up of high officers of the Hawaiian Government .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 13]: And there are just about cats enough for three apiece all around .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 22]: A solemn stranger met me in the suburbs the other day , and said : `` Good morning , your reverence .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 11]: Preach in the stone church yonder , no doubt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 7]: `` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 7]: I 'm not a preacher . ''
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 10]: `` Really , I beg your pardon , Captain .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 8]: I trust you had a good season .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 8]: How much oil '' -- `` Oil ?
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 7]: What do you take me for ?
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 7]: I 'm not a whaler . ''
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 12]: `` Oh , I beg a thousand pardons , your Excellency .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 11]: `` Major General in the household troops , no doubt ?
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 7]: Minister of the Interior , likely ?
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 4]: Secretary of war ?
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 6]: First Gentleman of the Bed-chamber ?
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 9]: Commissioner of the Royal '' -- `` Stuff !
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 5]: I 'm no official .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 12]: I 'm not connected in any way with the Government . ''
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 5]: `` Bless my life !
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 8]: Then , who the mischief are you ?
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 6]: what the mischief are you ?
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 19]: and how the mischief did you get here , and where in thunder did you come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 18]: `` I 'm only a private personage -- an unassuming stranger -- lately arrived from America . ''
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 3]: `` No ?
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 4]: Not a missionary !
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 4]: Not a whaler !
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 9]: not a member of his Majesty 's Government !
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 7]: not even Secretary of the Navy !
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 4]: Ah , Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 15]: it is too blissful to be true ; alas , I do but dream .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 36]: And yet that noble , honest countenance -- those oblique , ingenuous eyes -- that massive head , incapable of -- of -- anything ; your hand ; give me your hand , bright waif .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 4]: Excuse these tears .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 30]: For sixteen weary years I have yearned for a moment like this , and '' -- Here his feelings were too much for him , and he swooned away .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 12]: I pitied this poor creature from the bottom of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 5]: I was deeply moved .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 14]: I shed a few tears on him and kissed him for his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 13]: I then took what small change he had and `` shoved '' .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXVII .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 27]: I still quote from my journal : I found the national Legislature to consist of half a dozen white men and some thirty or forty natives .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 6]: It was a dark assemblage .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 36]: The nobles and Ministers -LRB- about a dozen of them altogether -RRB- occupied the extreme left of the hall , with David Kalakaua -LRB- the King 's Chamberlain -RRB- and Prince William at the head .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 21]: The President of the Assembly , His Royal Highness M. Kekuanaoa , -LSB- Kekuanaoa is not of the blood royal .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 18]: He derives his princely rank from his wife , who was a daughter of Kamehameha the Great .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 29]: Under other monarchies the male line takes precedence of the female in tracing genealogies , but here the opposite is the case -- the female line takes precedence .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 62]: Their reason for this is exceedingly sensible , and I recommend it to the aristocracy of Europe : They say it is easy to know who a man 's mother was , but , etc. , etc. -RSB- and the Vice President -LRB- the latter a white man , -RRB- sat in the pulpit , if I may so term it .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 8]: The President is the King 's father .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 24]: He is an erect , strongly built , massive featured , white-haired , tawny old gentleman of eighty years of age or thereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 29]: He was simply but well dressed , in a blue cloth coat and white vest , and white pantaloons , without spot , dust or blemish upon them .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 18]: He bears himself with a calm , stately dignity , and is a man of noble presence .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 24]: He was a young man and a distinguished warrior under that terrific fighter , Kamehameha I. , more than half a century ago .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 233]: A knowledge of his career suggested some such thought as this : `` This man , naked as the day he was born , and war-club and spear in hand , has charged at the head of a horde of savages against other hordes of savages more than a generation and a half ago , and reveled in slaughter and carnage ; has worshipped wooden images on his devout knees ; has seen hundreds of his race offered up in heathen temples as sacrifices to wooden idols , at a time when no missionary 's foot had ever pressed this soil , and he had never heard of the white man 's God ; has believed his enemy could secretly pray him to death ; has seen the day , in his childhood , when it was a crime punishable by death for a man to eat with his wife , or for a plebeian to let his shadow fall upon the King -- and now look at him ; an educated Christian ; neatly and handsomely dressed ; a high-minded , elegant gentleman ; a traveler , in some degree , and one who has been the honored guest of royalty in Europe ; a man practiced in holding the reins of an enlightened government , and well versed in the politics of his country and in general , practical information .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 58]: Look at him , sitting there presiding over the deliberations of a legislative body , among whom are white men -- a grave , dignified , statesmanlike personage , and as seemingly natural and fitted to the place as if he had been born in it and had never been out of it in his life time .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 18]: How the experiences of this old man 's eventful life shame the cheap inventions of romance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 20]: The christianizing of the natives has hardly even weakened some of their barbarian superstitions , much less destroyed them .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 9]: I have just referred to one of these .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 34]: It is still a popular belief that if your enemy can get hold of any article belonging to you he can get down on his knees over it and pray you to death .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 25]: Therefore many a native gives up and dies merely because he imagines that some enemy is putting him through a course of damaging prayer .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 37]: This praying an individual to death seems absurd enough at a first glance , but then when we call to mind some of the pulpit efforts of certain of our own ministers the thing looks plausible .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 24]: In former times , among the Islanders , not only a plurality of wives was customary , but a plurality of husbands likewise .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 13]: Some native women of noble rank had as many as six husbands .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 23]: A woman thus supplied did not reside with all her husbands at once , but lived several months with each in turn .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 11]: An understood sign hung at her door during these months .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 13]: When the sign was taken down , it meant `` NEXT . ''
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 14]: In those days woman was rigidly taught to `` know her place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 34]: Her place was to do all the work , take all the cuffs , provide all the food , and content herself with what was left after her lord had finished his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 54]: She was not only forbidden , by ancient law , and under penalty of death , to eat with her husband or enter a canoe , but was debarred , under the same penalty , from eating bananas , pine-apples , oranges and other choice fruits at any time or in any place .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 15]: She had to confine herself pretty strictly to `` poi '' and hard work .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 37]: These poor ignorant heathen seem to have had a sort of groping idea of what came of woman eating fruit in the garden of Eden , and they did not choose to take any more chances .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 11]: But the missionaries broke up this satisfactory arrangement of things .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 11]: They liberated woman and made her the equal of man .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 21]: The natives had a romantic fashion of burying some of their children alive when the family became larger than necessary .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 12]: The missionaries interfered in this matter too , and stopped it .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 28]: To this day the natives are able to lie down and die whenever they want to , whether there is anything the matter with them or not .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 35]: If a Kanaka takes a notion to die , that is the end of him ; nobody can persuade him to hold on ; all the doctors in the world could not save him .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 15]: A luxury which they enjoy more than anything else , is a large funeral .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 42]: If a person wants to get rid of a troublesome native , it is only necessary to promise him a fine funeral and name the hour and he will be on hand to the minute -- at least his remains will .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 27]: All the natives are Christians , now , but many of them still desert to the Great Shark God for temporary succor in time of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 29]: An irruption of the great volcano of Kilauea , or an earthquake , always brings a deal of latent loyalty to the Great Shark God to the surface .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 34]: It is common report that the King , educated , cultivated and refined Christian gentleman as he undoubtedly is , still turns to the idols of his fathers for help when disaster threatens .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 36]: A planter caught a shark , and one of his christianized natives testified his emancipation from the thrall of ancient superstition by assisting to dissect the shark after a fashion forbidden by his abandoned creed .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 8]: But remorse shortly began to torture him .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 43]: He grew moody and sought solitude ; brooded over his sin , refused food , and finally said he must die and ought to die , for he had sinned against the Great Shark God and could never know peace any more .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 32]: He was proof against persuasion and ridicule , and in the course of a day or two took to his bed and died , although he showed no symptom of disease .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 15]: His young daughter followed his lead and suffered a like fate within the week .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 24]: Superstition is ingrained in the native blood and bone and it is only natural that it should crop out in time of distress .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 44]: Wherever one goes in the Islands , he will find small piles of stones by the wayside , covered with leafy offerings , placed there by the natives to appease evil spirits or honor local deities belonging to the mythology of former days .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 45]: In the rural districts of any of the Islands , the traveler hourly comes upon parties of dusky maidens bathing in the streams or in the sea without any clothing on and exhibiting no very intemperate zeal in the matter of hiding their nakedness .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 33]: When the missionaries first took up their residence in Honolulu , the native women would pay their families frequent friendly visits , day by day , not even clothed with a blush .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 15]: It was found a hard matter to convince them that this was rather indelicate .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 49]: Finally the missionaries provided them with long , loose calico robes , and that ended the difficulty -- for the women would troop through the town , stark naked , with their robes folded under their arms , march to the missionary houses and then proceed to dress !
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 24]: -- The natives soon manifested a strong proclivity for clothing , but it was shortly apparent that they only wanted it for grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 40]: The missionaries imported a quantity of hats , bonnets , and other male and female wearing apparel , instituted a general distribution , and begged the people not to come to church naked , next Sunday , as usual .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 40]: And they did not ; but the national spirit of unselfishness led them to divide up with neighbors who were not at the distribution , and next Sabbath the poor preachers could hardly keep countenance before their vast congregations .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 171]: In the midst of the reading of a hymn a brown , stately dame would sweep up the aisle with a world of airs , with nothing in the world on but a `` stovepipe '' hat and a pair of cheap gloves ; another dame would follow , tricked out in a man 's shirt , and nothing else ; another one would enter with a flourish , with simply the sleeves of a bright calico dress tied around her waist and the rest of the garment dragging behind like a peacock 's tail off duty ; a stately `` buck '' Kanaka would stalk in with a woman 's bonnet on , wrong side before -- only this , and nothing more ; after him would stride his fellow , with the legs of a pair of pantaloons tied around his neck , the rest of his person untrammeled ; in his rear would come another gentleman simply gotten up in a fiery neck-tie and a striped vest .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 17]: The poor creatures were beaming with complacency and wholly unconscious of any absurdity in their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 59]: They gazed at each other with happy admiration , and it was plain to see that the young girls were taking note of what each other had on , as naturally as if they had always lived in a land of Bibles and knew what churches were made for ; here was the evidence of a dawning civilization .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 84]: The spectacle which the congregation presented was so extraordinary and withal so moving , that the missionaries found it difficult to keep to the text and go on with the services ; and by and by when the simple children of the sun began a general swapping of garments in open meeting and produced some irresistibly grotesque effects in the course of re-dressing , there was nothing for it but to cut the thing short with the benediction and dismiss the fantastic assemblage .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 41]: In our country , children play `` keep house ; '' and in the same high-sounding but miniature way the grown folk here , with the poor little material of slender territory and meagre population , play `` empire . ''
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 37]: There is his royal Majesty the King , with a New York detective 's income of thirty or thirty-five thousand dollars a year from the `` royal civil list '' and the `` royal domain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 10]: He lives in a two-story frame `` palace . ''
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 56]: And there is the `` royal family '' -- the customary hive of royal brothers , sisters , cousins and other noble drones and vagrants usual to monarchy , -- all with a spoon in the national pap-dish , and all bearing such titles as his or her Royal Highness the Prince or Princess So-and-so .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 32]: Few of them can carry their royal splendors far enough to ride in carriages , however ; they sport the economical Kanaka horse or `` hoof it '' with the plebeians .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 38]: Then there is his Excellency the `` royal Chamberlain '' -- a sinecure , for his majesty dresses himself with his own hands , except when he is ruralizing at Waikiki and then he requires no dressing .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 30]: Next we have his Excellency the Commander-in-chief of the Household Troops , whose forces consist of about the number of soldiers usually placed under a corporal in other lands .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 22]: Next comes the royal Steward and the Grand Equerry in Waiting -- high dignitaries with modest salaries and little to do .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 21]: Then we have his Excellency the First Gentleman of the Bed-chamber -- an office as easy as it is magnificent .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 84]: Next we come to his Excellency the Prime Minister , a renegade American from New Hampshire , all jaw , vanity , bombast and ignorance , a lawyer of `` shyster '' calibre , a fraud by nature , a humble worshipper of the sceptre above him , a reptile never tired of sneering at the land of his birth or glorifying the ten-acre kingdom that has adopted him -- salary , $ 4,000 a year , vast consequence , and no perquisites .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 70]: Then we have his Excellency the Imperial Minister of Finance , who handles a million dollars of public money a year , sends in his annual `` budget '' with great ceremony , talks prodigiously of `` finance , '' suggests imposing schemes for paying off the `` national debt '' -LRB- of $ 150,000 , -RRB- and does it all for $ 4,000 a year and unimaginable glory .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 51]: Next we have his Excellency the Minister of War , who holds sway over the royal armies -- they consist of two hundred and thirty uniformed Kanakas , mostly Brigadier Generals , and if the country ever gets into trouble with a foreign power we shall probably hear from them .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 21]: I knew an American whose copper-plate visiting card bore this impressive legend : `` Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Infantry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 15]: To say that he was proud of this distinction is stating it but tamely .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 29]: The Minister of War has also in his charge some venerable swivels on Punch-Bowl Hill wherewith royal salutes are fired when foreign vessels of war enter the port .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 29]: Next comes his Excellency the Minister of the Navy -- a nabob who rules the `` royal fleet , '' -LRB- a steam-tug and a sixty-ton schooner . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 74]: And next comes his Grace the Lord Bishop of Honolulu , the chief dignitary of the `` Established Church '' -- for when the American Presbyterian missionaries had completed the reduction of the nation to a compact condition of Christianity , native royalty stepped in and erected the grand dignity of an `` Established -LRB- Episcopal -RRB- Church '' over it , and imported a cheap ready-made Bishop from England to take charge .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 20]: The chagrin of the missionaries has never been comprehensively expressed , to this day , profanity not being admissible .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 10]: Next comes his Excellency the Minister of Public Instruction .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 30]: Next , their Excellencies the Governors of Oahu , Hawaii , etc. , and after them a string of High Sheriffs and other small fry too numerous for computation .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 60]: Then there are their Excellencies the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French ; her British Majesty 's Minister ; the Minister Resident , of the United States ; and some six or eight representatives of other foreign nations , all with sounding titles , imposing dignity and prodigious but economical state .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 20]: Imagine all this grandeur in a play-house `` kingdom '' whose population falls absolutely short of sixty thousand souls !
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 31]: The people are so accustomed to nine-jointed titles and colossal magnates that a foreign prince makes very little more stir in Honolulu than a Western Congressman does in New York .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 78]: And let it be borne in mind that there is a strictly defined `` court costume '' of so `` stunning '' a nature that it would make the clown in a circus look tame and commonplace by comparison ; and each Hawaiian official dignitary has a gorgeous vari-colored , gold-laced uniform peculiar to his office -- no two of them are alike , and it is hard to tell which one is the `` loudest .

Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 34]: The King had a `` drawing-room '' at stated intervals , like other monarchs , and when these varied uniforms congregate there -- weak-eyed people have to contemplate the spectacle through smoked glass .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 32]: Is there not a gratifying contrast between this latter-day exhibition and the one the ancestors of some of these magnates afforded the missionaries the Sunday after the old-time distribution of clothing ?
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 8]: Behold what religion and civilization have wrought !
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 23]: While I was in Honolulu I witnessed the ceremonious funeral of the King 's sister , her Royal Highness the Princess Victoria .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 28]: According to the royal custom , the remains had lain in state at the palace thirty days , watched day and night by a guard of honor .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 70]: And during all that time a great multitude of natives from the several islands had kept the palace grounds well crowded and had made the place a pandemonium every night with their howlings and wailings , beating of tom-toms and dancing of the -LRB- at other times -RRB- forbidden `` hula-hula '' by half-clad maidens to the music of songs of questionable decency chanted in honor of the deceased .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 93]: The printed programme of the funeral procession interested me at the time ; and after what I have just said of Hawaiian grandiloquence in the matter of `` playing empire , '' I am persuaded that a perusal of it may interest the reader : After reading the long list of dignitaries , etc. , and remembering the sparseness of the population , one is almost inclined to wonder where the material for that portion of the procession devoted to `` Hawaiian Population Generally '' is going to be procured : Undertaker .

Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 49]: I resume my journal at the point where the procession arrived at the royal mausoleum : As the procession filed through the gate , the military deployed handsomely to the right and left and formed an avenue through which the long column of mourners passed to the tomb .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 41]: The coffin was borne through the door of the mausoleum , followed by the King and his chiefs , the great officers of the kingdom , foreign Consuls , Embassadors and distinguished guests -LRB- Burlingame and General Van Valkenburgh -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 39]: Several of the kahilis were then fastened to a frame-work in front of the tomb , there to remain until they decay and fall to pieces , or , forestalling this , until another scion of royalty dies .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 22]: At this point of the proceedings the multitude set up such a heart-broken wailing as I hope never to hear again .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 21]: The soldiers fired three volleys of musketry -- the wailing being previously silenced to permit of the guns being heard .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 56]: His Highness Prince William , in a showy military uniform -LRB- the `` true prince , '' this -- scion of the house over-thrown by the present dynasty -- he was formerly betrothed to the Princess but was not allowed to marry her -RRB- , stood guard and paced back and forth within the door .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 31]: The privileged few who followed the coffin into the mausoleum remained sometime , but the King soon came out and stood in the door and near one side of it .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 129]: A stranger could have guessed his rank -LRB- although he was so simply and unpretentiously dressed -RRB- by the profound deference paid him by all persons in his vicinity ; by seeing his high officers receive his quiet orders and suggestions with bowed and uncovered heads ; and by observing how careful those persons who came out of the mausoleum were to avoid `` crowding '' him -LRB- although there was room enough in the doorway for a wagon to pass , for that matter -RRB- ; how respectfully they edged out sideways , scraping their backs against the wall and always presenting a front view of their persons to his Majesty , and never putting their hats on until they were well out of the royal presence .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 26]: He was dressed entirely in black -- dress-coat and silk hat -- and looked rather democratic in the midst of the showy uniforms about him .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 21]: On his breast he wore a large gold star , which was half hidden by the lapel of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 36]: He remained at the door a half hour , and occasionally gave an order to the men who were erecting the kahilis -LSB- Ranks of long-handled mops made of gaudy feathers -- sacred to royalty .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 14]: They are stuck in the ground around the tomb and left there . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 4]: before the tomb .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 31]: He had the good taste to make one of them substitute black crape for the ordinary hempen rope he was about to tie one of them to the frame-work with .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 20]: Finally he entered his carriage and drove away , and the populace shortly began to drop into his wake .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 28]: While he was in view there was but one man who attracted more attention than himself , and that was Harris -LRB- the Yankee Prime Minister -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 38]: This feeble personage had crape enough around his hat to express the grief of an entire nation , and as usual he neglected no opportunity of making himself conspicuous and exciting the admiration of the simple Kanakas .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 7]: noble ambition of this modern Richelieu !
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 39]: It is interesting to contrast the funeral ceremonies of the Princess Victoria with those of her noted ancestor Kamehameha the Conqueror , who died fifty years ago -- in 1819 , the year before the first missionaries came .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 30]: `` On the 8th of May , 1819 , at the age of sixty-six , he died , as he had lived , in the faith of his country .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 21]: It was his misfortune not to have come in contact with men who could have rightly influenced his religious aspirations .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 25]: Judged by his advantages and compared with the most eminent of his countrymen he may be justly styled not only great , but good .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 16]: To this day his memory warms the heart and elevates the national feelings of Hawaiians .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 48]: They are proud of their old warrior King ; they love his name ; his deeds form their historical age ; and an enthusiasm everywhere prevails , shared even by foreigners who knew his worth , that constitutes the firmest pillar of the throne of his dynasty .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 42]: `` In lieu of human victims -LRB- the custom of that age -RRB- , a sacrifice of three hundred dogs attended his obsequies -- no mean holocaust when their national value and the estimation in which they were held are considered .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 28]: The bones of Kamehameha , after being kept for a while , were so carefully concealed that all knowledge of their final resting place is now lost .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 48]: There was a proverb current among the common people that the bones of a cruel King could not be hid ; they made fish-hooks and arrows of them , upon which , in using them , they vented their abhorrence of his memory in bitter execrations . ''
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 43]: The account of the circumstances of his death , as written by the native historians , is full of minute detail , but there is scarcely a line of it which does not mention or illustrate some by-gone custom of the country .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 15]: In this respect it is the most comprehensive document I have yet met with .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 53]: I will quote it entire : `` When Kamehameha was dangerously sick , and the priests were unable to cure him , they said : ` Be of good courage and build a house for the god ' -LRB- his own private god or idol -RRB- , that thou mayest recover . '
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 25]: The chiefs corroborated this advice of the priests , and a place of worship was prepared for Kukailimoku , and consecrated in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 67]: They proposed also to the King , with a view to prolong his life , that human victims should be sacrificed to his deity ; upon which the greater part of the people absconded through fear of death , and concealed themselves in hiding places till the tabu -LSB- Tabu -LRB- pronounced tah-boo , -RRB- means prohibition -LRB- we have borrowed it , -RRB- or sacred .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 33]: The tabu was sometimes permanent , sometimes temporary ; and the person or thing placed under tabu was for the time being sacred to the purpose for which it was set apart .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 25]: In the above case the victims selected under the tabu would be sacred to the sacrifice -RSB- in which destruction impended , was past .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 46]: It is doubtful whether Kamehameha approved of the plan of the chiefs and priests to sacrifice men , as he was known to say , ` The men are sacred for the King ; ' meaning that they were for the service of his successor .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 10]: This information was derived from Liholiho , his son .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 23]: `` After this , his sickness increased to such a degree that he had not strength to turn himself in his bed .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 50]: When another season , consecrated for worship at the new temple -LRB- heiau -RRB- arrived , he said to his son , Liholiho , ` Go thou and make supplication to thy god ; I am not able to go , and will offer my prayers at home . '
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 39]: When his devotions to his feathered god , Kukailimoku , were concluded , a certain religiously disposed individual , who had a bird god , suggested to the King that through its influence his sickness might be removed .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 29]: The name of this god was Pua ; its body was made of a bird , now eaten by the Hawaiians , and called in their language alae .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 36]: Kamehameha was willing that a trial should be made , and two houses were constructed to facilitate the experiment ; but while dwelling in them he became so very weak as not to receive food .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 27]: After lying there three days , his wives , children and chiefs , perceiving that he was very low , returned him to his own house .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 32]: In the evening he was carried to the eating house , where he took a little food in his mouth which he did not swallow ; also a cup of water .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 60]: The chiefs requested him to give them his counsel ; but he made no reply , and was carried back to the dwelling house ; but when near midnight -- ten o'clock , perhaps -- he was carried again to the place to eat ; but , as before , he merely tasted of what was presented to him .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 38]: Then Kaikioewa addressed him thus : ` Here we all are , your younger brethren , your son Liholiho and your foreigner ; impart to us your dying charge , that Liholiho and Kaahumanu may hear . '
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 11]: Then Kamehameha inquired , ` What do you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 10]: Kaikioewa repeated , ` Your counsels for us . '
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 16]: `` He then said , ` Move on in my good way and -- . '
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 6]: He could proceed no further .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 11]: The foreigner , Mr. Young , embraced and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 21]: Hoapili also embraced him , whispering something in his ear , after which he was taken back to the house .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 30]: About twelve he was carried once more to the house for eating , into which his head entered , while his body was in the dwelling house immediately adjoining .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 27]: It should be remarked that this frequent carrying of a sick chief from one house to another resulted from the tabu system , then in force .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 67]: There were at that time six houses -LRB- huts -RRB- connected with an establishment -- one was for worship , one for the men to eat in , an eating house for the women , a house to sleep in , a house in which to manufacture kapa -LRB- native cloth -RRB- and one where , at certain intervals , the women might dwell in seclusion .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 30]: `` The sick was once more taken to his house , when he expired ; this was at two o'clock , a circumstance from which Leleiohoku derived his name .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 21]: As he breathed his last , Kalaimoku came to the eating house to order those in it to go out .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 33]: There were two aged persons thus directed to depart ; one went , the other remained on account of love to the King , by whom he had formerly been kindly sustained .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 7]: The children also were sent away .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 14]: Then Kalaimoku came to the house , and the chiefs had a consultation .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 18]: One of them spoke thus : ` This is my thought -- we will eat him raw .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 29]: -LSB- This sounds suspicious , in view of the fact that all Sandwich Island historians , white and black , protest that cannibalism never existed in the islands .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 20]: However , since they only proposed to `` eat him raw '' we `` wo n't count that '' .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 13]: But it would certainly have been cannibalism if they had cooked him .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 34]: -- M. T. -RSB- Kaahumanu -LRB- one of the dead King 's widows -RRB- replied , ` Perhaps his body is not at our disposal ; that is more properly with his successor .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 21]: Our part in him -- his breath -- has departed ; his remains will be disposed of by Liholiho . '
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 27]: `` After this conversation the body was taken into the consecrated house for the performance of the proper rites by the priest and the new King .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 41]: The name of this ceremony is uko ; and when the sacred hog was baked the priest offered it to the dead body , and it became a god , the King at the same time repeating the customary prayers .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 40]: `` Then the priest , addressing himself to the King and chiefs , said : ' I will now make known to you the rules to be observed respecting persons to be sacrificed on the burial of this body .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 27]: If you obtain one man before the corpse is removed , one will be sufficient ; but after it leaves this house four will be required .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 28]: If delayed until we carry the corpse to the grave there must be ten ; but after it is deposited in the grave there must be fifteen .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 25]: To-morrow morning there will be a tabu , and , if the sacrifice be delayed until that time , forty men must die . '
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 24]: `` Then the high priest , Hewahewa , inquired of the chiefs , ` Where shall be the residence of King Liholiho ? '
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 8]: They replied , ` Where , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 11]: You , of all men , ought to know . '
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 22]: Then the priest observed , ` There are two suitable places ; one is Kau , the other is Kohala . '
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 13]: The chiefs preferred the latter , as it was more thickly inhabited .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 29]: The priest added , ` These are proper places for the King 's residence ; but he must not remain in Kona , for it is polluted . '
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 5]: This was agreed to .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 7]: It was now break of day .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 23]: As he was being carried to the place of burial the people perceived that their King was dead , and they wailed .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 34]: When the corpse was removed from the house to the tomb , a distance of one chain , the procession was met by a certain man who was ardently attached to the deceased .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 25]: He leaped upon the chiefs who were carrying the King 's body ; he desired to die with him on account of his love .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 6]: The chiefs drove him away .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 11]: He persisted in making numerous attempts , which were unavailing .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 18]: Kalaimoka also had it in his heart to die with him , but was prevented by Hookio .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 33]: `` The morning following Kamehameha 's death , Liholiho and his train departed for Kohala , according to the suggestions of the priest , to avoid the defilement occasioned by the dead .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 47]: At this time if a chief died the land was polluted , and the heirs sought a residence in another part of the country until the corpse was dissected and the bones tied in a bundle , which being done , the season of defilement terminated .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 24]: If the deceased were not a chief , the house only was defiled which became pure again on the burial of the body .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 8]: Such were the laws on this subject .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 38]: `` On the morning on which Liholiho sailed in his canoe for Kohala , the chiefs and people mourned after their manner on occasion of a chief 's death , conducting themselves like madmen and like beasts .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 53]: Their conduct was such as to forbid description ; The priests , also , put into action the sorcery apparatus , that the person who had prayed the King to death might die ; for it was not believed that Kamehameha 's departure was the effect either of sickness or old age .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 60]: When the sorcerers set up by their fire-places sticks with a strip of kapa flying at the top , the chief Keeaumoku , Kaahumaun 's brother , came in a state of intoxication and broke the flag-staff of the sorcerers , from which it was inferred that Kaahumanu and her friends had been instrumental in the King 's death .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 10]: On this account they were subjected to abuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 14]: You have the contrast , now , and a strange one it is .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 45]: This great Queen , Kaahumanu , who was `` subjected to abuse '' during the frightful orgies that followed the King 's death , in accordance with ancient custom , afterward became a devout Christian and a steadfast and powerful friend of the missionaries .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 30]: Dogs were , and still are , reared and fattened for food , by the natives -- hence the reference to their value in one of the above paragraphs .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 53]: Forty years ago it was the custom in the Islands to suspend all law for a certain number of days after the death of a royal personage ; and then a saturnalia ensued which one may picture to himself after a fashion , but not in the full horror of the reality .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 63]: The people shaved their heads , knocked out a tooth or two , plucked out an eye sometimes , cut , bruised , mutilated or burned their flesh , got drunk , burned each other 's huts , maimed or murdered one another according to the caprice of the moment , and both sexes gave themselves up to brutal and unbridled licentiousness .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 26]: And after it all , came a torpor from which the nation slowly emerged bewildered and dazed , as if from a hideous half-remembered nightmare .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 18]: They were not the salt of the earth , those `` gentle children of the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 19]: The natives still keep up an old custom of theirs which can not be comforting to an invalid .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 36]: When they think a sick friend is going to die , a couple of dozen neighbors surround his hut and keep up a deafening wailing night and day till he either dies or gets well .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 17]: No doubt this arrangement has helped many a subject to a shroud before his appointed time .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 19]: They surround a hut and wail in the same heart-broken way when its occupant returns from a journey .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 9]: This is their dismal idea of a welcome .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 15]: A very little of it would go a great way with most of us .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXIX .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 50]: Bound for Hawaii -LRB- a hundred and fifty miles distant , -RRB- to visit the great volcano and behold the other notable things which distinguish that island above the remainder of the group , we sailed from Honolulu on a certain Saturday afternoon , in the good schooner Boomerang .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 18]: The Boomerang was about as long as two street cars , and about as wide as one .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 45]: She was so small -LRB- though she was larger than the majority of the inter-island coasters -RRB- that when I stood on her deck I felt but little smaller than the Colossus of Rhodes must have felt when he had a man-of-war under him .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 14]: I could reach the water when she lay over under a strong breeze .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 50]: When the Captain and my comrade -LRB- a Mr. Billings -RRB- , myself and four other persons were all assembled on the little after portion of the deck which is sacred to the cabin passengers , it was full -- there was not room for any more quality folks .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 46]: Another section of the deck , twice as large as ours , was full of natives of both sexes , with their customary dogs , mats , blankets , pipes , calabashes of poi , fleas , and other luxuries and baggage of minor importance .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 38]: As soon as we set sail the natives all lay down on the deck as thick as negroes in a slave-pen , and smoked , conversed , and spit on each other , and were truly sociable .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 19]: The little low-ceiled cabin below was rather larger than a hearse , and as dark as a vault .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 13]: It had two coffins on each side -- I mean two bunks .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 39]: A small table , capable of accommodating three persons at dinner , stood against the forward bulkhead , and over it hung the dingiest whale oil lantern that ever peopled the obscurity of a dungeon with ghostly shapes .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 8]: The floor room unoccupied was not extensive .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 16]: One might swing a cat in it , perhaps , but not a long cat .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 52]: The hold forward of the bulkhead had but little freight in it , and from morning till night a portly old rooster , with a voice like Baalam 's ass , and the same disposition to use it , strutted up and down in that part of the vessel and crowed .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 31]: He usually took dinner at six o'clock , and then , after an hour devoted to meditation , he mounted a barrel and crowed a good part of the night .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 32]: He got hoarser all the time , but he scorned to allow any personal consideration to interfere with his duty , and kept up his labors in defiance of threatened diphtheria .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 12]: Sleeping was out of the question when he was on watch .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 10]: He was a source of genuine aggravation and annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 32]: It was worse than useless to shout at him or apply offensive epithets to him -- he only took these things for applause , and strained himself to make more noise .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 27]: Occasionally , during the day , I threw potatoes at him through an aperture in the bulkhead , but he only dodged and went on crowing .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 40]: The first night , as I lay in my coffin , idly watching the dim lamp swinging to the rolling of the ship , and snuffing the nauseous odors of bilge water , I felt something gallop over me .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 5]: I turned out promptly .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 15]: However , I turned in again when I found it was only a rat .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 8]: Presently something galloped over me once more .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 31]: I knew it was not a rat this time , and I thought it might be a centipede , because the Captain had killed one on deck in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 4]: I turned out .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 36]: The first glance at the pillow showed me repulsive sentinel perched upon each end of it -- cockroaches as large as peach leaves -- fellows with long , quivering antennae and fiery , malignant eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 17]: They were grating their teeth like tobacco worms , and appeared to be dissatisfied about something .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 35]: I had often heard that these reptiles were in the habit of eating off sleeping sailors ' toe nails down to the quick , and I would not get in the bunk any more .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 7]: I lay down on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 22]: But a rat came and bothered me , and shortly afterward a procession of cockroaches arrived and camped in my hair .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 37]: In a few moments the rooster was crowing with uncommon spirit and a party of fleas were throwing double somersaults about my person in the wildest disorder , and taking a bite every time they struck .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 8]: I was beginning to feel really annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 13]: I got up and put my clothes on and went on deck .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 16]: The above is not overdrawn ; it is a truthful sketch of inter-island schooner life .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 20]: There is no such thing as keeping a vessel in elegant condition , when she carries molasses and Kanakas .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 163]: It was compensation for my sufferings to come unexpectedly upon so beautiful a scene as met my eye -- to step suddenly out of the sepulchral gloom of the cabin and stand under the strong light of the moon -- in the centre , as it were , of a glittering sea of liquid silver -- to see the broad sails straining in the gale , the ship heeled over on her side , the angry foam hissing past her lee bulwarks , and sparkling sheets of spray dashing high over her bows and raining upon her decks ; to brace myself and hang fast to the first object that presented itself , with hat jammed down and coat tails whipping in the breeze , and feel that exhilaration that thrills in one 's hair and quivers down his back bone when he knows that every inch of canvas is drawing and the vessel cleaving through the waves at her utmost speed .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 12]: There was no darkness , no dimness , no obscurity there .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 10]: All was brightness , every object was vividly defined .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 72]: Every prostrate Kanaka ; every coil of rope ; every calabash of poi ; every puppy ; every seam in the flooring ; every bolthead ; every object ; however minute , showed sharp and distinct in its every outline ; and the shadow of the broad mainsail lay black as a pall upon the deck , leaving Billings 's white upturned face glorified and his body in a total eclipse .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 11]: Monday morning we were close to the island of Hawaii .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 14]: Two of its high mountains were in view -- Mauna Loa and Hualaiai .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 21]: The latter is an imposing peak , but being only ten thousand feet high is seldom mentioned or heard of .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 11]: Mauna Loa is said to be sixteen thousand feet high .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 28]: The rays of glittering snow and ice , that clasped its summit like a claw , looked refreshing when viewed from the blistering climate we were in .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 108]: One could stand on that mountain -LRB- wrapped up in blankets and furs to keep warm -RRB- , and while he nibbled a snowball or an icicle to quench his thirst he could look down the long sweep of its sides and see spots where plants are growing that grow only where the bitter cold of Winter prevails ; lower down he could see sections devoted to production that thrive in the temperate zone alone ; and at the bottom of the mountain he could see the home of the tufted cocoa-palms and other species of vegetation that grow only in the sultry atmosphere of eternal Summer .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 36]: He could see all the climes of the world at a single glance of the eye , and that glance would only pass over a distance of four or five miles as the bird flies !
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 37]: By and by we took boat and went ashore at Kailua , designing to ride horseback through the pleasant orange and coffee region of Kona , and rejoin the vessel at a point some leagues distant .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 7]: This journey is well worth taking .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 95]: The trail passes along on high ground -- say a thousand feet above sea level -- and usually about a mile distant from the ocean , which is always in sight , save that occasionally you find yourself buried in the forest in the midst of a rank tropical vegetation and a dense growth of trees , whose great bows overarch the road and shut out sun and sea and everything , and leave you in a dim , shady tunnel , haunted with invisible singing birds and fragrant with the odor of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 53]: It was pleasant to ride occasionally in the warm sun , and feast the eye upon the ever-changing panorama of the forest -LRB- beyond and below us -RRB- , with its many tints , its softened lights and shadows , its billowy undulations sweeping gently down from the mountain to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 41]: It was pleasant also , at intervals , to leave the sultry sun and pass into the cool , green depths of this forest and indulge in sentimental reflections under the inspiration of its brooding twilight and its whispering foliage .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 14]: We rode through one orange grove that had ten thousand tree in it !
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 7]: They were all laden with fruit .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 12]: At one farmhouse we got some large peaches of excellent flavor .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 17]: This fruit , as a general thing , does not do well in the Sandwich Islands .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 14]: It takes a sort of almond shape , and is small and bitter .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 39]: It needs frost , they say , and perhaps it does ; if this be so , it will have a good opportunity to go on needing it , as it will not be likely to get it .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 34]: The trees from which the fine fruit I have spoken of , came , had been planted and replanted sixteen times , and to this treatment the proprietor of the orchard attributed his-success .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 13]: We passed several sugar plantations -- new ones and not very extensive .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 11]: The crops were , in most cases , third rattoons .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 3]: -LSB- NOTE .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 30]: -- The first crop is called `` plant cane ; '' subsequent crops which spring from the original roots , without replanting , are called `` rattoons . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 49]: Almost everywhere on the island of Hawaii sugar-cane matures in twelve months , both rattoons and plant , and although it ought to be taken off as soon as it tassels , no doubt , it is not absolutely necessary to do it until about four months afterward .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 20]: In Kona , the average yield of an acre of ground is two tons of sugar , they say .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 23]: This is only a moderate yield for these islands , but would be astounding for Louisiana and most other sugar growing countries .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 24]: The plantations in Kona being on pretty high ground -- up among the light and frequent rains -- no irrigation whatever is required .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXX .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 18]: We stopped some time at one of the plantations , to rest ourselves and refresh the horses .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 49]: We had a chatty conversation with several gentlemen present ; but there was one person , a middle aged man , with an absent look in his face , who simply glanced up , gave us good-day and lapsed again into the meditations which our coming had interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 11]: The planters whispered us not to mind him -- crazy .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 20]: They said he was in the Islands for his health ; was a preacher ; his home , Michigan .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 56]: They said that if he woke up presently and fell to talking about a correspondence which he had some time held with Mr. Greeley about a trifle of some kind , we must humor him and listen with interest ; and we must humor his fancy that this correspondence was the talk of the world .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 21]: It was easy to see that he was a gentle creature and that his madness had nothing vicious in it .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 19]: He looked pale , and a little worn , as if with perplexing thought and anxiety of mind .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 29]: He sat a long time , looking at the floor , and at intervals muttering to himself and nodding his head acquiescingly or shaking it in mild protest .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 12]: He was lost in his thought , or in his memories .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 14]: We continued our talk with the planters , branching from subject to subject .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 30]: But at last the word `` circumstance , '' casually dropped , in the course of conversation , attracted his attention and brought an eager look into his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 12]: He faced about in his chair and said : `` Circumstance ?
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 3]: What circumstance ?
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 10]: Ah , I know -- I know too well .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 9]: So you have heard of it too . ''
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 6]: -LSB- With a sigh . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 14]: `` Well , no matter -- all the world has heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 4]: All the world .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 4]: The whole world .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 22]: It is a large world , too , for a thing to travel so far in -- now is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 30]: Yes , yes -- the Greeley correspondence with Erickson has created the saddest and bitterest controversy on both sides of the ocean -- and still they keep it up !
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 12]: It makes us famous , but at what a sorrowful sacrifice !
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 21]: I was so sorry when I heard that it had caused that bloody and distressful war over there in Italy .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 27]: It was little comfort to me , after so much bloodshed , to know that the victors sided with me , and the vanquished with Greeley .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 22]: -- It is little comfort to know that Horace Greeley is responsible for the battle of Sadowa , and not me .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 49]: `` Queen Victoria wrote me that she felt just as I did about it -- she said that as much as she was opposed to Greeley and the spirit he showed in the correspondence with me , she would not have had Sadowa happen for hundreds of dollars .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 15]: I can show you her letter , if you would like to see it .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 31]: But gentlemen , much as you may think you know about that unhappy correspondence , you can not know the straight of it till you hear it from my lips .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 14]: It has always been garbled in the journals , and even in history .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 10]: Yes , even in history -- think of it !
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 17]: Let me -- please let me , give you the matter , exactly as it occurred .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 9]: I truly will not abuse your confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 71]: Then he leaned forward , all interest , all earnestness , and told his story -- and told it appealingly , too , and yet in the simplest and most unpretentious way ; indeed , in such a way as to suggest to one , all the time , that this was a faithful , honorable witness , giving evidence in the sacred interest of justice , and under oath .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 52]: He said : `` Mrs. Beazeley -- Mrs. Jackson Beazeley , widow , of the village of Campbellton , Kansas , -- wrote me about a matter which was near her heart -- a matter which many might think trivial , but to her it was a thing of deep concern .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 13]: I was living in Michigan , then -- serving in the ministry .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 28]: She was , and is , an estimable woman -- a woman to whom poverty and hardship have proven incentives to industry , in place of discouragements .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 25]: Her only treasure was her son William , a youth just verging upon manhood ; religious , amiable , and sincerely attached to agriculture .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 10]: He was the widow 's comfort and her pride .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 37]: And so , moved by her love for him , she wrote me about a matter , as I have said before , which lay near her heart -- because it lay near her boy 's .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 11]: She desired me to confer with Mr. Greeley about turnips .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 11]: Turnips were the dream of her child 's young ambition .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 36]: While other youths were frittering away in frivolous amusements the precious years of budding vigor which God had given them for useful preparation , this boy was patiently enriching his mind with information concerning turnips .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 13]: The sentiment which he felt toward the turnip was akin to adoration .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 26]: He could not think of the turnip without emotion ; he could not speak of it calmly ; he could not contemplate it without exaltation .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 9]: He could not eat it without shedding tears .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 15]: All the poetry in his sensitive nature was in sympathy with the gracious vegetable .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 35]: With the earliest pipe of dawn he sought his patch , and when the curtaining night drove him from it he shut himself up with his books and garnered statistics till sleep overcame him .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 15]: On rainy days he sat and talked hours together with his mother about turnips .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 31]: When company came , he made it his loving duty to put aside everything else and converse with them all the day long of his great joy in the turnip .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 11]: `` And yet , was this joy rounded and complete ?
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 10]: Was there no secret alloy of unhappiness in it ?
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 5]: Alas , there was .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 32]: There was a canker gnawing at his heart ; the noblest inspiration of his soul eluded his endeavor -- viz : he could not make of the turnip a climbing vine .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 30]: Months went by ; the bloom forsook his cheek , the fire faded out of his eye ; sighings and abstraction usurped the place of smiles and cheerful converse .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 17]: But a watchful eye noted these things and in time a motherly sympathy unsealed the secret .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 6]: Hence the letter to me .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 14]: She pleaded for attention -- she said her boy was dying by inches .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 14]: `` I was a stranger to Mr. Greeley , but what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 5]: The matter was urgent .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 19]: I wrote and begged him to solve the difficult problem if possible and save the student 's life .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 14]: My interest grew , until it partook of the anxiety of the mother .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 6]: I waited in much suspense .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 7]: -- At last the answer came .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 22]: `` I found that I could not read it readily , the handwriting being unfamiliar and my emotions somewhat wrought up .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 82]: It seemed to refer in part to the boy 's case , but chiefly to other and irrelevant matters -- such as paving-stones , electricity , oysters , and something which I took to be ` absolution ' or ` agrarianism , ' I could not be certain which ; still , these appeared to be simply casual mentions , nothing more ; friendly in spirit , without doubt , but lacking the connection or coherence necessary to make them useful .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 21]: -- I judged that my understanding was affected by my feelings , and so laid the letter away till morning .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 30]: `` In the morning I read it again , but with difficulty and uncertainty still , for I had lost some little rest and my mental vision seemed clouded .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 20]: The note was more connected , now , but did not meet the emergency it was expected to meet .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 5]: It was too discursive .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 31]: It appeared to read as follows , though I was not certain of some of the words : `` Polygamy dissembles majesty ; extracts redeem polarity ; causes hitherto exist .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 10]: Ovations pursue wisdom , or warts inherit and condemn .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 14]: Boston , botany , cakes , folony undertakes , but who shall allay ?
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 4]: We fear not .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 6]: Yrxwly , HEVACE EVEELOJ . '
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 13]: `` But there did not seem to be a word about turnips .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 18]: There seemed to be no suggestion as to how they might be made to grow like vines .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 10]: There was not even a reference to the Beazeleys .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 17]: I slept upon the matter ; I ate no supper , neither any breakfast next morning .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 15]: So I resumed my work with a brain refreshed , and was very hopeful .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 24]: Now the letter took a different aspect-all save the signature , which latter I judged to be only a harmless affectation of Hebrew .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 28]: The epistle was necessarily from Mr. Greeley , for it bore the printed heading of The Tribune , and I had written to no one else there .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 23]: The letter , I say , had taken a different aspect , but still its language was eccentric and avoided the issue .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 21]: It now appeared to say : `` Bolivia extemporizes mackerel ; borax esteems polygamy ; sausages wither in the east .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 13]: Creation perdu , is done ; for woes inherent one can damn .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 13]: Buttons , buttons , corks , geology underrates but we shall allay .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 5]: My beer 's out .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 6]: Yrxwly , HEVACE EVEELOJ . '
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 6]: `` I was evidently overworked .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 5]: My comprehension was impaired .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 17]: Therefore I gave two days to recreation , and then returned to my task greatly refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 23]: The letter now took this form : `` Poultices do sometimes choke swine ; tulips reduce posterity ; causes leather to resist .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 13]: Our notions empower wisdom , her let 's afford while we can .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 17]: Butter but any cakes , fill any undertaker , we 'll wean him from his filly .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 4]: We feel hot .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 6]: Yrxwly , HEVACE EVEELOJ . '
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 7]: `` I was still not satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 8]: These generalities did not meet the question .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 43]: They were crisp , and vigorous , and delivered with a confidence that almost compelled conviction ; but at such a time as this , with a human life at stake , they seemed inappropriate , worldly , and in bad taste .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 66]: At any other time I would have been not only glad , but proud , to receive from a man like Mr. Greeley a letter of this kind , and would have studied it earnestly and tried to improve myself all I could ; but now , with that poor boy in his far home languishing for relief , I had no heart for learning .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 13]: `` Three days passed by , and I read the note again .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 6]: Again its tenor had changed .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 22]: It now appeared to say : `` Potations do sometimes wake wines ; turnips restrain passion ; causes necessary to state .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 13]: Infest the poor widow ; her lord 's effects will be void .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 23]: But dirt , bathing , etc. , etc. , followed unfairly , will worm him from his folly -- so swear not .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 6]: Yrxwly , HEVACE EVEELOJ . '
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 7]: `` This was more like it .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 7]: But I was unable to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 6]: I was too much worn .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 54]: The word ` turnips ' brought temporary joy and encouragement , but my strength was so much impaired , and the delay might be so perilous for the boy , that I relinquished the idea of pursuing the translation further , and resolved to do what I ought to have done at first .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 25]: I sat down and wrote Mr. Greeley as follows : `` DEAR SIR : I fear I do not entirely comprehend your kind note .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 46]: It can not be possible , Sir , that ` turnips restrain passion ' -- at least the study or contemplation of turnips can not -- for it is this very employment that has scorched our poor friend 's mind and sapped his bodily strength .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 24]: -- But if they do restrain it , will you bear with us a little further and explain how they should be prepared ?
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 20]: I observe that you say 'cause s necessary to state , ' but you have omitted to state them .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 25]: `` Under a misapprehension , you seem to attribute to me interested motives in this matter -- to call it by no harsher term .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 30]: But I assure you , dear sir , that if I seem to be ` infesting the widow , ' it is all seeming , and void of reality .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 14]: It is from no seeking of mine that I am in this position .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 10]: She asked me , herself , to write you .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 12]: I never have infested her -- indeed I scarcely know her .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 6]: I do not infest anybody .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 29]: I try to go along , in my humble way , doing as near right as I can , never harming anybody , and never throwing out insinuations .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 18]: As for ` her lord and his effects , ' they are of no interest to me .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 39]: I trust I have effects enough of my own -- shall endeavor to get along with them , at any rate , and not go mousing around to get hold of somebody 's that are ` void . '
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 6]: But do you not see ?
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 14]: -- this woman is a widow -- she has no ` lord . '
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 14]: He is dead -- or pretended to be , when they buried him .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 43]: Therefore , no amount of ` dirt , bathing , ' etc. , etc. , howsoever ` unfairly followed ' will be likely to ` worm him from his folly ' -- if being dead and a ghost is ` folly . '
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 34]: Your closing remark is as unkind as it was uncalled for ; and if report says true you might have applied it to yourself , sir , with more point and less impropriety .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 7]: Very Truly Yours , SIMON ERICKSON .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 37]: `` In the course of a few days , Mr. Greely did what would have saved a world of trouble , and much mental and bodily suffering and misunderstanding , if he had done it sooner .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 24]: To wit , he sent an intelligible rescript or translation of his original note , made in a plain hand by his clerk .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 19]: Then the mystery cleared , and I saw that his heart had been right , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 14]: I will recite the note in its clarified form : -LSB- Translation . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 16]: ` Potatoes do sometimes make vines ; turnips remain passive : cause unnecessary to state .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 12]: Inform the poor widow her lad 's efforts will be vain .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 7]: But diet , bathing , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 16]: etc. , followed uniformly , will wean him from his folly -- so fear not .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 6]: Yours , HORACE GREELEY . '
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 14]: `` But alas , it was too late , gentlemen -- too late .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 14]: The criminal delay had done its work -- young Beazely was no more .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 25]: His spirit had taken its flight to a land where all anxieties shall be charmed away , all desires gratified , all ambitions realized .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 17]: Poor lad , they laid him to his rest with a turnip in each hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 15]: So ended Erickson , and lapsed again into nodding , mumbling , and abstraction .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 20]: The company broke up , and left him so ... But they did not say what drove him crazy .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 10]: In the momentary confusion , I forgot to ask .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXI .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 28]: At four o'clock in the afternoon we were winding down a mountain of dreary and desolate lava to the sea , and closing our pleasant land journey .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 32]: This lava is the accumulation of ages ; one torrent of fire after another has rolled down here in old times , and built up the island structure higher and higher .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 42]: Underneath , it is honey-combed with caves ; it would be of no use to dig wells in such a place ; they would not hold water -- you would not find any for them to hold , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 8]: Consequently , the planters depend upon cisterns .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 19]: The last lava flow occurred here so long ago that there are none now living who witnessed it .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 83]: In one place it enclosed and burned down a grove of cocoa-nut trees , and the holes in the lava where the trunks stood are still visible ; their sides retain the impression of the bark ; the trees fell upon the burning river , and becoming partly submerged , left in it the perfect counterpart of every knot and branch and leaf , and even nut , for curiosity seekers of a long distant day to gaze upon and wonder at .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 36]: There were doubtless plenty of Kanaka sentinels on guard hereabouts at that time , but they did not leave casts of their figures in the lava as the Roman sentinels at Herculaneum and Pompeii did .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 20]: It is a pity it is so , because such things are so interesting ; but so it is .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 5]: They probably went away .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 7]: They went away early , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 22]: However , they had their merits ; the Romans exhibited the higher pluck , but the Kanakas showed the sounder judgment .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 46]: Shortly we came in sight of that spot whose history is so familiar to every school-boy in the wide world -- Kealakekua Bay -- the place where Captain Cook , the great circumnavigator , was killed by the natives , nearly a hundred years ago .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 23]: The setting sun was flaming upon it , a Summer shower was falling , and it was spanned by two magnificent rainbows .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 27]: Two men who were in advance of us rode through one of these and for a moment their garments shone with a more than regal splendor .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 17]: Why did not Captain Cook have taste enough to call his great discovery the Rainbow Islands ?
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 66]: These charming spectacles are present to you at every turn ; they are common in all the islands ; they are visible every day , and frequently at night also -- not the silvery bow we see once in an age in the States , by moonlight , but barred with all bright and beautiful colors , like the children of the sun and rain .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 10]: I saw one of them a few nights ago .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 29]: What the sailors call `` raindogs '' -- little patches of rainbow -- are often seen drifting about the heavens in these latitudes , like stained cathedral windows .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 32]: Kealakekua Bay is a little curve like the last kink of a snail-shell , winding deep into the land , seemingly not more than a mile wide from shore to shore .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 66]: It is bounded on one side -- where the murder was done -- by a little flat plain , on which stands a cocoanut grove and some ruined houses ; a steep wall of lava , a thousand feet high at the upper end and three or four hundred at the lower , comes down from the mountain and bounds the inner extremity of it .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 25]: From this wall the place takes its name , Kealakekua , which in the native tongue signifies `` The Pathway of the Gods . ''
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 53]: They say , -LRB- and still believe , in spite of their liberal education in Christianity -RRB- , that the great god Lono , who used to live upon the hillside , always traveled that causeway when urgent business connected with heavenly affairs called him down to the seashore in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 117]: As the red sun looked across the placid ocean through the tall , clean stems of the cocoanut trees , like a blooming whiskey bloat through the bars of a city prison , I went and stood in the edge of the water on the flat rock pressed by Captain Cook 's feet when the blow was dealt which took away his life , and tried to picture in my mind the doomed man struggling in the midst of the multitude of exasperated savages -- the men in the ship crowding to the vessel 's side and gazing in anxious dismay toward the shore -- the -- but I discovered that I could not do it .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 67]: It was growing dark , the rain began to fall , we could see that the distant Boomerang was helplessly becalmed at sea , and so I adjourned to the cheerless little box of a warehouse and sat down to smoke and think , and wish the ship would make the land -- for we had not eaten much for ten hours and were viciously hungry .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 22]: Plain unvarnished history takes the romance out of Captain Cook 's assassination , and renders a deliberate verdict of justifiable homicide .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 28]: Wherever he went among the islands , he was cordially received and welcomed by the inhabitants , and his ships lavishly supplied with all manner of food .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 9]: He returned these kindnesses with insult and ill-treatment .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 68]: Perceiving that the people took him for the long vanished and lamented god Lono , he encouraged them in the delusion for the sake of the limitless power it gave him ; but during the famous disturbance at this spot , and while he and his comrades were surrounded by fifteen thousand maddened savages , he received a hurt and betrayed his earthly origin with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 5]: It was his death-warrant .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 10]: Instantly a shout went up : `` He groans !
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 8]: -- he is not a god ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 10]: So they closed in upon him and dispatched him .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 24]: His flesh was stripped from the bones and burned -LRB- except nine pounds of it which were sent on board the ships -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 30]: The heart was hung up in a native hut , where it was found and eaten by three children , who mistook it for the heart of a dog .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 21]: One of these children grew to be a very old man , and died in Honolulu a few years ago .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 19]: Some of Cook 's bones were recovered and consigned to the deep by the officers of the ships .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 13]: Small blame should attach to the natives for the killing of Cook .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 5]: They treated him well .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 7]: In return , he abused them .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 29]: He and his men inflicted bodily injury upon many of them at different times , and killed at least three of them before they offered any proportionate retaliation .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 29]: Near the shore we found `` Cook 's Monument '' -- only a cocoanut stump , four feet high and about a foot in diameter at the butt .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 48]: It had lava boulders piled around its base to hold it up and keep it in its place , and it was entirely sheathed over , from top to bottom , with rough , discolored sheets of copper , such as ships ' bottoms are coppered with .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 25]: Each sheet had a rude inscription scratched upon it -- with a nail , apparently -- and in every case the execution was wretched .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 45]: Most of these merely recorded the visits of British naval commanders to the spot , but one of them bore this legend : `` Near this spot fell CAPTAIN JAMES COOK , The Distinguished Circumnavigator , Who Discovered these Islands A. D. 1778 . ''
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 45]: After Cook 's murder , his second in command , on board the ship , opened fire upon the swarms of natives on the beach , and one of his cannon balls cut this cocoanut tree short off and left this monumental stump standing .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 16]: It looked sad and lonely enough to us , out there in the rainy twilight .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 10]: But there is no other monument to Captain Cook .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 74]: True , up on the mountain side we had passed by a large inclosure like an ample hog-pen , built of lava blocks , which marks the spot where Cook 's flesh was stripped from his bones and burned ; but this is not properly a monument since it was erected by the natives themselves , and less to do honor to the circumnavigator than for the sake of convenience in roasting him .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 51]: A thing like a guide-board was elevated above this pen on a tall pole , and formerly there was an inscription upon it describing the memorable occurrence that had there taken place ; but the sun and the wind have long ago so defaced it as to render it illegible .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 20]: Toward midnight a fine breeze sprang up and the schooner soon worked herself into the bay and cast anchor .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 21]: The boat came ashore for us , and in a little while the clouds and the rain were all gone .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 39]: The moon was beaming tranquilly down on land and sea , and we two were stretched upon the deck sleeping the refreshing sleep and dreaming the happy dreams that are only vouchsafed to the weary and the innocent .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXII .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 18]: In the breezy morning we went ashore and visited the ruined temple of the last god Lono .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 37]: The high chief cook of this temple -- the priest who presided over it and roasted the human sacrifices -- was uncle to Obookia , and at one time that youth was an apprentice-priest under him .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 53]: Obookia was a young native of fine mind , who , together with three other native boys , was taken to New England by the captain of a whaleship during the reign of Kamehameha I , and they were the means of attracting the attention of the religious world to their country .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 9]: This resulted in the sending of missionaries there .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 27]: And this Obookia was the very same sensitive savage who sat down on the church steps and wept because his people did not have the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 81]: That incident has been very elaborately painted in many a charming Sunday School book -- aye , and told so plaintively and so tenderly that I have cried over it in Sunday School myself , on general principles , although at a time when I did not know much and could not understand why the people of the Sandwich Islands needed to worry so much about it as long as they did not know there was a Bible at all .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 24]: Obookia was converted and educated , and was to have returned to his native land with the first missionaries , had he lived .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 56]: The other native youths made the voyage , and two of them did good service , but the third , William Kanui , fell from grace afterward , for a time , and when the gold excitement broke out in California he journeyed thither and went to mining , although he was fifty years old .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 47]: He succeeded pretty well , but the failure of Page , Bacon & Co. relieved him of six thousand dollars , and then , to all intents and purposes , he was a bankrupt in his old age and he resumed service in the pulpit again .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 7]: He died in Honolulu in 1864 .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 58]: Quite a broad tract of land near the temple , extending from the sea to the mountain top , was sacred to the god Lono in olden times -- so sacred that if a common native set his sacrilegious foot upon it it was judicious for him to make his will , because his time had come .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 15]: He might go around it by water , but he could not cross it .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 21]: It was well sprinkled with pagan temples and stocked with awkward , homely idols carved out of logs of wood .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 48]: There was a temple devoted to prayers for rain -- and with fine sagacity it was placed at a point so well up on the mountain side that if you prayed there twenty-four times a day for rain you would be likely to get it every time .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 16]: You would seldom get to your Amen before you would have to hoist your umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 35]: And there was a large temple near at hand which was built in a single night , in the midst of storm and thunder and rain , by the ghastly hands of dead men !
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 61]: Tradition says that by the weird glare of the lightning a noiseless multitude of phantoms were seen at their strange labor far up the mountain side at dead of night -- flitting hither and thither and bearing great lava-blocks clasped in their nerveless fingers -- appearing and disappearing as the pallid lustre fell upon their forms and faded away again .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 30]: Even to this day , it is said , the natives hold this dread structure in awe and reverence , and will not pass by it in the night .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 31]: At noon I observed a bevy of nude native young ladies bathing in the sea , and went and sat down on their clothes to keep them from being stolen .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 23]: I begged them to come out , for the sea was rising and I was satisfied that they were running some risk .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 14]: But they were not afraid , and presently went on with their sport .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 15]: They were finished swimmers and divers , and enjoyed themselves to the last degree .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 21]: They swam races , splashed and ducked and tumbled each other about , and filled the air with their laughter .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 28]: It is said that the first thing an Islander learns is how to swim ; learning to walk being a matter of smaller consequence , comes afterward .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 31]: One hears tales of native men and women swimming ashore from vessels many miles at sea -- more miles , indeed , than I dare vouch for or even mention .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 21]: And they tell of a native diver who went down in thirty or forty-foot waters and brought up an anvil !
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 14]: I think he swallowed the anvil afterward , if my memory serves me .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 8]: However I will not urge this point .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 24]: I have spoken , several times , of the god Lono -- I may as well furnish two or three sentences concerning him .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 17]: The idol the natives worshipped for him was a slender , unornamented staff twelve feet long .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 51]: Tradition says he was a favorite god on the Island of Hawaii -- a great king who had been deified for meritorious services -- just our own fashion of rewarding heroes , with the difference that we would have made him a Postmaster instead of a god , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 15]: In an angry moment he slew his wife , a goddess named Kaikilani Aiii .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 45]: Remorse of conscience drove him mad , and tradition presents us the singular spectacle of a god traveling `` on the shoulder ; '' for in his gnawing grief he wandered about from place to place boxing and wrestling with all whom he met .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 40]: Of course this pastime soon lost its novelty , inasmuch as it must necessarily have been the case that when so powerful a deity sent a frail human opponent `` to grass '' he never came back any more .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 46]: Therefore , he instituted games called makahiki , and ordered that they should be held in his honor , and then sailed for foreign lands on a three-cornered raft , stating that he would return some day -- and that was the last of Lono .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 14]: He was never seen any more ; his raft got swamped , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 23]: But the people always expected his return , and thus they were easily led to accept Captain Cook as the restored god .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 36]: Some of the old natives believed Cook was Lono to the day of their death ; but many did not , for they could not understand how he could die if he was a god .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 26]: Only a mile or so from Kealakekua Bay is a spot of historic interest -- the place where the last battle was fought for idolatry .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 31]: Of course we visited it , and came away as wise as most people do who go and gaze upon such mementoes of the past when in an unreflective mood .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 33]: While the first missionaries were on their way around the Horn , the idolatrous customs which had obtained in the island , as far back as tradition reached were suddenly broken up .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 36]: Old Kamehameha I. , was dead , and his son , Liholiho , the new King was a free liver , a roystering , dissolute fellow , and hated the restraints of the ancient tabu .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 41]: His assistant in the Government , Kaahumanu , the Queen dowager , was proud and high-spirited , and hated the tabu because it restricted the privileges of her sex and degraded all women very nearly to the level of brutes .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 5]: So the case stood .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 29]: Liholiho had half a mind to put his foot down , Kaahumahu had a whole mind to badger him into doing it , and whiskey did the rest .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 6]: It was probably the rest .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 16]: It was probably the first time whiskey ever prominently figured as an aid to civilization .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 53]: Liholiho came up to Kailua as drunk as a piper , and attended a great feast ; the determined Queen spurred his drunken courage up to a reckless pitch , and then , while all the multitude stared in blank dismay , he moved deliberately forward and sat down with the women !
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 15]: They saw him eat from the same vessel with them , and were appalled !
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 26]: Terrible moments drifted slowly by , and still the King ate , still he lived , still the lightnings of the insulted gods were withheld !
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 34]: Then conviction came like a revelation -- the superstitions of a hundred generations passed from before the people like a cloud , and a shout went up , `` the tabu is broken !
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 6]: the tabu is broken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 31]: Thus did King Liholiho and his dreadful whiskey preach the first sermon and prepare the way for the new gospel that was speeding southward over the waves of the Atlantic .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 120]: The tabu broken and destruction failing to follow the awful sacrilege , the people , with that childlike precipitancy which has always characterized them , jumped to the conclusion that their gods were a weak and wretched swindle , just as they formerly jumped to the conclusion that Captain Cook was no god , merely because he groaned , and promptly killed him without stopping to inquire whether a god might not groan as well as a man if it suited his convenience to do it ; and satisfied that the idols were powerless to protect themselves they went to work at once and pulled them down -- hacked them to pieces -- applied the torch -- annihilated them !
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 6]: The pagan priests were furious .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 40]: And well they might be ; they had held the fattest offices in the land , and now they were beggared ; they had been great -- they had stood above the chiefs -- and now they were vagabonds .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 33]: They raised a revolt ; they scared a number of people into joining their standard , and Bekuokalani , an ambitious offshoot of royalty , was easily persuaded to become their leader .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 26]: In the first skirmish the idolaters triumphed over the royal army sent against them , and full of confidence they resolved to march upon Kailua .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 39]: The King sent an envoy to try and conciliate them , and came very near being an envoy short by the operation ; the savages not only refused to listen to him , but wanted to kill him .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 19]: So the King sent his men forth under Major General Kalaimoku and the two host met a Kuamoo .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 48]: The battle was long and fierce -- men and women fighting side by side , as was the custom -- and when the day was done the rebels were flying in every direction in hopeless panic , and idolatry and the tabu were dead in the land !
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 12]: The royalists marched gayly home to Kailua glorifying the new dispensation .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 22]: `` There is no power in the gods , '' said they ; `` they are a vanity and a lie .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 17]: The army with idols was weak ; the army without idols was strong and victorious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 7]: The nation was without a religion .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 29]: The missionary ship arrived in safety shortly afterward , timed by providential exactness to meet the emergency , and the Gospel was planted as in a virgin soil .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 40]: At noon , we hired a Kanaka to take us down to the ancient ruins at Honaunan in his canoe -- price two dollars -- reasonable enough , for a sea voyage of eight miles , counting both ways .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 9]: The native canoe is an irresponsible looking contrivance .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 29]: I can not think of anything to liken it to but a boy 's sled runner hollowed out , and that does not quite convey the correct idea .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 45]: It is about fifteen feet long , high and pointed at both ends , is a foot and a half or two feet deep , and so narrow that if you wedged a fat man into it you might not get him out again .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 27]: It sits on top of the water like a duck , but it has an outrigger and does not upset easily , if you keep still .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 81]: This outrigger is formed of two long bent sticks like plow handles , which project from one side , and to their outer ends is bound a curved beam composed of an extremely light wood , which skims along the surface of the water and thus saves you from an upset on that side , while the outrigger 's weight is not so easily lifted as to make an upset on the other side a thing to be greatly feared .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 40]: Still , until one gets used to sitting perched upon this knifeblade , he is apt to reason within himself that it would be more comfortable if there were just an outrigger or so on the other side also .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 27]: I had the bow seat , and Billings sat amidships and faced the Kanaka , who occupied the stern of the craft and did the paddling .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 19]: With the first stroke the trim shell of a thing shot out from the shore like an arrow .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 7]: There was not much to see .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 36]: While we were on the shallow water of the reef , it was pastime to look down into the limpid depths at the large bunches of branching coral -- the unique shrubbery of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 19]: We lost that , though , when we got out into the dead blue water of the deep .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 27]: But we had the picture of the surf , then , dashing angrily against the crag-bound shore and sending a foaming spray high into the air .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 43]: There was interest in this beetling border , too , for it was honey-combed with quaint caves and arches and tunnels , and had a rude semblance of the dilapidated architecture of ruined keeps and castles rising out of the restless sea .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 51]: When this novelty ceased to be a novelty , we turned our eyes shoreward and gazed at the long mountain with its rich green forests stretching up into the curtaining clouds , and at the specks of houses in the rearward distance and the diminished schooner riding sleepily at anchor .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 57]: And when these grew tiresome we dashed boldly into the midst of a school of huge , beastly porpoises engaged at their eternal game of arching over a wave and disappearing , and then doing it over again and keeping it up -- always circling over , in that way , like so many well-submerged wheels .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 17]: But the porpoises wheeled themselves away , and then we were thrown upon our own resources .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 27]: It did not take many minutes to discover that the sun was blazing like a bonfire , and that the weather was of a melting temperature .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 8]: It had a drowsing effect , too .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 29]: In one place we came upon a large company of naked natives , of both sexes and all ages , amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 67]: Each heathen would paddle three or four hundred yards out to sea , -LRB- taking a short board with him -RRB- , then face the shore and wait for a particularly prodigious billow to come along ; at the right moment he would fling his board upon its foamy crest and himself upon the board , and here he would come whizzing by like a bombshell !
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 18]: It did not seem that a lightning express train could shoot along at a more hair-lifting speed .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 14]: I tried surf-bathing once , subsequently , but made a failure of it .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 21]: I got the board placed right , and at the right moment , too ; but missed the connection myself .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 37]: -- The board struck the shore in three quarters of a second , without any cargo , and I struck the bottom about the same time , with a couple of barrels of water in me .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 11]: None but natives ever master the art of surf-bathing thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 43]: At the end of an hour , we had made the four miles , and landed on a level point of land , upon which was a wide extent of old ruins , with many a tall cocoanut tree growing among them .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 48]: Here was the ancient City of Refuge -- a vast inclosure , whose stone walls were twenty feet thick at the base , and fifteen feet high ; an oblong square , a thousand and forty feet one way and a fraction under seven hundred the other .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 30]: Within this inclosure , in early times , has been three rude temples ; each two hundred and ten feet long by one hundred wide , and thirteen high .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 71]: In those days , if a man killed another anywhere on the island the relatives were privileged to take the murderer 's life ; and then a chase for life and liberty began -- the outlawed criminal flying through pathless forests and over mountain and plain , with his hopes fixed upon the protecting walls of the City of Refuge , and the avenger of blood following hotly after him !
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 72]: Sometimes the race was kept up to the very gates of the temple , and the panting pair sped through long files of excited natives , who watched the contest with flashing eye and dilated nostril , encouraging the hunted refugee with sharp , inspiriting ejaculations , and sending up a ringing shout of exultation when the saving gates closed upon him and the cheated pursuer sank exhausted at the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 45]: But sometimes the flying criminal fell under the hand of the avenger at the very door , when one more brave stride , one more brief second of time would have brought his feet upon the sacred ground and barred him against all harm .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 19]: Where did these isolated pagans get this idea of a City of Refuge -- this ancient Oriental custom ?
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 17]: This old sanctuary was sacred to all -- even to rebels in arms and invading armies .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 43]: Once within its walls , and confession made to the priest and absolution obtained , the wretch with a price upon his head could go forth without fear and without danger -- he was tabu , and to harm him was death .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 23]: The routed rebels in the lost battle for idolatry fled to this place to claim sanctuary , and many were thus saved .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 33]: Close to the corner of the great inclosure is a round structure of stone , some six or eight feet high , with a level top about ten or twelve in diameter .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 7]: This was the place of execution .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 16]: A high palisade of cocoanut piles shut out the cruel scenes from the vulgar multitude .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 27]: Here criminals were killed , the flesh stripped from the bones and burned , and the bones secreted in holes in the body of the structure .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 17]: If the man had been guilty of a high crime , the entire corpse was burned .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 9]: The walls of the temple are a study .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 36]: The same food for speculation that is offered the visitor to the Pyramids of Egypt he will find here -- the mystery of how they were constructed by a people unacquainted with science and mechanics .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 35]: The natives have no invention of their own for hoisting heavy weights , they had no beasts of burden , and they have never even shown any knowledge of the properties of the lever .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 39]: Yet some of the lava blocks quarried out , brought over rough , broken ground , and built into this wall , six or seven feet from the ground , are of prodigious size and would weigh tons .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 9]: How did they transport and how raise them ?
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 21]: Both the inner and outer surfaces of the walls present a smooth front and are very creditable specimens of masonry .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 21]: The blocks are of all manner of shapes and sizes , but yet are fitted together with the neatest exactness .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 14]: The gradual narrowing of the wall from the base upward is accurately preserved .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 23]: No cement was used , but the edifice is firm and compact and is capable of resisting storm and decay for centuries .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 22]: Who built this temple , and how was it built , and when , are mysteries that may never be unraveled .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 60]: Outside of these ancient walls lies a sort of coffin-shaped stone eleven feet four inches long and three feet square at the small end -LRB- it would weigh a few thousand pounds -RRB- , which the high chief who held sway over this district many centuries ago brought thither on his shoulder one day to use as a lounge !
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 10]: This circumstance is established by the most reliable traditions .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 35]: He used to lie down on it , in his indolent way , and keep an eye on his subjects at work for him and see that there was no `` soldiering '' done .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 35]: And no doubt there was not any done to speak of , because he was a man of that sort of build that incites to attention to business on the part of an employee .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 8]: He was fourteen or fifteen feet high .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 28]: When he stretched himself at full length on his lounge , his legs hung down over the end , and when he snored he woke the dead .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 9]: These facts are all attested by irrefragable tradition .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 25]: On the other side of the temple is a monstrous seven-ton rock , eleven feet long , seven feet wide and three feet thick .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 25]: It is raised a foot or a foot and a half above the ground , and rests upon half a dozen little stony pedestals .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 58]: The same old fourteen-footer brought it down from the mountain , merely for fun -LRB- he had his own notions about fun -RRB- , and propped it up as we find it now and as others may find it a century hence , for it would take a score of horses to budge it from its position .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 42]: They say that fifty or sixty years ago the proud Queen Kaahumanu used to fly to this rock for safety , whenever she had been making trouble with her fierce husband , and hide under it until his wrath was appeased .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 58]: But these Kanakas will lie , and this statement is one of their ablest efforts -- for Kaahumanu was six feet high -- she was bulky -- she was built like an ox -- and she could no more have squeezed herself under that rock than she could have passed between the cylinders of a sugar mill .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 12]: What could she gain by it , even if she succeeded ?
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 39]: To be chased and abused by a savage husband could not be otherwise than humiliating to her high spirit , yet it could never make her feel so flat as an hour 's repose under that rock would .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 32]: We walked a mile over a raised macadamized road of uniform width ; a road paved with flat stones and exhibiting in its every detail a considerable degree of engineering skill .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 40]: Some say that that wise old pagan , Kamehameha I planned and built it , but others say it was built so long before his time that the knowledge of who constructed it has passed out of the traditions .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 23]: In either case , however , as the handiwork of an untaught and degraded race it is a thing of pleasing interest .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 36]: The stones are worn and smooth , and pushed apart in places , so that the road has the exact appearance of those ancient paved highways leading out of Rome which one sees in pictures .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 25]: The object of our tramp was to visit a great natural curiosity at the base of the foothills -- a congealed cascade of lava .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 38]: Some old forgotten volcanic eruption sent its broad river of fire down the mountain side here , and it poured down in a great torrent from an overhanging bluff some fifty feet high to the ground below .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 27]: The flaming torrent cooled in the winds from the sea , and remains there to-day , all seamed , and frothed and rippled a petrified Niagara .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 18]: It is very picturesque , and withal so natural that one might almost imagine it still flowed .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 41]: A smaller stream trickled over the cliff and built up an isolated pyramid about thirty feet high , which has the semblance of a mass of large gnarled and knotted vines and roots and stems intricately twisted and woven together .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 29]: We passed in behind the cascade and the pyramid , and found the bluff pierced by several cavernous tunnels , whose crooked courses we followed a long distance .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 14]: Two of these winding tunnels stand as proof of Nature 's mining abilities .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 18]: Their floors are level , they are seven feet wide , and their roofs are gently arched .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 8]: Their height is not uniform , however .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 39]: We passed through one a hundred feet long , which leads through a spur of the hill and opens out well up in the sheer wall of a precipice whose foot rests in the waves of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 22]: It is a commodious tunnel , except that there are occasional places in it where one must stoop to pass under .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 26]: The roof is lava , of course , and is thickly studded with little lava-pointed icicles an inch long , which hardened as they dripped .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 36]: They project as closely together as the iron teeth of a corn-sheller , and if one will stand up straight and walk any distance there , he can get his hair combed free of charge .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 28]: We got back to the schooner in good time , and then sailed down to Kau , where we disembarked and took final leave of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 24]: Next day we bought horses and bent our way over the summer-clad mountain-terraces , toward the great volcano of Kilauea -LRB- Ke-low-way-ah -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 19]: We made nearly a two days ' journey of it , but that was on account of laziness .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 91]: Toward sunset on the second day , we reached an elevation of some four thousand feet above sea level , and as we picked our careful way through billowy wastes of lava long generations ago stricken dead and cold in the climax of its tossing fury , we began to come upon signs of the near presence of the volcano -- signs in the nature of ragged fissures that discharged jets of sulphurous vapor into the air , hot from the molten ocean down in the bowels of the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 7]: Shortly the crater came into view .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 25]: I have seen Vesuvius since , but it was a mere toy , a child 's volcano , a soup-kettle , compared to this .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 47]: Mount Vesuvius is a shapely cone thirty-six hundred feet high ; its crater an inverted cone only three hundred feet deep , and not more than a thousand feet in diameter , if as much as that ; its fires meagre , modest , and docile .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 33]: -- But here was a vast , perpendicular , walled cellar , nine hundred feet deep in some places , thirteen hundred in others , level-floored , and ten miles in circumference !
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 21]: Here was a yawning pit upon whose floor the armies of Russia could camp , and have room to spare .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 28]: Perched upon the edge of the crater , at the opposite end from where we stood , was a small look-out house -- say three miles away .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 32]: It assisted us , by comparison , to comprehend and appreciate the great depth of the basin -- it looked like a tiny martin-box clinging at the eaves of a cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 19]: After some little time spent in resting and looking and ciphering , we hurried on to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 16]: By the path it is half a mile from the Volcano House to the lookout-house .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 18]: After a hearty supper we waited until it was thoroughly dark and then started to the crater .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 13]: The first glance in that direction revealed a scene of wild beauty .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 21]: There was a heavy fog over the crater and it was splendidly illuminated by the glare from the fires below .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 61]: The illumination was two miles wide and a mile high , perhaps ; and if you ever , on a dark night and at a distance beheld the light from thirty or forty blocks of distant buildings all on fire at once , reflected strongly against over-hanging clouds , you can form a fair idea of what this looked like .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 50]: A colossal column of cloud towered to a great height in the air immediately above the crater , and the outer swell of every one of its vast folds was dyed with a rich crimson luster , which was subdued to a pale rose tint in the depressions between .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 17]: It glowed like a muffled torch and stretched upward to a dizzy height toward the zenith .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 42]: I thought it just possible that its like had not been seen since the children of Israel wandered on their long march through the desert so many centuries ago over a path illuminated by the mysterious `` pillar of fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 30]: And I was sure that I now had a vivid conception of what the majestic `` pillar of fire '' was like , which almost amounted to a revelation .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 37]: Arrived at the little thatched lookout house , we rested our elbows on the railing in front and looked abroad over the wide crater and down over the sheer precipice at the seething fires beneath us .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 11]: The view was a startling improvement on my daylight experience .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 24]: I turned to see the effect on the balance of the company and found the reddest-faced set of men I almost ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 26]: In the strong light every countenance glowed like red-hot iron , every shoulder was suffused with crimson and shaded rearward into dingy , shapeless obscurity !
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 21]: The place below looked like the infernal regions and these men like half-cooled devils just come up on a furlough .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 9]: I turned my eyes upon the volcano again .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 10]: The `` cellar '' was tolerably well lighted up .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 74]: For a mile and a half in front of us and half a mile on either side , the floor of the abyss was magnificently illuminated ; beyond these limits the mists hung down their gauzy curtains and cast a deceptive gloom over all that made the twinkling fires in the remote corners of the crater seem countless leagues removed -- made them seem like the camp-fires of a great army far away .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 9]: Here was room for the imagination to work !
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 49]: You could imagine those lights the width of a continent away -- and that hidden under the intervening darkness were hills , and winding rivers , and weary wastes of plain and desert -- and even then the tremendous vista stretched on , and on , and on !
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 8]: -- to the fires and far beyond !
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 28]: You could not compass it -- it was the idea of eternity made tangible -- and the longest end of it made visible to the naked eye !
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 49]: The greater part of the vast floor of the desert under us was as black as ink , and apparently smooth and level ; but over a mile square of it was ringed and streaked and striped with a thousand branching streams of liquid and gorgeously brilliant fire !
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 21]: It looked like a colossal railroad map of the State of Massachusetts done in chain lightning on a midnight sky .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 16]: Imagine it -- imagine a coal-black sky shivered into a tangled net-work of angry fire !
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 97]: Here and there were gleaming holes a hundred feet in diameter , broken in the dark crust , and in them the melted lava -- the color a dazzling white just tinged with yellow -- was boiling and surging furiously ; and from these holes branched numberless bright torrents in many directions , like the spokes of a wheel , and kept a tolerably straight course for a while and then swept round in huge rainbow curves , or made a long succession of sharp worm-fence angles , which looked precisely like the fiercest jagged lightning .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 30]: These streams met other streams , and they mingled with and crossed and recrossed each other in every conceivable direction , like skate tracks on a popular skating ground .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 63]: Sometimes streams twenty or thirty feet wide flowed from the holes to some distance without dividing -- and through the opera-glasses we could see that they ran down small , steep hills and were genuine cataracts of fire , white at their source , but soon cooling and turning to the richest red , grained with alternate lines of black and gold .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 23]: Every now and then masses of the dark crust broke away and floated slowly down these streams like rafts down a river .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 70]: Occasionally the molten lava flowing under the superincumbent crust broke through -- split a dazzling streak , from five hundred to a thousand feet long , like a sudden flash of lightning , and then acre after acre of the cold lava parted into fragments , turned up edgewise like cakes of ice when a great river breaks up , plunged downward and were swallowed in the crimson cauldron .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 27]: Then the wide expanse of the `` thaw '' maintained a ruddy glow for a while , but shortly cooled and became black and level again .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 76]: During a `` thaw , '' every dismembered cake was marked by a glittering white border which was superbly shaded inward by aurora borealis rays , which were a flaming yellow where they joined the white border , and from thence toward their points tapered into glowing crimson , then into a rich , pale carmine , and finally into a faint blush that held its own a moment and then dimmed and turned black .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 52]: Some of the streams preferred to mingle together in a tangle of fantastic circles , and then they looked something like the confusion of ropes one sees on a ship 's deck when she has just taken in sail and dropped anchor -- provided one can imagine those ropes on fire .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 13]: Through the glasses , the little fountains scattered about looked very beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 57]: They boiled , and coughed , and spluttered , and discharged sprays of stringy red fire -- of about the consistency of mush , for instance -- from ten to fifteen feet into the air , along with a shower of brilliant white sparks -- a quaint and unnatural mingling of gouts of blood and snow-flakes !
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 97]: We had circles and serpents and streaks of lightning all twined and wreathed and tied together , without a break throughout an area more than a mile square -LRB- that amount of ground was covered , though it was not strictly `` square '' -RRB- , and it was with a feeling of placid exultation that we reflected that many years had elapsed since any visitor had seen such a splendid display -- since any visitor had seen anything more than the now snubbed and insignificant `` North '' and `` South '' lakes in action .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 24]: We had been reading old files of Hawaiian newspapers and the `` Record Book '' at the Volcano House , and were posted .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 33]: I could see the North Lake lying out on the black floor away off in the outer edge of our panorama , and knitted to it by a web-work of lava streams .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 16]: In its individual capacity it looked very little more respectable than a schoolhouse on fire .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 39]: True , it was about nine hundred feet long and two or three hundred wide , but then , under the present circumstances , it necessarily appeared rather insignificant , and besides it was so distant from us .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 26]: I forgot to say that the noise made by the bubbling lava is not great , heard as we heard it from our lofty perch .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 80]: It makes three distinct sounds -- a rushing , a hissing , and a coughing or puffing sound ; and if you stand on the brink and close your eyes it is no trick at all to imagine that you are sweeping down a river on a large low-pressure steamer , and that you hear the hissing of the steam about her boilers , the puffing from her escape-pipes and the churning rush of the water abaft her wheels .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 14]: The smell of sulphur is strong , but not unpleasant to a sinner .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 41]: We left the lookout house at ten o'clock in a half cooked condition , because of the heat from Pele 's furnaces , and wrapping up in blankets , for the night was cold , we returned to our Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXV .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 44]: The next night was appointed for a visit to the bottom of the crater , for we desired to traverse its floor and see the `` North Lake '' -LRB- of fire -RRB- which lay two miles away , toward the further wall .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 40]: After dark half a dozen of us set out , with lanterns and native guides , and climbed down a crazy , thousand-foot pathway in a crevice fractured in the crater wall , and reached the bottom in safety .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 50]: The irruption of the previous evening had spent its force and the floor looked black and cold ; but when we ran out upon it we found it hot yet , to the feet , and it was likewise riven with crevices which revealed the underlying fires gleaming vindictively .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 18]: A neighboring cauldron was threatening to overflow , and this added to the dubiousness of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 21]: So the native guides refused to continue the venture , and then every body deserted except a stranger named Marlette .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 25]: He said he had been in the crater a dozen times in daylight and believed he could find his way through it at night .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 25]: He thought that a run of three hundred yards would carry us over the hottest part of the floor and leave us our shoe-soles .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 6]: His pluck gave me back-bone .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 49]: We took one lantern and instructed the guides to hang the other to the roof of the look-out house to serve as a beacon for us in case we got lost , and then the party started back up the precipice and Marlette and I made our run .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 26]: We skipped over the hot floor and over the red crevices with brisk dispatch and reached the cold lava safe but with pretty warm feet .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 28]: Then we took things leisurely and comfortably , jumping tolerably wide and probably bottomless chasms , and threading our way through picturesque lava upheavals with considerable confidence .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 39]: When we got fairly away from the cauldrons of boiling fire , we seemed to be in a gloomy desert , and a suffocatingly dark one , surrounded by dim walls that seemed to tower to the sky .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 11]: The only cheerful objects were the glinting stars high overhead .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 9]: By and by Marlette shouted `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 8]: I never stopped quicker in my life .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 7]: I asked what the matter was .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 9]: He said we were out of the path .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 37]: He said we must not try to go on till we found it again , for we were surrounded with beds of rotten lava through which we could easily break and plunge down a thousand feet .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 31]: I thought eight hundred would answer for me , and was about to say so when Marlette partly proved his statement by accidentally crushing through and disappearing to his arm-pits .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 13]: He got out and we hunted for the path with the lantern .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 15]: He said there was only one path and that it was but vaguely defined .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 6]: We could not find it .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 11]: The lava surface was all alike in the lantern light .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 7]: But he was an ingenious man .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 23]: He said it was not the lantern that had informed him that we were out of the path , but his feet .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 28]: He had noticed a crisp grinding of fine lava-needles under his feet , and some instinct reminded him that in the path these were all worn away .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 20]: So he put the lantern behind him , and began to search with his boots instead of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 5]: It was good sagacity .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 44]: The first time his foot touched a surface that did not grind under it he announced that the trail was found again ; and after that we kept up a sharp listening for the rasping sound and it always warned us in time .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 11]: It was a long tramp , but an exciting one .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 24]: We reached the North Lake between ten and eleven o'clock , and sat down on a huge overhanging lava-shelf , tired but satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 12]: The spectacle presented was worth coming double the distance to see .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 21]: Under us , and stretching away before us , was a heaving sea of molten fire of seemingly limitless extent .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 22]: The glare from it was so blinding that it was some time before we could bear to look upon it steadily .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 20]: It was like gazing at the sun at noon-day , except that the glare was not quite so white .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 64]: At unequal distances all around the shores of the lake were nearly white-hot chimneys or hollow drums of lava , four or five feet high , and up through them were bursting gorgeous sprays of lava-gouts and gem spangles , some white , some red and some golden -- a ceaseless bombardment , and one that fascinated the eye with its unapproachable splendor .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 38]: The mere distant jets , sparkling up through an intervening gossamer veil of vapor , seemed miles away ; and the further the curving ranks of fiery fountains receded , the more fairy-like and beautiful they appeared .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 93]: Now and then the surging bosom of the lake under our noses would calm down ominously and seem to be gathering strength for an enterprise ; and then all of a sudden a red dome of lava of the bulk of an ordinary dwelling would heave itself aloft like an escaping balloon , then burst asunder , and out of its heart would flit a pale-green film of vapor , and float upward and vanish in the darkness -- a released soul soaring homeward from captivity with the damned , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 30]: The crashing plunge of the ruined dome into the lake again would send a world of seething billows lashing against the shores and shaking the foundations of our perch .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 42]: By and by , a loosened mass of the hanging shelf we sat on tumbled into the lake , jarring the surroundings like an earthquake and delivering a suggestion that may have been intended for a hint , and may not .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 7]: We did not wait to see .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 20]: We got lost again on our way back , and were more than an hour hunting for the path .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 30]: We were where we could see the beacon lantern at the look-out house at the time , but thought it was a star and paid no attention to it .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 15]: We reached the hotel at two o'clock in the morning pretty well fagged out .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 30]: Kilauea never overflows its vast crater , but bursts a passage for its lava through the mountain side when relief is necessary , and then the destruction is fearful .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 38]: About 1840 it rent its overburdened stomach and sent a broad river of fire careering down to the sea , which swept away forests , huts , plantations and every thing else that lay in its path .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 25]: The stream was five miles broad , in places , and two hundred feet deep , and the distance it traveled was forty miles .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 22]: It tore up and bore away acre-patches of land on its bosom like rafts -- rocks , trees and all intact .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 28]: At night the red glare was visible a hundred miles at sea ; and at a distance of forty miles fine print could be read at midnight .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 100]: The atmosphere was poisoned with sulphurous vapors and choked with falling ashes , pumice stones and cinders ; countless columns of smoke rose up and blended together in a tumbled canopy that hid the heavens and glowed with a ruddy flush reflected from the fires below ; here and there jets of lava sprung hundreds of feet into the air and burst into rocket-sprays that returned to earth in a crimson rain ; and all the while the laboring mountain shook with Nature 's great palsy and voiced its distress in moanings and the muffled booming of subterranean thunders .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 17]: Fishes were killed for twenty miles along the shore , where the lava entered the sea .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 29]: The earthquakes caused some loss of human life , and a prodigious tidal wave swept inland , carrying every thing before it and drowning a number of natives .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 17]: The devastation consummated along the route traversed by the river of lava was complete and incalculable .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 22]: Only a Pompeii and a Herculaneum were needed at the foot of Kilauea to make the story of the irruption immortal .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 28]: We rode horseback all around the island of Hawaii -LRB- the crooked road making the distance two hundred miles -RRB- , and enjoyed the journey very much .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 53]: We were more than a week making the trip , because our Kanaka horses would not go by a house or a hut without stopping -- whip and spur could not alter their minds about it , and so we finally found that it economized time to let them have their way .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 57]: Upon inquiry the mystery was explained : the natives are such thorough-going gossips that they never pass a house without stopping to swap news , and consequently their horses learn to regard that sort of thing as an essential part of the whole duty of man , and his salvation not to be compassed without it .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 64]: However , at a former crisis of my life I had once taken an aristocratic young lady out driving , behind a horse that had just retired from a long and honorable career as the moving impulse of a milk wagon , and so this present experience awoke a reminiscent sadness in me in place of the exasperation more natural to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 293]: I remembered how helpless I was that day , and how humiliated ; how ashamed I was of having intimated to the girl that I had always owned the horse and was accustomed to grandeur ; how hard I tried to appear easy , and even vivacious , under suffering that was consuming my vitals ; how placidly and maliciously the girl smiled , and kept on smiling , while my hot blushes baked themselves into a permanent blood-pudding in my face ; how the horse ambled from one side of the street to the other and waited complacently before every third house two minutes and a quarter while I belabored his back and reviled him in my heart ; how I tried to keep him from turning corners and failed ; how I moved heaven and earth to get him out of town , and did not succeed ; how he traversed the entire settlement and delivered imaginary milk at a hundred and sixty-two different domiciles , and how he finally brought up at a dairy depot and refused to budge further , thus rounding and completing the revealment of what the plebeian service of his life had been ; how , in eloquent silence , I walked the girl home , and how , when I took leave of her , her parting remark scorched my soul and appeared to blister me all over : she said that my horse was a fine , capable animal , and I must have taken great comfort in him in my time -- but that if I would take along some milk-tickets next time , and appear to deliver them at the various halting places , it might expedite his movements a little .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 9]: There was a coolness between us after that .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 47]: In one place in the island of Hawaii , we saw a laced and ruffled cataract of limpid water leaping from a sheer precipice fifteen hundred feet high ; but that sort of scenery finds its stanchest ally in the arithmetic rather than in spectacular effect .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 66]: If one desires to be so stirred by a poem of Nature wrought in the happily commingled graces of picturesque rocks , glimpsed distances , foliage , color , shifting lights and shadows , and failing water , that the tears almost come into his eyes so potent is the charm exerted , he need not go away from America to enjoy such an experience .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 20]: The Rainbow Fall , in Watkins Glen -LRB- N.Y. -RRB- , on the Erie railway , is an example .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 57]: It would recede into pitiable insignificance if the callous tourist drew on arithmetic on it ; but left to compete for the honors simply on scenic grace and beauty -- the grand , the august and the sublime being barred the contest -- it could challenge the old world and the new to produce its peer .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 59]: In one locality , on our journey , we saw some horses that had been born and reared on top of the mountains , above the range of running water , and consequently they had never drank that fluid in their lives , but had been always accustomed to quenching their thirst by eating dew-laden or shower-wetted leaves .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 41]: And now it was destructively funny to see them sniff suspiciously at a pail of water , and then put in their noses and try to take a bite out of the fluid , as if it were a solid .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 23]: Finding it liquid , they would snatch away their heads and fall to trembling , snorting and showing other evidences of fright .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 38]: When they became convinced at last that the water was friendly and harmless , they thrust in their noses up to their eyes , brought out a mouthful of water , and proceeded to chew it complacently .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 26]: We saw a man coax , kick and spur one of them five or ten minutes before he could make it cross a running stream .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 39]: It spread its nostrils , distended its eyes and trembled all over , just as horses customarily do in the presence of a serpent -- and for aught I know it thought the crawling stream was a serpent .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 50]: In due course of time our journey came to an end at Kawaehae -LRB- usually pronounced To-a-hi -- and before we find fault with this elaborate orthographical method of arriving at such an unostentatious result , let us lop off the ugh from our word `` though '' -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 9]: I made this horseback trip on a mule .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 33]: I paid ten dollars for him at Kau -LRB- Kah-oo -RRB- , added four to get him shod , rode him two hundred miles , and then sold him for fifteen dollars .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 70]: I mark the circumstance with a white stone -LRB- in the absence of chalk -- for I never saw a white stone that a body could mark anything with , though out of respect for the ancients I have tried it often enough -RRB- ; for up to that day and date it was the first strictly commercial transaction I had ever entered into , and come out winner .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 23]: We returned to Honolulu , and from thence sailed to the island of Maui , and spent several weeks there very pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 25]: I still remember , with a sense of indolent luxury , a picnicing excursion up a romantic gorge there , called the Iao Valley .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 34]: The trail lay along the edge of a brawling stream in the bottom of the gorge -- a shady route , for it was well roofed with the verdant domes of forest trees .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 23]: Through openings in the foliage we glimpsed picturesque scenery that revealed ceaseless changes and new charms with every step of our progress .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 32]: Perpendicular walls from one to three thousand feet high guarded the way , and were sumptuously plumed with varied foliage , in places , and in places swathed in waving ferns .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 99]: Passing shreds of cloud trailed their shadows across these shining fronts , mottling them with blots ; billowy masses of white vapor hid the turreted summits , and far above the vapor swelled a background of gleaming green crags and cones that came and went , through the veiling mists , like islands drifting in a fog ; sometimes the cloudy curtain descended till half the canon wall was hidden , then shredded gradually away till only airy glimpses of the ferny front appeared through it -- then swept aloft and left it glorified in the sun again .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 55]: Now and then , as our position changed , rocky bastions swung out from the wall , a mimic ruin of castellated ramparts and crumbling towers clothed with mosses and hung with garlands of swaying vines , and as we moved on they swung back again and hid themselves once more in the foliage .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 29]: Presently a verdure-clad needle of stone , a thousand feet high , stepped out from behind a corner , and mounted guard over the mysteries of the valley .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 36]: It seemed to me that if Captain Cook needed a monument , here was one ready made -- therefore , why not put up his sign here , and sell out the venerable cocoanut stump ?
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 26]: But the chief pride of Maui is her dead volcano of Haleakala -- which means , translated , `` the house of the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 49]: We climbed a thousand feet up the side of this isolated colossus one afternoon ; then camped , and next day climbed the remaining nine thousand feet , and anchored on the summit , where we built a fire and froze and roasted by turns , all night .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 18]: With the first pallor of dawn we got up and saw things that were new to us .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 14]: Mounted on a commanding pinnacle , we watched Nature work her silent wonders .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 21]: The sea was spread abroad on every hand , its tumbled surface seeming only wrinkled and dimpled in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 30]: A broad valley below appeared like an ample checker-board , its velvety green sugar plantations alternating with dun squares of barrenness and groves of trees diminished to mossy tufts .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 28]: Beyond the valley were mountains picturesquely grouped together ; but bear in mind , we fancied that we were looking up at these things -- not down .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 31]: We seemed to sit in the bottom of a symmetrical bowl ten thousand feet deep , with the valley and the skirting sea lifted away into the sky above us !
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 39]: It was curious ; and not only curious , but aggravating ; for it was having our trouble all for nothing , to climb ten thousand feet toward heaven and then have to look up at our scenery .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 34]: However , we had to be content with it and make the best of it ; for , all we could do we could not coax our landscape down out of the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 39]: Formerly , when I had read an article in which Poe treated of this singular fraud perpetrated upon the eye by isolated great altitudes , I had looked upon the matter as an invention of his own fancy .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 17]: I have spoken of the outside view -- but we had an inside one , too .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 106]: That was the yawning dead crater , into which we now and then tumbled rocks , half as large as a barrel , from our perch , and saw them go careering down the almost perpendicular sides , bounding three hundred feet at a jump ; kicking up cast-clouds wherever they struck ; diminishing to our view as they sped farther into distance ; growing invisible , finally , and only betraying their course by faint little puffs of dust ; and coming to a halt at last in the bottom of the abyss , two thousand five hundred feet down from where they started !
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 5]: It was magnificent sport .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 7]: We wore ourselves out at it .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 39]: The crater of Vesuvius , as I have before remarked , is a modest pit about a thousand feet deep and three thousand in circumference ; that of Kilauea is somewhat deeper , and ten miles in circumference .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 14]: But what are either of them compared to the vacant stomach of Haleakala ?
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 35]: I will not offer any figures of my own , but give official ones -- those of Commander Wilkes , U.S.N. , who surveyed it and testifies that it is twenty-seven miles in circumference !
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 18]: If it had a level bottom it would make a fine site for a city like London .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 22]: It must have afforded a spectacle worth contemplating in the old days when its furnaces gave full rein to their anger .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 130]: Presently vagrant white clouds came drifting along , high over the sea and the valley ; then they came in couples and groups ; then in imposing squadrons ; gradually joining their forces , they banked themselves solidly together , a thousand feet under us , and totally shut out land and ocean -- not a vestige of anything was left in view but just a little of the rim of the crater , circling away from the pinnacle whereon we sat -LRB- for a ghostly procession of wanderers from the filmy hosts without had drifted through a chasm in the crater wall and filed round and round , and gathered and sunk and blended together till the abyss was stored to the brim with a fleecy fog -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 10]: Thus banked , motion ceased , and silence reigned .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 70]: Clear to the horizon , league on league , the snowy floor stretched without a break -- not level , but in rounded folds , with shallow creases between , and with here and there stately piles of vapory architecture lifting themselves aloft out of the common plain -- some near at hand , some in the middle distances , and others relieving the monotony of the remote solitudes .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 12]: There was little conversation , for the impressive scene overawed speech .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 26]: I felt like the Last Man , neglected of the judgment , and left pinnacled in mid-heaven , a forgotten relic of a vanished world .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 17]: While the hush yet brooded , the messengers of the coming resurrection appeared in the East .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 61]: A growing warmth suffused the horizon , and soon the sun emerged and looked out over the cloud-waste , flinging bars of ruddy light across it , staining its folds and billow-caps with blushes , purpling the shaded troughs between , and glorifying the massy vapor-palaces and cathedrals with a wasteful splendor of all blendings and combinations of rich coloring .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 22]: It was the sublimest spectacle I ever witnessed , and I think the memory of it will remain with me always .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXVII .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 12]: I stumbled upon one curious character in the Island of Mani .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 13]: He became a sore annoyance to me in the course of time .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 18]: My first glimpse of him was in a sort of public room in the town of Lahaina .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 47]: He occupied a chair at the opposite side of the apartment , and sat eyeing our party with interest for some minutes , and listening as critically to what we were saying as if he fancied we were talking to him and expecting him to reply .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 9]: I thought it very sociable in a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 49]: Presently , in the course of conversation , I made a statement bearing upon the subject under discussion -- and I made it with due modesty , for there was nothing extraordinary about it , and it was only put forth in illustration of a point at issue .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 47]: I had barely finished when this person spoke out with rapid utterance and feverish anxiety : `` Oh , that was certainly remarkable , after a fashion , but you ought to have seen my chimney -- you ought to have seen my chimney , sir !
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 2]: Smoke !
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 21]: I wish I may hang if -- Mr. Jones , you remember that chimney -- you must remember that chimney !
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 21]: No , no -- I recollect , now , you war n't living on this side of the island then .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 45]: But I am telling you nothing but the truth , and I wish I may never draw another breath if that chimney did n't smoke so that the smoke actually got caked in it and I had to dig it out with a pickaxe !
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 40]: You may smile , gentlemen , but the High Sheriff 's got a hunk of it which I dug out before his eyes , and so it 's perfectly easy for you to go and examine for yourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 37]: The interruption broke up the conversation , which had already begun to lag , and we presently hired some natives and an out-rigger canoe or two , and went out to overlook a grand surf-bathing contest .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 42]: Two weeks after this , while talking in a company , I looked up and detected this same man boring through and through me with his intense eye , and noted again his twitching muscles and his feverish anxiety to speak .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 34]: The moment I paused , he said : `` Beg your pardon , sir , beg your pardon , but it can only be considered remarkable when brought into strong outline by isolation .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 18]: Sir , contrasted with a circumstance which occurred in my own experience , it instantly becomes commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 94]: No , not that -- for I will not speak so discourteously of any experience in the career of a stranger and a gentleman -- but I am obliged to say that you could not , and you would not ever again refer to this tree as a large one , if you could behold , as I have , the great Yakmatack tree , in the island of Ounaska , sea of Kamtchatka -- a tree , sir , not one inch less than four hundred and fifteen feet in solid diameter !
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 16]: -- and I wish I may die in a minute if it is n't so !
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 29]: Oh , you need n't look so questioning , gentlemen ; here 's old Cap Saltmarsh can say whether I know what I 'm talking about or not .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 7]: I showed him the tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 20]: Captain Saltmarsh -- `` Come , now , cat your anchor , lad -- you 're heaving too taut .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 58]: You promised to show me that stunner , and I walked more than eleven mile with you through the cussedest jungle I ever see , a hunting for it ; but the tree you showed me finally war n't as big around as a beer cask , and you know that your own self , Markiss . ''
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 6]: `` Hear the man talk !
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 16]: Of course the tree was reduced that way , but did n't I explain it ?
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 7]: Answer me , did n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 17]: Did n't I say I wished you could have seen it when I first saw it ?
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 52]: When you got up on your ear and called me names , and said I had brought you eleven miles to look at a sapling , did n't I explain to you that all the whale-ships in the North Seas had been wooding off of it for more than twenty-seven years ?
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 15]: And did you s ` pose the tree could last for-ever , con-found it ?
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 29]: I do n't see why you want to keep back things that way , and try to injure a person that 's never done you any harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 58]: Somehow this man 's presence made me uncomfortable , and I was glad when a native arrived at that moment to say that Muckawow , the most companionable and luxurious among the rude war-chiefs of the Islands , desired us to come over and help him enjoy a missionary whom he had found trespassing on his grounds .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 80]: I think it was about ten days afterward that , as I finished a statement I was making for the instruction of a group of friends and acquaintances , and which made no pretence of being extraordinary , a familiar voice chimed instantly in on the heels of my last word , and said : `` But , my dear sir , there was nothing remarkable about that horse , or the circumstance either -- nothing in the world !
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 24]: I mean no sort of offence when I say it , sir , but you really do not know anything whatever about speed .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 19]: Bless your heart , if you could only have seen my mare Margaretta ; there was a beast !
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 7]: -- there was lightning for you !
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 2]: Trot !
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 10]: Trot is no name for it -- she flew !
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 8]: How she could whirl a buggy along !
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 48]: I started her out once , sir -- Colonel Bilgewater , you recollect that animal perfectly well -- I started her out about thirty or thirty-five yards ahead of the awfullest storm I ever saw in my life , and it chased us upwards of eighteen miles !
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 8]: It did , by the everlasting hills !
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 31]: And I 'm telling you nothing but the unvarnished truth when I say that not one single drop of rain fell on me -- not a single drop , sir !
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 6]: And I swear to it !
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 13]: But my dog was a-swimming behind the wagon all the way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 29]: For a week or two I stayed mostly within doors , for I seemed to meet this person everywhere , and he had become utterly hateful to me .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 20]: But one evening I dropped in on Captain Perkins and his friends , and we had a sociable time .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 38]: About ten o'clock I chanced to be talking about a merchant friend of mine , and without really intending it , the remark slipped out that he was a little mean and parsimonious about paying his workmen .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 56]: Instantly , through the steam of a hot whiskey punch on the opposite side of the room , a remembered voice shot -- and for a moment I trembled on the imminent verge of profanity : `` Oh , my dear sir , really you expose yourself when you parade that as a surprising circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 18]: Bless your heart and hide , you are ignorant of the very A B C of meanness !
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 6]: ignorant as the unborn babe !
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 5]: ignorant as unborn twins !
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 8]: You do n't know anything about it !
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 32]: It is pitiable to see you , sir , a well-spoken and prepossessing stranger , making such an enormous pow-wow here about a subject concerning which your ignorance is perfectly humiliating !
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 16]: Look me in the eye , if you please ; look me in the eye .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 28]: John James Godfrey was the son of poor but honest parents in the State of Mississippi -- boyhood friend of mine -- bosom comrade in later years .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 13]: Heaven rest his noble spirit , he is gone from us now .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 35]: John James Godfrey was hired by the Hayblossom Mining Company in California to do some blasting for them -- the `` Incorporated Company of Mean Men , '' the boys used to call it .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 54]: `` Well , one day he drilled a hole about four feet deep and put in an awful blast of powder , and was standing over it ramming it down with an iron crowbar about nine foot long , when the cussed thing struck a spark and fired the powder , and scat !
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 13]: away John Godfrey whizzed like a skyrocket , him and his crowbar !
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 79]: Well , sir , he kept on going up in the air higher and higher , till he did n't look any bigger than a boy -- and he kept going on up higher and higher , till he did n't look any bigger than a doll -- and he kept on going up higher and higher , till he did n't look any bigger than a little small bee -- and then he went out of sight !
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 106]: Presently he came in sight again , looking like a little small bee -- and he came along down further and further , till he looked as big as a doll again -- and down further and further , till he was as big as a boy again -- and further and further , till he was a full-sized man once more ; and then him and his crowbar came a wh-izzing down and lit right exactly in the same old tracks and went to r-ramming down , and r-ramming down , and r-ramming down again , just the same as if nothing had happened !
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 31]: Now do you know , that poor cuss war n't gone only sixteen minutes , and yet that Incorporated Company of Mean Men DOCKED HIM FOR THE LOST TIME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 15]: I said I had the headache , and so excused myself and went home .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 16]: And on my diary I entered `` another night spoiled '' by this offensive loafer .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 15]: And a fervent curse was set down with it to keep the item company .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 19]: And the very next day I packed up , out of all patience , and left the Island .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 14]: Almost from the very beginning , I regarded that man as a liar .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 10]: The line of points represents an interval of years .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 27]: At the end of which time the opinion hazarded in that last sentence came to be gratifyingly and remarkably endorsed , and by wholly disinterested persons .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 71]: The man Markiss was found one morning hanging to a beam of his own bedroom -LRB- the doors and windows securely fastened on the inside -RRB- , dead ; and on his breast was pinned a paper in his own handwriting begging his friends to suspect no innocent person of having any thing to do with his death , for that it was the work of his own hands entirely .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 26]: Yet the jury brought in the astounding verdict that deceased came to his death `` by the hands of some person or persons unknown ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 40]: They explained that the perfectly undeviating consistency of Markiss 's character for thirty years towered aloft as colossal and indestructible testimony , that whatever statement he chose to make was entitled to instant and unquestioning acceptance as a lie .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 44]: And they furthermore stated their belief that he was not dead , and instanced the strong circumstantial evidence of his own word that he was dead -- and beseeched the coroner to delay the funeral as long as possible , which was done .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 26]: And so in the tropical climate of Lahaina the coffin stood open for seven days , and then even the loyal jury gave him up .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 56]: But they sat on him again , and changed their verdict to `` suicide induced by mental aberration '' -- because , said they , with penetration , `` he said he was dead , and he was dead ; and would he have told the truth if he had been in his right mind ?
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 5]: No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 62]: After half a year 's luxurious vagrancy in the islands , I took shipping in a sailing vessel , and regretfully returned to San Francisco -- a voyage in every way delightful , but without an incident : unless lying two long weeks in a dead calm , eighteen hundred miles from the nearest land , may rank as an incident .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 42]: Schools of whales grew so tame that day after day they played about the ship among the porpoises and the sharks without the least apparent fear of us , and we pelted them with empty bottles for lack of better sport .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 33]: Twenty-four hours afterward these bottles would be still lying on the glassy water under our noses , showing that the ship had not moved out of her place in all that time .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 17]: The calm was absolutely breathless , and the surface of the sea absolutely without a wrinkle .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 59]: For a whole day and part of a night we lay so close to another ship that had drifted to our vicinity , that we carried on conversations with her passengers , introduced each other by name , and became pretty intimately acquainted with people we had never heard of before , and have never heard of since .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 13]: This was the only vessel we saw during the whole lonely voyage .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 91]: We had fifteen passengers , and to show how hard pressed they were at last for occupation and amusement , I will mention that the gentlemen gave a good part of their time every day , during the calm , to trying to sit on an empty champagne bottle -LRB- lying on its side -RRB- , and thread a needle without touching their heels to the deck , or falling over ; and the ladies sat in the shade of the mainsail , and watched the enterprise with absorbing interest .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 30]: We were at sea five Sundays ; and yet , but for the almanac , we never would have known but that all the other days were Sundays too .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 15]: I was home again , in San Francisco , without means and without employment .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 22]: I tortured my brain for a saving scheme of some kind , and at last a public lecture occurred to me !
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 14]: I sat down and wrote one , in a fever of hopeful anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 14]: I showed it to several friends , but they all shook their heads .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 19]: They said nobody would come to hear me , and I would make a humiliating failure of it .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 21]: They said that as I had never spoken in public , I would break down in the delivery , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 5]: I was disconsolate now .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 19]: But at last an editor slapped me on the back and told me to `` go ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 19]: He said , `` Take the largest house in town , and charge a dollar a ticket . ''
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 18]: The audacity of the proposition was charming ; it seemed fraught with practical worldly wisdom , however .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 26]: The proprietor of the several theatres endorsed the advice , and said I might have his handsome new opera-house at half price -- fifty dollars .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 14]: In sheer desperation I took it -- on credit , for sufficient reasons .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 30]: In three days I did a hundred and fifty dollars ' worth of printing and advertising , and was the most distressed and frightened creature on the Pacific coast .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 12]: I could not sleep -- who could , under such circumstances ?
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 34]: For other people there was facetiousness in the last line of my posters , but to me it was plaintive with a pang when I wrote it : `` Doors open at 7 1/2 .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 8]: The trouble will begin at 8 . ''
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 8]: That line has done good service since .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 6]: Showmen have borrowed it frequently .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 22]: I have even seen it appended to a newspaper advertisement reminding school pupils in vacation what time next term would begin .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 16]: As those three days of suspense dragged by , I grew more and more unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 19]: I had sold two hundred tickets among my personal friends , but I feared they might not come .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 52]: My lecture , which had seemed `` humorous '' to me , at first , grew steadily more and more dreary , till not a vestige of fun seemed left , and I grieved that I could not bring a coffin on the stage and turn the thing into a funeral .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 71]: I was so panic-stricken , at last , that I went to three old friends , giants in stature , cordial by nature , and stormy-voiced , and said : `` This thing is going to be a failure ; the jokes in it are so dim that nobody will ever see them ; I would like to have you sit in the parquette , and help me through . ''
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 5]: They said they would .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 51]: Then I went to the wife of a popular citizen , and said that if she was willing to do me a very great kindness , I would be glad if she and her husband would sit prominently in the left-hand stage-box , where the whole house could see them .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 49]: I explained that I should need help , and would turn toward her and smile , as a signal , when I had been delivered of an obscure joke -- `` and then , '' I added , `` do n't wait to investigate , but respond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 3]: She promised .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 13]: Down the street I met a man I never had seen before .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 14]: He had been drinking , and was beaming with smiles and good nature .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 9]: He said : `` My name 's Sawyer .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 12]: You do n't know me , but that do n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 25]: I have n't got a cent , but if you knew how bad I wanted to laugh , you 'd give me a ticket .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 10]: Come , now , what do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 9]: `` Is your laugh hung on a hair-trigger ?
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 17]: -- that is , is it critical , or can you get it off easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 57]: My drawling infirmity of speech so affected him that he laughed a specimen or two that struck me as being about the article I wanted , and I gave him a ticket , and appointed him to sit in the second circle , in the centre , and be responsible for that division of the house .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 29]: I gave him minute instructions about how to detect indistinct jokes , and then went away , and left him chuckling placidly over the novelty of the idea .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 16]: I ate nothing on the last of the three eventful days -- I only suffered .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 20]: I had advertised that on this third day the box-office would be opened for the sale of reserved seats .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 20]: I crept down to the theater at four in the afternoon to see if any sales had been made .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 12]: The ticket seller was gone , the box-office was locked up .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 14]: I had to swallow suddenly , or my heart would have got out .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 18]: `` No sales , '' I said to myself ; `` I might have known it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 10]: I thought of suicide , pretended illness , flight .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 16]: I thought of these things in earnest , for I was very miserable and scared .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 17]: But of course I had to drive them away , and prepare to meet my fate .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 32]: I could not wait for half-past seven -- I wanted to face the horror , and end it -- the feeling of many a man doomed to hang , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 18]: I went down back streets at six o'clock , and entered the theatre by the back door .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 20]: I stumbled my way in the dark among the ranks of canvas scenery , and stood on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 12]: The house was gloomy and silent , and its emptiness depressing .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 30]: I went into the dark among the scenes again , and for an hour and a half gave myself up to the horrors , wholly unconscious of everything else .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 22]: Then I heard a murmur ; it rose higher and higher , and ended in a crash , mingled with cheers .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 17]: It made my hair raise , it was so close to me , and so loud .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 66]: There was a pause , and then another ; presently came a third , and before I well knew what I was about , I was in the middle of the stage , staring at a sea of faces , bewildered by the fierce glare of the lights , and quaking in every limb with a terror that seemed like to take my life away .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 9]: The house was full , aisles and all !
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 22]: The tumult in my heart and brain and legs continued a full minute before I could gain any command over myself .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 41]: Then I recognized the charity and the friendliness in the faces before me , and little by little my fright melted away , and I began to talk Within three or four minutes I was comfortable , and even content .
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 43]: My three chief allies , with three auxiliaries , were on hand , in the parquette , all sitting together , all armed with bludgeons , and all ready to make an onslaught upon the feeblest joke that might show its head .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 22]: And whenever a joke did fall , their bludgeons came down and their faces seemed to split from ear to ear .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 28]: Sawyer , whose hearty countenance was seen looming redly in the centre of the second circle , took it up , and the house was carried handsomely .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 8]: Inferior jokes never fared so royally before .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 78]: Presently I delivered a bit of serious matter with impressive unction -LRB- it was my pet -RRB- , and the audience listened with an absorbed hush that gratified me more than any applause ; and as I dropped the last word of the clause , I happened to turn and catch Mrs. -- 's intent and waiting eye ; my conversation with her flashed upon me , and in spite of all I could do I smiled .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 32]: She took it for the signal , and promptly delivered a mellow laugh that touched off the whole audience ; and the explosion that followed was the triumph of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 22]: I thought that that honest man Sawyer would choke himself ; and as for the bludgeons , they performed like pile-drivers .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 10]: But my poor little morsel of pathos was ruined .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 28]: It was taken in good faith as an intentional joke , and the prize one of the entertainment , and I wisely let it go at that .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 20]: All the papers were kind in the morning ; my appetite returned ; I had a abundance of money .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 7]: All 's well that ends well .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXIX .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 13]: I launched out as a lecturer , now , with great boldness .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 21]: I had the field all to myself , for public lectures were almost an unknown commodity in the Pacific market .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 11]: They are not so rare , now , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 34]: I took an old personal friend along to play agent for me , and for two or three weeks we roamed through Nevada and California and had a very cheerful time of it .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 20]: Two days before I lectured in Virginia City , two stagecoaches were robbed within two miles of the town .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 38]: The daring act was committed just at dawn , by six masked men , who sprang up alongside the coaches , presented revolvers at the heads of the drivers and passengers , and commanded a general dismount .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 16]: Everybody climbed down , and the robbers took their watches and every cent they had .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 16]: Then they took gunpowder and blew up the express specie boxes and got their contents .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 31]: The leader of the robbers was a small , quick-spoken man , and the fame of his vigorous manner and his intrepidity was in everybody 's mouth when we arrived .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 24]: The night after instructing Virginia , I walked over the desolate `` divide '' and down to Gold Hill , and lectured there .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 20]: The lecture done , I stopped to talk with a friend , and did not start back till eleven .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 25]: The `` divide '' was high , unoccupied ground , between the towns , the scene of twenty midnight murders and a hundred robberies .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 32]: As we climbed up and stepped out on this eminence , the Gold Hill lights dropped out of sight at our backs , and the night closed down gloomy and dismal .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 16]: A sharp wind swept the place , too , and chilled our perspiring bodies through .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 19]: `` I tell you I do n't like this place at night , '' said Mike the agent .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 13]: `` Well , do n't speak so loud , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 12]: `` You need n't remind anybody that we are here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 18]: Just then a dim figure approached me from the direction of Virginia -- a man , evidently .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 25]: He came straight at me , and I stepped aside to let him pass ; he stepped in the way and confronted me again .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 29]: Then I saw that he had a mask on and was holding something in my face -- I heard a click-click and recognized a revolver in dim outline .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 16]: I pushed the barrel aside with my hand and said : `` Do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 8]: He ejaculated sharply : `` Your watch !
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 4]: Your money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 22]: I said : `` You can have them with pleasure -- but take the pistol away from my face , please .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 6]: It makes me shiver . ''
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 4]: `` No remarks !
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 6]: Hand out your money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 12]: `` Certainly -- I -- '' `` Put up your hands !
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 8]: Do n't you go for a weapon !
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 4]: Put 'em up !
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 3]: Higher ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 7]: I held them above my head .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 3]: A pause .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 15]: Then : `` Are you going to hand out your money or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 13]: I dropped my hands to my pockets and said : `` Certainly !
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 9]: I -- '' `` Put up your hands !
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 8]: Do you want your head blown off ?
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 3]: Higher ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 8]: I put them above my head again .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 3]: Another pause .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 12]: `` Are you going to hand out your money or not ?
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 4]: Ah-ah -- again ?
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 5]: Put up your hands !
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 14]: By George , you want the head shot off you awful bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 14]: `` Well , friend , I 'm trying my best to please you .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 24]: You tell me to give up my money , and when I reach for it you tell me to put up my hands .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 6]: If you would only -- .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 7]: Oh , now -- do n't !
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 7]: All six of you at me !
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 8]: That other man will get away while .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 19]: -- Now please take some of those revolvers out of my face -- do , if you please !
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 15]: Every time one of them clicks , my liver comes up into my throat !
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 34]: If you have a mother -- any of you -- or if any of you have ever had a mother -- or a -- grandmother -- or a -- '' `` Cheese it !
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 14]: Will you give up your money , or have we got to -- .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 8]: There -- there -- none of that !
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 6]: Put up your hands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 15]: `` Gentlemen -- I know you are gentlemen by your -- '' `` Silence !
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 18]: If you want to be facetious , young man , there are times and places more fitting .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 7]: This is a serious business . ''
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 9]: `` You prick the marrow of my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 14]: The funerals I have attended in my time were comedies compared to it .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 10]: Now I think -- '' `` Curse your palaver !
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 3]: Your money !
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 4]: -- your money !
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 4]: -- your money !
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 2]: Hold !
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 7]: -- put up your hands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 7]: `` Gentlemen , listen to reason .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 21]: You see how I am situated -- now do n't put those pistols so close -- I smell the powder .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 8]: `` You see how I am situated .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 20]: If I had four hands -- so that I could hold up two and -- '' `` Throttle him !
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 3]: Gag him !
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 4]: Kill him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 6]: `` Gentlemen , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 7]: Nobody 's watching the other fellow .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 8]: Why do n't some of you -- .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 2]: Ouch !
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 6]: Take it away , please !
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 71]: `` Gentlemen , you see that I 've got to hold up my hands ; and so I ca n't take out my money -- but if you 'll be so kind as to take it out for me , I will do as much for you some -- '' `` Search him Beauregard -- and stop his jaw with a bullet , quick , if he wags it again .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 6]: Help Beauregard , Stonewall . ''
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 21]: Then three of them , with the small , spry leader , adjourned to Mike and fell to searching him .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 46]: I was so excited that my lawless fancy tortured me to ask my two men all manner of facetious questions about their rebel brother-generals of the South , but , considering the order they had received , it was but common prudence to keep still .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 126]: When everything had been taken from me , -- watch , money , and a multitude of trifles of small value , -- I supposed I was free , and forthwith put my cold hands into my empty pockets and began an inoffensive jig to warm my feet and stir up some latent courage -- but instantly all pistols were at my head , and the order came again : They stood Mike up alongside of me , with strict orders to keep his hands above his head , too , and then the chief highwayman said : `` Beauregard , hide behind that boulder ; Phil Sheridan , you hide behind that other one ; Stonewall Jackson , put yourself behind that sage-bush there .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 31]: Keep your pistols bearing on these fellows , and if they take down their hands within ten minutes , or move a single peg , let them have it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 22]: Then three disappeared in the gloom toward the several ambushes , and the other three disappeared down the road toward Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 9]: It was depressingly still , and miserably cold .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 37]: Now this whole thing was a practical joke , and the robbers were personal friends of ours in disguise , and twenty more lay hidden within ten feet of us during the whole operation , listening .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 18]: Mike knew all this , and was in the joke , but I suspected nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 8]: To me it was most uncomfortably genuine .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 41]: When we had stood there in the middle of the road five minutes , like a couple of idiots , with our hands aloft , freezing to death by inches , Mike 's interest in the joke began to wane .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 15]: He said : `` The time 's up , now , aint it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 7]: `` No , you keep still .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 13]: Do you want to take any chances with these bloody savages ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 13]: Presently Mike said : `` Now the time 's up , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 5]: I 'm freezing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 4]: `` Well freeze .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 11]: Better freeze than carry your brains home in a basket .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 12]: Maybe the time is up , but how do we know ?
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 8]: -- got no watch to tell by .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 8]: I mean to give them good measure .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 10]: I calculate to stand here fifteen minutes or die .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 6]: Do n't you move . ''
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 17]: So , without knowing it , I was making one joker very sick of his contract .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 64]: When we took our arms down at last , they were aching with cold and fatigue , and when we went sneaking off , the dread I was in that the time might not yet be up and that we would feel bullets in a moment , was not sufficient to draw all my attention from the misery that racked my stiffened body .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 58]: The joke of these highwayman friends of ours was mainly a joke upon themselves ; for they had waited for me on the cold hill-top two full hours before I came , and there was very little fun in that ; they were so chilled that it took them a couple of weeks to get warm again .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 49]: Moreover , I never had a thought that they would kill me to get money which it was so perfectly easy to get without any such folly , and so they did not really frighten me bad enough to make their enjoyment worth the trouble they had taken .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 12]: I was only afraid that their weapons would go off accidentally .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 15]: Their very numbers inspired me with confidence that no blood would be intentionally spilled .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 34]: They were not smart ; they ought to have sent only one highwayman , with a double-barrelled shot gun , if they desired to see the author of this volume climb a tree .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 76]: However , I suppose that in the long run I got the largest share of the joke at last ; and in a shape not foreseen by the highwaymen ; for the chilly exposure on the `` divide '' while I was in a perspiration gave me a cold which developed itself into a troublesome disease and kept my hands idle some three months , besides costing me quite a sum in doctor 's bills .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 21]: Since then I play no practical jokes on people and generally lose my temper when one is played upon me .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 100]: When I returned to San Francisco I projected a pleasure journey to Japan and thence westward around the world ; but a desire to see home again changed my mind , and I took a berth in the steamship , bade good-bye to the friendliest land and livest , heartiest community on our continent , and came by the way of the Isthmus to New York -- a trip that was not much of a pic-nic excursion , for the cholera broke out among us on the passage and we buried two or three bodies at sea every day .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 65]: I found home a dreary place after my long absence ; for half the children I had known were now wearing whiskers or waterfalls , and few of the grown people I had been acquainted with remained at their hearthstones prosperous and happy -- some of them had wandered to other scenes , some were in jail , and the rest had been hanged .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 26]: These changes touched me deeply , and I went away and joined the famous Quaker City European Excursion and carried my tears to foreign lands .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 31]: Thus , after seven years of vicissitudes , ended a `` pleasure trip '' to the silver mines of Nevada which had originally been intended to occupy only three months .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 11]: However , I usually miss my calculations further than that .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 2]: MORAL .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 25]: If the reader thinks he is done , now , and that this book has no moral to it , he is in error .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 54]: The moral of it is this : If you are of any account , stay at home and make your way by faithful diligence ; but if you are `` no account , '' go away from home , and then you will have to work , whether you want to or not .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 28]: Thus you become a blessing to your friends by ceasing to be a nuisance to them -- if the people you go among suffer by the operation .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 2]: APPENDIX .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 7]: A. BRIEF SKETCH OF MORMON HISTORY .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 32]: Mormonism is only about forty years old , but its career has been full of stir and adventure from the beginning , and is likely to remain so to the end .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 38]: Its adherents have been hunted and hounded from one end of the country to the other , and the result is that for years they have hated all `` Gentiles '' indiscriminately and with all their might .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 36]: Joseph Smith , the finder of the Book of Mormon and founder of the religion , was driven from State to State with his mysterious copperplates and the miraculous stones he read their inscriptions with .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 15]: Finally he instituted his `` church '' in Ohio and Brigham Young joined it .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 10]: The neighbors began to persecute , and apostasy commenced .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 9]: Brigham held to the faith and worked hard .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 4]: He arrested desertion .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 14]: He did more -- he added converts in the midst of the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 10]: He rose in favor and importance with the brethren .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 12]: He was made one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 19]: He shortly fought his way to a higher post and a more powerful -- President of the Twelve .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 18]: The neighbors rose up and drove the Mormons out of Ohio , and they settled in Missouri .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 5]: Brigham went with them .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 13]: The Missourians drove them out and they retreated to Nauvoo , Illinois .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 43]: They prospered there , and built a temple which made some pretensions to architectural grace and achieved some celebrity in a section of country where a brick court-house with a tin dome and a cupola on it was contemplated with reverential awe .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 12]: But the Mormons were badgered and harried again by their neighbors .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 55]: All the proclamations Joseph Smith could issue denouncing polygamy and repudiating it as utterly anti-Mormon were of no avail ; the people of the neighborhood , on both sides of the Mississippi , claimed that polygamy was practised by the Mormons , and not only polygamy but a little of everything that was bad .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 29]: Brigham returned from a mission to England , where he had established a Mormon newspaper , and he brought back with him several hundred converts to his preaching .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 12]: His influence among the brethren augmented with every move he made .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 16]: Finally Nauvoo was invaded by the Missouri and Illinois Gentiles , and Joseph Smith killed .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 30]: A Mormon named Rigdon assumed the Presidency of the Mormon church and government , in Smith 's place , and even tried his hand at a prophecy or two .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 9]: But a greater than he was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 30]: Brigham seized the advantage of the hour and without other authority than superior brain and nerve and will , hurled Rigdon from his high place and occupied it himself .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 4]: He did more .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 53]: He launched an elaborate curse at Rigdon and his disciples ; and he pronounced Rigdon 's `` prophecies '' emanations from the devil , and ended by `` handing the false prophet over to the buffetings of Satan for a thousand years '' -- probably the longest term ever inflicted in Illinois .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 6]: The people recognized their master .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 27]: They straightway elected Brigham Young President , by a prodigious majority , and have never faltered in their devotion to him from that day to this .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 16]: Brigham had forecast -- a quality which no other prominent Mormon has probably ever possessed .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 15]: He recognized that it was better to move to the wilderness than be moved .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 62]: By his command the people gathered together their meagre effects , turned their backs upon their homes , and their faces toward the wilderness , and on a bitter night in February filed in sorrowful procession across the frozen Mississippi , lighted on their way by the glare from their burning temple , whose sacred furniture their own hands had fired !
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 51]: They camped , several days afterward , on the western verge of Iowa , and poverty , want , hunger , cold , sickness , grief and persecution did their work , and many succumbed and died -- martyrs , fair and true , whatever else they might have been .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 40]: Two years the remnant remained there , while Brigham and a small party crossed the country and founded Great Salt Lake City , purposely choosing a land which was outside the ownership and jurisdiction of the hated American nation .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 3]: Note that .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 5]: This was in 1847 .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 18]: Brigham moved his people there and got them settled just in time to see disaster fall again .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 18]: For the war closed and Mexico ceded Brigham 's refuge to the enemy -- the United States !
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 28]: In 1849 the Mormons organized a `` free and independent '' government and erected the `` State of Deseret , '' with Brigham Young as its head .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 40]: But the very next year Congress deliberately snubbed it and created the `` Territory of Utah '' out of the same accumulation of mountains , sage-brush , alkali and general desolation , -- but made Brigham Governor of it .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 32]: Then for years the enormous migration across the plains to California poured through the land of the Mormons and yet the church remained staunch and true to its lord and master .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 52]: Neither hunger , thirst , poverty , grief , hatred , contempt , nor persecution could drive the Mormons from their faith or their allegiance ; and even the thirst for gold , which gleaned the flower of the youth and strength of many nations was not able to entice them !
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 6]: That was the final test .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 16]: An experiment that could survive that was an experiment with some substance to it somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 12]: Great Salt Lake City throve finely , and so did Utah .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 52]: One of the last things which Brigham Young had done before leaving Iowa , was to appear in the pulpit dressed to personate the worshipped and lamented prophet Smith , and confer the prophetic succession , with all its dignities , emoluments and authorities , upon `` President Brigham Young ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 23]: The people accepted the pious fraud with the maddest enthusiasm , and Brigham 's power was sealed and secured for all time .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 50]: Within five years afterward he openly added polygamy to the tenets of the church by authority of a `` revelation '' which he pretended had been received nine years before by Joseph Smith , albeit Joseph is amply on record as denouncing polygamy to the day of his death .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 20]: Now was Brigham become a second Andrew Johnson in the small beginning and steady progress of his official grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 62]: He had served successively as a disciple in the ranks ; home missionary ; foreign missionary ; editor and publisher ; Apostle ; President of the Board of Apostles ; President of all Mormondom , civil and ecclesiastical ; successor to the great Joseph by the will of heaven ; `` prophet , '' `` seer , '' `` revelator . ''
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 27]: There was but one dignity higher which he could aspire to , and he reached out modestly and took that -- he proclaimed himself a God !
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 34]: He claims that he is to have a heaven of his own hereafter , and that he will be its God , and his wives and children its goddesses , princes and princesses .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 29]: Into it all faithful Mormons will be admitted , with their families , and will take rank and consequence according to the number of their wives and children .
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 59]: If a disciple dies before he has had time to accumulate enough wives and children to enable him to be respectable in the next world any friend can marry a few wives and raise a few children for him after he is dead , and they are duly credited to his account and his heavenly status advanced accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 88]: Let it be borne in mind that the majority of the Mormons have always been ignorant , simple , of an inferior order of intellect , unacquainted with the world and its ways ; and let it be borne in mind that the wives of these Mormons are necessarily after the same pattern and their children likely to be fit representatives of such a conjunction ; and then let it be remembered that for forty years these creatures have been driven , driven , driven , relentlessly !
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 78]: and mobbed , beaten , and shot down ; cursed , despised , expatriated ; banished to a remote desert , whither they journeyed gaunt with famine and disease , disturbing the ancient solitudes with their lamentations and marking the long way with graves of their dead -- and all because they were simply trying to live and worship God in the way which they believed with all their hearts and souls to be the true one .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 32]: Let all these things be borne in mind , and then it will not be hard to account for the deathless hatred which the Mormons bear our people and our government .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 27]: That hatred has `` fed fat its ancient grudge '' ever since Mormon Utah developed into a self-supporting realm and the church waxed rich and strong .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 14]: Brigham as Territorial Governor made it plain that Mormondom was for the Mormons .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 32]: The United States tried to rectify all that by appointing territorial officers from New England and other anti-Mormon localities , but Brigham prepared to make their entrance into his dominions difficult .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 18]: Three thousand United States troops had to go across the plains and put these gentlemen in office .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 16]: And after they were in office they were as helpless as so many stone images .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 13]: They made laws which nobody minded and which could not be executed .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 40]: The federal judges opened court in a land filled with crime and violence and sat as holiday spectacles for insolent crowds to gape at -- for there was nothing to try , nothing to do nothing on the dockets !
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 44]: And if a Gentile brought a suit , the Mormon jury would do just as it pleased about bringing in a verdict , and when the judgment of the court was rendered no Mormon cared for it and no officer could execute it .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 99]: Our Presidents shipped one cargo of officials after another to Utah , but the result was always the same -- they sat in a blight for awhile they fairly feasted on scowls and insults day by day , they saw every attempt to do their official duties find its reward in darker and darker looks , and in secret threats and warnings of a more and more dismal nature -- and at last they either succumbed and became despised tools and toys of the Mormons , or got scared and discomforted beyond all endurance and left the Territory .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 29]: If a brave officer kept on courageously till his pluck was proven , some pliant Buchanan or Pierce would remove him and appoint a stick in his place .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 13]: In 1857 General Harney came very near being appointed Governor of Utah .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 13]: And so it came very near being Harney governor and Cradlebaugh judge !
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 29]: -- two men who never had any idea of fear further than the sort of murky comprehension of it which they were enabled to gather from the dictionary .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 40]: Simply -LRB- if for nothing else -RRB- for the variety they would have made in a rather monotonous history of Federal servility and helplessness , it is a pity they were not fated to hold office together in Utah .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 17]: Up to the date of our visit to Utah , such had been the Territorial record .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 23]: The Territorial government established there had been a hopeless failure , and Brigham Young was the only real power in the land .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 64]: He was an absolute monarch -- a monarch who defied our President -- a monarch who laughed at our armies when they camped about his capital -- a monarch who received without emotion the news that the august Congress of the United States had enacted a solemn law against polygamy , and then went forth calmly and married twenty-five or thirty more wives .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 2]: B .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 5]: THE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 34]: The persecutions which the Mormons suffered so long -- and which they consider they still suffer in not being allowed to govern themselves -- they have endeavored and are still endeavoring to repay .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 13]: The now almost forgotten `` Mountain Meadows massacre '' was their work .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 8]: It was very famous in its day .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 9]: The whole United States rang with its horrors .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 10]: A few items will refresh the reader 's memory .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 33]: A great emigrant train from Missouri and Arkansas passed through Salt Lake City and a few disaffected Mormons joined it for the sake of the strong protection it afforded for their escape .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 14]: In that matter lay sufficient cause for hot retaliation by the Mormon chiefs .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 70]: Besides , these one hundred and forty-five or one hundred and fifty unsuspecting emigrants being in part from Arkansas , where a noted Mormon missionary had lately been killed , and in part from Missouri , a State remembered with execrations as a bitter persecutor of the saints when they were few and poor and friendless , here were substantial additional grounds for lack of love for these wayfarers .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 59]: And finally , this train was rich , very rich in cattle , horses , mules and other property -- and how could the Mormons consistently keep up their coveted resemblance to the Israelitish tribes and not seize the `` spoil '' of an enemy when the Lord had so manifestly `` delivered it into their hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 136]: Wherefore , according to Mrs. C. V. Waite 's entertaining book , `` The Mormon Prophet , '' it transpired that -- `` A ` revelation ' from Brigham Young , as Great Grand Archee or God , was dispatched to President J. C. Haight , Bishop Higbee and J. D. Lee -LRB- adopted son of Brigham -RRB- , commanding them to raise all the forces they could muster and trust , follow those cursed Gentiles -LRB- so read the revelation -RRB- , attack them disguised as Indians , and with the arrows of the Almighty make a clean sweep of them , and leave none to tell the tale ; and if they needed any assistance they were commanded to hire the Indians as their allies , promising them a share of the booty .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 38]: They were to be neither slothful nor negligent in their duty , and to be punctual in sending the teams back to him before winter set in , for this was the mandate of Almighty God . ''
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 11]: The command of the `` revelation '' was faithfully obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 34]: A large party of Mormons , painted and tricked out as Indians , overtook the train of emigrant wagons some three hundred miles south of Salt Lake City , and made an attack .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 22]: But the emigrants threw up earthworks , made fortresses of their wagons and defended themselves gallantly and successfully for five days !
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 27]: Your Missouri or Arkansas gentleman is not much afraid of the sort of scurvy apologies for `` Indians '' which the southern part of Utah affords .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 11]: He would stand up and fight five hundred of them .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 13]: At the end of the five days the Mormons tried military strategy .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 42]: They retired to the upper end of the `` Meadows , '' resumed civilized apparel , washed off their paint , and then , heavily armed , drove down in wagons to the beleaguered emigrants , bearing a flag of truce !
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 20]: When the emigrants saw white men coming they threw down their guns and welcomed them with cheer after cheer !
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 32]: And , all unconscious of the poetry of it , no doubt , they lifted a little child aloft , dressed in white , in answer to the flag of truce !
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 23]: The leaders of the timely white `` deliverers '' were President Haight and Bishop John D. Lee , of the Mormon Church .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 55]: Mr. Cradlebaugh , who served a term as a Federal Judge in Utah and afterward was sent to Congress from Nevada , tells in a speech delivered in Congress how these leaders next proceeded : `` They professed to be on good terms with the Indians , and represented them as being very mad .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 13]: They also proposed to intercede and settle the matter with the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 43]: After several hours parley they , having -LRB- apparently -RRB- visited the Indians , gave the ultimatum of the savages ; which was , that the emigrants should march out of their camp , leaving everything behind them , even their guns .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 22]: It was promised by the Mormon bishops that they would bring a force and guard the emigrants back to the settlements .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 18]: The terms were agreed to , the emigrants being desirous of saving the lives of their families .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 14]: The Mormons retired , and subsequently appeared with thirty or forty armed men .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 25]: The emigrants were marched out , the women and children in front and the men behind , the Mormon guard being in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 19]: When they had marched in this way about a mile , at a given signal the slaughter commenced .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 15]: The men were almost all shot down at the first fire from the guard .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 25]: Two only escaped , who fled to the desert , and were followed one hundred and fifty miles before they were overtaken and slaughtered .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 29]: The women and children ran on , two or three hundred yards further , when they were overtaken and with the aid of the Indians they were slaughtered .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 29]: Seventeen individuals only , of all the emigrant party , were spared , and they were little children , the eldest of them being only seven years old .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 29]: Thus , on the 10th day of September , 1857 , was consummated one of the most cruel , cowardly and bloody murders known in our history . ''
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 17]: The number of persons butchered by the Mormons on this occasion was one hundred and twenty .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 18]: With unheard-of temerity Judge Cradlebaugh opened his court and proceeded to make Mormondom answer for the massacre .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 49]: And what a spectacle it must have been to see this grim veteran , solitary and alone in his pride and his pluck , glowering down on his Mormon jury and Mormon auditory , deriding them by turns , and by turns `` breathing threatenings and slaughter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 71]: An editorial in the Territorial Enterprise of that day says of him and of the occasion : `` He spoke and acted with the fearlessness and resolution of a Jackson ; but the jury failed to indict , or even report on the charges , while threats of violence were heard in every quarter , and an attack on the U.S. troops intimated , if he persisted in his course .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 22]: `` Finding that nothing could be done with the juries , they were discharged with a scathing rebuke from the judge .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 15]: And then , sitting as a committing magistrate , he commenced his task alone .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 34]: He examined witnesses , made arrests in every quarter , and created a consternation in the camps of the saints greater than any they had ever witnessed before , since Mormondom was born .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 47]: At last accounts terrified elders and bishops were decamping to save their necks ; and developments of the most starling character were being made , implicating the highest Church dignitaries in the many murders and robberies committed upon the Gentiles during the past eight years . ''
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 51]: Had Harney been Governor , Cradlebaugh would have been supported in his work , and the absolute proofs adduced by him of Mormon guilt in this massacre and in a number of previous murders , would have conferred gratuitous coffins upon certain citizens , together with occasion to use them .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 28]: But Cumming was the Federal Governor , and he , under a curious pretense of impartiality , sought to screen the Mormons from the demands of justice .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 27]: On one occasion he even went so far as to publish his protest against the use of the U.S. troops in aid of Cradlebaugh 's proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 91]: Mrs. C. V. Waite closes her interesting detail of the great massacre with the following remark and accompanying summary of the testimony -- and the summary is concise , accurate and reliable : `` For the benefit of those who may still be disposed to doubt the guilt of Young and his Mormons in this transaction , the testimony is here collated and circumstances given which go not merely to implicate but to fasten conviction upon them by ` confirmations strong as proofs of Holy Writ : ' `` 1 .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 25]: The evidence of Mormons themselves , engaged in the affair , as shown by the statements of Judge Cradlebaugh and Deputy U.S. Marshall Rodgers .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 3]: `` 2 .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 20]: The failure of Brigham Young to embody any account of it in his Report as Superintendent of Indian Affairs .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 21]: Also his failure to make any allusion to it whatever from the pulpit , until several years after the occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 3]: `` 3 .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 30]: The flight to the mountains of men high in authority in the Mormon Church and State , when this affair was brought to the ordeal of a judicial investigation .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 3]: `` 4 .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 42]: The failure of the Deseret News , the Church organ , and the only paper then published in the Territory , to notice the massacre until several months afterward , and then only to deny that Mormons were engaged in it .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 3]: `` 5 .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 10]: The testimony of the children saved from the massacre .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 3]: `` 6 .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 28]: The children and the property of the emigrants found in possession of the Mormons , and that possession traced back to the very day after the massacre .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 3]: `` 7 .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 53]: The statements of Indians in the neighborhood of the scene of the massacre : these statements are shown , not only by Cradlebaugh and Rodgers , but by a number of military officers , and by J. Forney , who was , in 1859 , Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Territory .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 14]: To all these were such statements freely and frequently made by the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 3]: `` 8 .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 39]: The testimony of R. P. Campbell , Capt. 2d Dragoons , who was sent in the Spring of 1859 to Santa Clara , to protect travelers on the road to California and to inquire into Indian depredations . ''
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 28]: C. CONCERNING A FRIGHTFUL ASSASSINATION THAT WAS NEVER CONSUMMATED If ever there was a harmless man , it is Conrad Wiegand , of Gold Hill , Nevada .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 21]: If ever there was a gentle spirit that thought itself unfired gunpowder and latent ruin , it is Conrad Wiegand .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 46]: If ever there was an oyster that fancied itself a whale ; or a jack-o'lantern , confined to a swamp , that fancied itself a planet with a billion-mile orbit ; or a summer zephyr that deemed itself a hurricane , it is Conrad Wiegand .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 45]: Therefore , what wonder is it that when he says a thing , he thinks the world listens ; that when he does a thing the world stands still to look ; and that when he suffers , there is a convulsion of nature ?
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 30]: When I met Conrad , he was `` Superintendent of the Gold Hill Assay Office '' -- and he was not only its Superintendent , but its entire force .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 26]: And he was a street preacher , too , with a mongrel religion of his own invention , whereby he expected to regenerate the universe .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 5]: This was years ago .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 29]: Here latterly he has entered journalism ; and his journalism is what it might be expected to be : colossal to ear , but pigmy to the eye .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 17]: It is extravagant grandiloquence confined to a newspaper about the size of a double letter sheet .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 36]: He doubtless edits , sets the type , and prints his paper , all alone ; but he delights to speak of the concern as if it occupies a block and employs a thousand men .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 28]: -LSB- Something less than two years ago , Conrad assailed several people mercilessly in his little `` People 's Tribune , '' and got himself into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 39]: Straightway he airs the affair in the `` Territorial Enterprise , '' in a communication over his own signature , and I propose to reproduce it here , in all its native simplicity and more than human candor .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 39]: Long as it is , it is well worth reading , for it is the richest specimen of journalistic literature the history of America can furnish , perhaps :] From the Territorial Enterprise , Jan. 20 , 1870 .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 6]: SEEMING PLOT FOR ASSASSINATION MISCARRIED .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 112]: TO THE EDITOR OF THE ENTERPRISE : Months ago , when Mr. Sutro incidentally exposed mining management on the Comstock , and among others roused me to protest against its continuance , in great kindness you warned me that any attempt by publications , by public meetings and by legislative action , aimed at the correction of chronic mining evils in Storey County , must entail upon me -LRB- a -RRB- business ruin , -LRB- b -RRB- the burden of all its costs , -LRB- c -RRB- personal violence , and if my purpose were persisted in , then -LRB- d -RRB- assassination , and after all nothing would be effected .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 4]: YOUR PROPHECY FULFILLING .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 58]: In large part at least your prophecies have been fulfilled , for -LRB- a -RRB- assaying , which was well attended to in the Gold Hill Assay Office -LRB- of which I am superintendent -RRB- , in consequence of my publications , has been taken elsewhere , so the President of one of the companies assures me .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 12]: With no reason assigned , other work has been taken away .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 21]: With but one or two important exceptions , our assay business now consists simply of the gleanings of the vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 44]: -LRB- b -RRB- Though my own personal donations to the People 's Tribune Association have already exceeded $ 1,500 , outside of our own numbers we have received -LRB- in money -RRB- less than $ 300 as contributions and subscriptions for the journal .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 62]: -LRB- c -RRB- On Thursday last , on the main street in Gold Hill , near noon , with neither warning nor cause assigned , by a powerful blow I was felled to the ground , and while down I was kicked by a man who it would seem had been led to believe that I had spoken derogatorily of him .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 16]: By whom he was so induced to believe I am as yet unable to say .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 49]: On Saturday last I was again assailed and beaten by a man who first informed me why he did so , and who persisted in making his assault even after the erroneous impression under which he also was at first laboring had been clearly and repeatedly pointed out .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 139]: This same man , after failing through intimidation to elicit from me the names of our editorial contributors , against giving which he knew me to be pledged , beat himself weary upon me with a raw hide , I not resisting , and then pantingly threatened me with permanent disfiguring mayhem , if ever again I should introduce his name into print , and who but a few minutes before his attack upon me assured me that the only reason I was `` permitted '' to reach home alive on Wednesday evening last -LRB- at which time the PEOPLE 'S TRIBUNE was issued -RRB- was , that he deems me only half-witted , and be it remembered the very next morning I was knocked down and kicked by a man who seemed to be prepared for flight .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 12]: -LSB- He sees doom impending :] WHEN WILL THE CIRCLE JOIN ?
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 160]: How long before the whole of your prophecy will be fulfilled I can not say , but under the shadow of so much fulfillment in so short a time , and with such threats from a man who is one of the most prominent exponents of the San Francisco mining-ring staring me and this whole community defiantly in the face and pointing to a completion of your augury , do you blame me for feeling that this communication is the last I shall ever write for the Press , especially when a sense alike of personal self-respect , of duty to this money-oppressed and fear-ridden community , and of American fealty to the spirit of true Liberty all command me , and each more loudly than love of life itself , to declare the name of that prominent man to be JOHN B. WINTERS , President of the Yellow Jacket Company , a political aspirant and a military General ?
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 31]: The name of his partially duped accomplice and abettor in this last marvelous assault , is no other than PHILIP LYNCH , Editor and Proprietor of the Gold Hill News .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 129]: Despite the insult and wrong heaped upon me by John B. Winters , on Saturday afternoon , only a glimpse of which I shall be able to afford your readers , so much do I deplore clinching -LRB- by publicity -RRB- a serious mistake of any one , man or woman , committed under natural and not self-wrought passion , in view of his great apparent excitement at the time and in view of the almost perfect privacy of the assault , I am far from sure that I should not have given him space for repentance before exposing him , were it not that he himself has so far exposed the matter as to make it the common talk of the town that he has horsewhipped me .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 68]: That fact having been made public , all the facts in connection need to be also , or silence on my part would seem more than singular , and with many would be proof either that I was conscious of some unworthy aim in publishing the article , or else that my `` non-combatant '' principles are but a convenient cloak alike of physical and moral cowardice .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 78]: I therefore shall try to present a graphic but truthful picture of this whole affair , but shall forbear all comments , presuming that the editors of our own journal , if others do not , will speak freely and fittingly upon this subject in our next number , whether I shall then be dead or living , for my death will not stop , though it may suspend , the publication of the PEOPLE 'S TRIBUNE .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 26]: -LSB- The `` non-combatant '' sticks to principle , but takes along a friend or two of a conveniently different stripe :] THE TRAP SET .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 27]: On Saturday morning John B. Winters sent verbal word to the Gold Hill Assay Office that he desired to see me at the Yellow Jacket office .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 91]: Though such a request struck me as decidedly cool in view of his own recent discourtesies to me there alike as a publisher and as a stockholder in the Yellow Jacket mine , and though it seemed to me more like a summons than the courteous request by one gentleman to another for a favor , hoping that some conference with Sharon looking to the betterment of mining matters in Nevada might arise from it , I felt strongly inclined to overlook what possibly was simply an oversight in courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 31]: But as then it had only been two days since I had been bruised and beaten under a hasty and false apprehension of facts , my caution was somewhat aroused .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 18]: Moreover I remembered sensitively his contemptuousness of manner to me at my last interview in his office .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 39]: I therefore felt it needful , if I went at all , to go accompanied by a friend whom he would not dare to treat with incivility , and whose presence with me might secure exemption from insult .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 9]: Accordingly I asked a neighbor to accompany me .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 5]: THE TRAP ALMOST DETECTED .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 56]: Although I was not then aware of this fact , it would seem that previous to my request this same neighbor had heard Dr. Zabriskie state publicly in a saloon , that Mr. Winters had told him he had decided either to kill or to horsewhip me , but had not finally decided on which .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 22]: My neighbor , therefore , felt unwilling to go down with me until he had first called on Mr. Winters alone .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 7]: He therefore paid him a visit .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 43]: From that interview he assured me that he gathered the impression that he did not believe I would have any difficulty with Mr. Winters , and that he -LRB- Winters -RRB- would call on me at four o'clock in my own office .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 4]: MY OWN PRECAUTIONS .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 34]: As Sheriff Cummings was in Gold Hill that afternoon , and as I desired to converse with him about the previous assault , I invited him to my office , and he came .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 27]: Although a half hour had passed beyond four o'clock , Mr. Winters had not called , and we both of us began preparing to go home .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 40]: Just then , Philip Lynch , Publisher of the Gold Hill News , came in and said , blandly and cheerily , as if bringing good news : `` Hello , John B. Winters wants to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 6]: I replied , `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 19]: Why he sent me word that he would call on me here this afternoon at four o'clock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 41]: `` O , well , it do n't do to be too ceremonious just now , he 's in my office , and that will do as well -- come on in , Winters wants to consult with you alone .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 10]: He 's got something to say to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 69]: Though slightly uneasy at this change of programme , yet believing that in an editor 's house I ought to be safe , and anyhow that I would be within hail of the street , I hurriedly , and but partially whispered my dim apprehensions to Mr. Cummings , and asked him if he would not keep near enough to hear my voice in case I should call .
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 29]: He consented to do so while waiting for some other parties , and to come in if he heard my voice or thought I had need of protection .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 31]: On reaching the editorial part of the News office , which viewed from the street is dark , I did not see Mr. Winters , and again my misgivings arose .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 47]: Had I paused long enough to consider the case , I should have invited Sheriff Cummings in , but as Lynch went down stairs , he said : `` This way , Wiegand -- it 's best to be private , '' or some such remark .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 105]: -LSB- I do not desire to strain the reader 's fancy , hurtfully , and yet it would be a favor to me if he would try to fancy this lamb in battle , or the duelling ground or at the head of a vigilance committee -- M. T. :] I followed , and without Mr. Cummings , and without arms , which I never do or will carry , unless as a soldier in war , or unless I should yet come to feel I must fight a duel , or to join and aid in the ranks of a necessary Vigilance Committee .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 9]: But by following I made a fatal mistake .
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 33]: Following was entering a trap , and whatever animal suffers itself to be caught should expect the common fate of a caged rat , as I fear events to come will prove .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 8]: Traps commonly are not set for benevolence .
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 11]: -LSB- His body-guard is shut out :] THE TRAP INSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 6]: I followed Lynch down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 14]: At their foot a door to the left opened into a small room .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 188]: From that room another door opened into yet another room , and once entered I found myself inveigled into what many will ever henceforth regard as a private subterranean Gold Hill den , admirably adapted in proper hands to the purposes of murder , raw or disguised , for from it , with both or even one door closed , when too late , I saw that I could not be heard by Sheriff Cummings , and from it , BY VIOLENCE AND BY FORCE , I was prevented from making a peaceable exit , when I thought I saw the studious object of this `` consultation '' was no other than to compass my killing , in the presence of Philip Lynch as a witness , as soon as by insult a proverbially excitable man should be exasperated to the point of assailing Mr. Winters , so that Mr. Lynch , by his conscience and by his well known tenderness of heart toward the rich and potent would be compelled to testify that he saw Gen. John B. Winters kill Conrad Wiegand in `` self-defence . ''
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 7]: But I am going too fast .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 3]: OUR HOST .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 28]: Mr. Lynch was present during the most of the time -LRB- say a little short of an hour -RRB- , but three times he left the room .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 17]: His testimony , therefore , would be available only as to the bulk of what transpired .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 18]: On entering this carpeted den I was invited to a seat near one corner of the room .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 9]: Mr. Lynch took a seat near the window .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 83]: J. B. Winters sat -LRB- at first -RRB- near the door , and began his remarks essentially as follows : `` I have come here to exact of you a retraction , in black and white , of those damnably false charges which you have preferred against me in that -- infamous lying sheet of yours , and you must declare yourself their author , that you published them knowing them to be false , and that your motives were malicious . ''
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 6]: `` Hold , Mr. Winters .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 10]: Your language is insulting and your demand an enormity .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 14]: I trust I was not invited here either to be insulted or coerced .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 15]: I supposed myself here by invitation of Mr. Lynch , at your request . ''
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 10]: `` Nor did I come here to insult you .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 16]: I have already told you that I am here for a very different purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 15]: `` Yet your language has been offensive , and even now shows strong excitement .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 30]: If insult is repeated I shall either leave the room or call in Sheriff Cummings , whom I just left standing and waiting for me outside the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 9]: `` No , you wo n't , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 12]: You may just as well understand it at once as not .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 13]: Here you are my man , and I 'll tell you why !
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 26]: Months ago you put your property out of your hands , boasting that you did so to escape losing it on prosecution for libel . ''
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 36]: `` It is true that I did convert all my immovable property into personal property , such as I could trust safely to others , and chiefly to escape ruin through possible libel suits . ''
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 6]: `` Very good , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 29]: Having placed yourself beyond the pale of the law , may God help your soul if you DO N'T make precisely such a retraction as I have demanded .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 88]: I 've got you now , and by -- before you can get out of this room you 've got to both write and sign precisely the retraction I have demanded , and before you go , anyhow -- you -- low-lived -- lying -- , I 'll teach you what personal responsibility is outside of the law ; and , by -- , Sheriff Cummings and all the friends you 've got in the world besides , ca n't save you , you -- , etc. !
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 4]: No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 63]: I 'm alone now , and I 'm prepared to be shot down just here and now rather than be villified by you as I have been , and suffer you to escape me after publishing those charges , not only here where I am known and universally respected , but where I am not personally known and may be injured . ''
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 95]: I confess this speech , with its terrible and but too plainly implied threat of killing me if I did not sign the paper he demanded , terrified me , especially as I saw he was working himself up to the highest possible pitch of passion , and instinct told me that any reply other than one of seeming concession to his demands would only be fuel to a raging fire , so I replied : `` Well , if I 've got to sign -- , '' and then I paused some time .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 16]: Resuming , I said , `` But , Mr. Winters , you are greatly excited .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 12]: Besides , I see you are laboring under a total misapprehension .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 12]: It is your duty not to inflame but to calm yourself .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 41]: I am prepared to show you , if you will only point out the article that you allude to , that you regard as ` charges ' what no calm and logical mind has any right to regard as such .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 47]: Show me the charges , and I will try , at all events ; and if it becomes plain that no charges have been preferred , then plainly there can be nothing to retract , and no one could rightly urge you to demand a retraction .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 25]: You should beware of making so serious a mistake , for however honest a man may be , every one is liable to misapprehend .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 19]: Besides you assume that I am the author of some certain article which you have not pointed out .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 8]: It is hasty to do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 23]: He then pointed to some numbered paragraphs in a TRIBUNE article , headed `` What 's the Matter with Yellow Jacket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 10]: saying `` That 's what I refer to . ''
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 32]: To gain time for general reflection and resolution , I took up the paper and looked it over for awhile , he remaining silent , and as I hoped , cooling .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 10]: I then resumed saying , `` As I supposed .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 30]: I do not admit having written that article , nor have you any right to assume so important a point , and then base important action upon your assumption .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 7]: You might deeply regret it afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 32]: In my published Address to the People , I notified the world that no information as to the authorship of any article would be given without the consent of the writer .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 19]: I therefore can not honorably tell you who wrote that article , nor can you exact it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 18]: `` If you are not the author , then I do demand to know who is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 8]: `` I must decline to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 20]: `` Then , by -- , I brand you as its author , and shall treat you accordingly . ''
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 41]: `` Passing that point , the most important misapprehension which I notice is , that you regard them as ` charges ' at all , when their context , both at their beginning and end , show they are not .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 28]: These words introduce them : ` Such an investigation -LSB- just before indicated -RSB- , we think MIGHT result in showing some of the following points . '
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 25]: Then follow eleven specifications , and the succeeding paragraph shows that the suggested investigation ` might EXONERATE those who are generally believed guilty . '
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 24]: You see , therefore , the context proves they are not preferred as charges , and this you seem to have overlooked . ''
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 33]: While making those comments , Mr. Winters frequently interrupted me in such a way as to convince me that he was resolved not to consider candidly the thoughts contained in my words .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 65]: He insisted upon it that they were charges , and `` By -- , '' he would make me take them back as charges , and he referred the question to Philip Lynch , to whom I then appealed as a literary man , as a logician , and as an editor , calling his attention especially to the introductory paragraph just before quoted .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 66]: He replied , `` if they are not charges , they certainly are insinuations , '' whereupon Mr. Winters renewed his demands for retraction precisely such as he had before named , except that he would allow me to state who did write the article if I did not myself , and this time shaking his fist in my face with more cursings and epithets .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 90]: When he threatened me with his clenched fist , instinctively I tried to rise from my chair , but Winters then forcibly thrust me down , as he did every other time -LRB- at least seven or eight -RRB- , when under similar imminent danger of bruising by his fist -LRB- or for aught I could know worse than that after the first stunning blow -RRB- , which he could easily and safely to himself have dealt me so long as he kept me down and stood over me .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 48]: This fact it was , which more than anything else , convinced me that by plan and plot I was purposely made powerless in Mr. Winters ' hands , and that he did not mean to allow me that advantage of being afoot , which he possessed .
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 30]: Moreover , I then became convinced , that Philip Lynch -LRB- and for what reason I wondered -RRB- would do absolutely nothing to protect me in his own house .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 7]: I realized then the situation thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 25]: I had found it equally vain to protest or argue , and I would make no unmanly appeal for pity , still less apologize .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 12]: Yet my life had been by the plainest possible implication threatened .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 6]: I was a weak man .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 4]: I was unarmed .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 13]: I was helplessly down , and Winters was afoot and probably armed .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 8]: Lynch was the only `` witness . ''
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 33]: The statements demanded , if given and not explained , would utterly sink me in my own self-respect , in my family 's eyes , and in the eyes of the community .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 53]: On the other hand , should I give the author 's name how could I ever expect that confidence of the People which I should no longer deserve , and how much dearer to me and to my family was my life than the life of the real author to his friends .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 15]: Yet life seemed dear and each minute that remained seemed precious if not solemn .
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 66]: I sincerely trust that neither you nor any of your readers , and especially none with families , may ever be placed in such seeming direct proximity to death while obliged to decide the one question I was compelled to , viz. : What should I do -- I , a man of family , and not as Mr. Winters is , `` alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 11]: -LSB- The reader is requested not to skip the following .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 8]: -- M. T. :] STRATEGY AND MESMERISM .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 66]: To gain time for further reflection , and hoping that by a seeming acquiescence I might regain my personal liberty , at least till I could give an alarm , or take advantage of some momentary inadvertence of Winters , and then without a cowardly flight escape , I resolved to write a certain kind of retraction , but previously had inwardly decided : First .
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 68]: -- That I would studiously avoid every action which might be construed into the drawing of a weapon , even by a self-infuriated man , no matter what amount of insult might be heaped upon me , for it seemed to me that this great excess of compound profanity , foulness and epithet must be more than a mere indulgence , and therefore must have some object .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 16]: `` Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird . ''
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 29]: Therefore , as before without thought , I thereafter by intent kept my hands away from my pockets , and generally in sight and spread upon my knees .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 2]: Second .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 20]: -- I resolved to make no motion with my arms or hands which could possibly be construed into aggression .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 2]: Third .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 13]: -- I resolved completely to govern my outward manner and suppress indignation .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 10]: To do this , I must govern my spirit .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 36]: To do that , by force of imagination I was obliged like actors on the boards to resolve myself into an unnatural mental state and see all things through the eyes of an assumed character .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 2]: Fourth .
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 44]: -- I resolved to try on Winters , silently , and unconsciously to himself a mesmeric power which I possess over certain kinds of people , and which at times I have found to work even in the dark over the lower animals .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 9]: Does any one smile at these last counts ?
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 38]: God save you from ever being obliged to beat in a game of chess , whose stake is your life , you having but four poor pawns and pieces and your adversary with his full force unshorn .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 19]: But if you are , provided you have any strength with breadth of will , do not despair .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 19]: Though mesmeric power may not save you , it may help you ; try it at all events .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 26]: In this instance I was conscious of power coming into me , and by a law of nature , I know Winters was correspondingly weakened .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 18]: If I could have gained more time I am sure he would not even have struck me .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 13]: It takes time both to form such resolutions and to recite them .
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 62]: That time , however , I gained while thinking of my retraction , which I first wrote in pencil , altering it from time to time till I got it to suit me , my aim being to make it look like a concession to demands , while in fact it should tersely speak the truth into Mr. Winters ' mind .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 25]: When it was finished , I copied it in ink , and if correctly copied from my first draft it should read as follows .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 12]: In copying I do not think I made any material change .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 2]: COPY .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 55]: To Philip Lynch , Editor of the Gold Hill News : I learn that Gen. John B. Winters believes the following -LRB- pasted on -RRB- clipping from the PEOPLE 'S TRIBUNE of January to contain distinct charges of mine against him personally , and that as such he desires me to retract them unqualifiedly .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 66]: In compliance with his request , permit me to say that , although Mr. Winters and I see this matter differently , in view of his strong feelings in the premises , I hereby declare that I do not know those `` charges '' -LRB- if such they are -RRB- to be true , and I hope that a critical examination would altogether disprove them .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 3]: CONRAD WIEGAND .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 8]: Gold Hill , January 15 , 1870 .
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 52]: I then read what I had written and handed it to Mr. Lynch , whereupon Mr. Winters said : `` That 's not satisfactory , and it wo n't do ; '' and then addressing himself to Mr. Lynch , he further said : `` How does it strike you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 15]: `` Well , I confess I do n't see that it retracts anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 22]: `` Nor do I , '' said Winters ; `` in fact , I regard it as adding insult to injury .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 11]: Mr. Wiegand you 've got to do better than that .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 14]: You are not the man who can pull wool over my eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 14]: `` That , sir , is the only retraction I can write . ''
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 57]: `` No it is n't , sir , and if you so much as say so again you do it at your peril , for I 'll thrash you to within an inch of your life , and , by -- , sir , I do n't pledge myself to spare you even that inch either .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 25]: I want you to understand I have asked you for a very different paper , and that paper you 've got to sign . ''
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 41]: `` Mr. Winters , I assure you that I do not wish to irritate you , but , at the same time , it is utterly impossible for me to write any other paper than that which I have written .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 54]: If you are resolved to compel me to sign something , Philip Lynch 's hand must write at your dictation , and if , when written , I can sign it I will do so , but such a document as you say you must have from me , I never can sign .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 7]: I mean what I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 24]: `` Well , sir , what 's to be done must be done quickly , for I 've been here long enough already .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 28]: I 'll put the thing in another shape -LRB- and then pointing to the paper -RRB- ; do n't you know those charges to be false ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 6]: `` I do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 10]: `` Do you know them to be true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 11]: `` Of my own personal knowledge I do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 9]: `` Why then did you print them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 33]: `` Because rightly considered in their connection they are not charges , but pertinent and useful suggestions in answer to the queries of a correspondent who stated facts which are inexplicable . ''
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 13]: `` Do n't you know that I know they are false ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 19]: `` If you do , the proper course is simply to deny them and court an investigation . ''
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 24]: `` And do YOU claim the right to make ME come out and deny anything you may choose to write and print ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 30]: To that question I think I made no reply , and he then further said : `` Come , now , we 've talked about the matter long enough .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 15]: I want your final answer -- did you write that article or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 13]: `` I can not in honor tell you who wrote it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 12]: `` Did you not see it before it was printed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 7]: `` Most certainly , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 13]: `` And did you deem it a fit thing to publish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 16]: `` Most assuredly , sir , or I would never have consented to its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 23]: Of its authorship I can say nothing whatever , but for its publication I assume full , sole and personal responsibility . ''
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 11]: `` And do you then retract it or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 40]: `` Mr. Winters , if my refusal to sign such a paper as you have demanded must entail upon me all that your language in this room fairly implies , then I ask a few minutes for prayer . ''
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 3]: `` Prayer !
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 25]: -- you , this is not your hour for prayer -- your time to pray was when you were writing those -- lying charges .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 7]: Will you sign or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 8]: `` You already have my answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 6]: do you still refuse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 7]: `` I do , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 30]: `` Take that , then , '' and to my amazement and inexpressible relief he drew only a rawhide instead of what I expected -- a bludgeon or pistol .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 31]: With it , as he spoke , he struck at my left ear downwards , as if to tear it off , and afterwards on the side of the head .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 119]: As he moved away to get a better chance for a more effective shot , for the first time I gained a chance under peril to rise , and I did so pitying him from the very bottom of my soul , to think that one so naturally capable of true dignity , power and nobility could , by the temptations of this State , and by unfortunate associations and aspirations , be so deeply debased as to find in such brutality anything which he could call satisfaction -- but the great hope for us all is in progress and growth , and John B. Winters , I trust , will yet be able to comprehend my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 21]: He continued to beat me with all his great force , until absolutely weary , exhausted and panting for breath .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 29]: I still adhered to my purpose of non-aggressive defence , and made no other use of my arms than to defend my head and face from further disfigurement .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 35]: The mere pain arising from the blows he inflicted upon my person was of course transient , and my clothing to some extent deadened its severity , as it now hides all remaining traces .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 112]: When I supposed he was through , taking the butt end of his weapon and shaking it in my face , he warned me , if I correctly understood him , of more yet to come , and furthermore said , if ever I again dared introduce his name to print , in either my own or any other public journal , he would cut off my left ear -LRB- and I do not think he was jesting -RRB- and send me home to my family a visibly mutilated man , to be a standing warning to all low-lived puppies who seek to blackmail gentlemen and to injure their good names .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 22]: And when he did so operate , he informed me that his implement would not be a whip but a knife .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 89]: When he had said this , unaccompanied by Mr. Lynch , as I remember it , he left the room , for I sat down by Mr. Lynch , exclaiming : `` The man is mad -- he is utterly mad -- this step is his ruin -- it is a mistake -- it would be ungenerous in me , despite of all the ill usage I have here received , to expose him , at least until he has had an opportunity to reflect upon the matter .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 8]: I shall be in no haste . ''
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 30]: `` Winters is very mad just now , '' replied Mr. Lynch , `` but when he is himself he is one of the finest men I ever met .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 30]: In fact , he told me the reason he did not meet you upstairs was to spare you the humiliation of a beating in the sight of others . ''
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 106]: I submit that that unguarded remark of Philip Lynch convicts him of having been privy in advance to Mr. Winters ' intentions whatever they may have been , or at least to his meaning to make an assault upon me , but I leave to others to determine how much censure an editor deserves for inveigling a weak , non-combatant man , also a publisher , to a pen of his own to be horsewhipped , if no worse , for the simple printing of what is verbally in the mouth of nine out of ten men , and women too , upon the street .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 51]: While writing this account two theories have occurred to me as possibly true respecting this most remarkable assault : First -- The aim may have been simply to extort from me such admissions as in the hands of money and influence would have sent me to the Penitentiary for libel .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 32]: This , however , seems unlikely , because any statements elicited by fear or force could not be evidence in law or could be so explained as to have no force .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 14]: The statements wanted so badly must have been desired for some other purpose .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 79]: Second -- The other theory has so dark and wilfully murderous a look that I shrink from writing it , yet as in all probability my death at the earliest practicable moment has already been decreed , I feel I should do all I can before my hour arrives , at least to show others how to break up that aristocratic rule and combination which has robbed all Nevada of true freedom , if not of manhood itself .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 69]: Although I do not prefer this hypothesis as a `` charge , '' I feel that as an American citizen I still have a right both to think and to speak my thoughts even in the land of Sharon and Winters , and as much so respecting the theory of a brutal assault -LRB- especially when I have been its subject -RRB- as respecting any other apparent enormity .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 34]: I give the matter simply as a suggestion which may explain to the proper authorities and to the people whom they should represent , a well ascertained but notwithstanding a darkly mysterious fact .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 33]: The scheme of the assault may have been : First -- To terrify me by making me conscious of my own helplessness after making actual though not legal threats against my life .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 52]: Second -- To imply that I could save my life only by writing or signing certain specific statements which if not subsequently explained would eternally have branded me as infamous and would have consigned my family to shame and want , and to the dreadful compassion and patronage of the rich .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 28]: Third -- To blow my brains out the moment I had signed , thereby preventing me from making any subsequent explanation such as could remove the infamy .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 33]: Fourth -- Philip Lynch to be compelled to testify that I was killed by John B. Winters in self-defence , for the conviction of Winters would bring him in as an accomplice .
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 36]: If that was the programme in John B. Winters ' mind nothing saved my life but my persistent refusal to sign , when that refusal seemed clearly to me to be the choice of death .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 62]: The remarkable assertion made to me by Mr. Winters , that pity only spared my life on Wednesday evening last , almost compels me to believe that at first he could not have intended me to leave that room alive ; and why I was allowed to , unless through mesmeric or some other invisible influence , I can not divine .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 19]: The more I reflect upon this matter , the more probable as true does this horrible interpretation become .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 105]: The narration of these things I might have spared both to Mr. Winters and to the public had he himself observed silence , but as he has both verbally spoken and suffered a thoroughly garbled statement of facts to appear in the Gold Hill News I feel it due to myself no less than to this community , and to the entire independent press of America and Great Britain , to give a true account of what even the Gold Hill News has pronounced a disgraceful affair , and which it deeply regrets because of some alleged telegraphic mistake in the account of it .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 8]: -LSB- Who received the erroneous telegrams ? -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 57]: Though he may not deem it prudent to take my life just now , the publication of this article I feel sure must compel Gen. Winters -LRB- with his peculiar views about his right to exemption from criticism by me -RRB- to resolve on my violent death , though it may take years to compass it .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 76]: Notwithstanding I bear him no ill will ; and if W. C. Ralston and William Sharon , and other members of the San Francisco mining and milling Ring feel that he above all other men in this State and California is the most fitting man to supervise and control Yellow Jacket matters , until I am able to vote more than half their stock I presume he will be retained to grace his present post .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 97]: Meantime , I cordially invite all who know of any sort of important villainy which only can be cured by exposure -LRB- and who would expose it if they felt sure they would not be betrayed under bullying threats -RRB- , to communicate with the PEOPLE 'S TRIBUNE ; for until I am murdered , so long as I can raise the means to publish , I propose to continue my efforts at least to revive the liberties of the State , to curb oppression , and to benefit man 's world and God 's earth .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 3]: CONRAD WIEGAND .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 65]: -LSB- It does seem a pity that the Sheriff was shut out , since the good sense of a general of militia and of a prominent editor failed to teach them that the merited castigation of this weak , half-witted child was a thing that ought to have been done in the street , where the poor thing could have a chance to run .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 55]: When a journalist maligns a citizen , or attacks his good name on hearsay evidence , he deserves to be thrashed for it , even if he is a `` non-combatant '' weakling ; but a generous adversary would at least allow such a lamb the use of his legs at such a time .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 4]: -- M. T. -RSB-
