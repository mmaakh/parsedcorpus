Parsing [sent. 1 len. 24]: TOM SAWYER ABROAD By Mark Twain CHAPTER I. TOM SEEKS NEW ADVENTURES DO you reckon Tom Sawyer was satisfied after all them adventures ?
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 27]: I mean the adventures we had down the river , and the time we set the darky Jim free and Tom got shot in the leg .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 6]: No , he was n't .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 10]: It only just p ` isoned him for more .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 8]: That was all the effect it had .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 61]: You see , when we three came back up the river in glory , as you may say , from that long travel , and the village received us with a torchlight procession and speeches , and everybody hurrah 'd and shouted , it made us heroes , and that was what Tom Sawyer had always been hankering to be .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 7]: For a while he WAS satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 23]: Everybody made much of him , and he tilted up his nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 18]: Some called him Tom Sawyer the Traveler , and that just swelled him up fit to bust .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 36]: You see he laid over me and Jim considerable , because we only went down the river on a raft and came back by the steamboat , but Tom went by the steamboat both ways .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 13]: The boys envied me and Jim a good deal , but land !
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 9]: they just knuckled to the dirt before TOM .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 60]: Well , I do n't know ; maybe he might have been satisfied if it had n't been for old Nat Parsons , which was postmaster , and powerful long and slim , and kind o ' good-hearted and silly , and bald-headed , on account of his age , and about the talkiest old cretur I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 67]: For as much as thirty years he 'd been the only man in the village that had a reputation -- I mean a reputation for being a traveler , and of course he was mortal proud of it , and it was reckoned that in the course of that thirty years he had told about that journey over a million times and enjoyed it every time .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 32]: And now comes along a boy not quite fifteen , and sets everybody admiring and gawking over HIS travels , and it just give the poor old man the high strikes .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 20]: It made him sick to listen to Tom , and to hear the people say `` My land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 6]: `` Did you ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 7]: `` My goodness sakes alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 30]: and all such things ; but he could n't pull away from it , any more than a fly that 's got its hind leg fast in the molasses .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 50]: And always when Tom come to a rest , the poor old cretur would chip in on HIS same old travels and work them for all they were worth ; but they were pretty faded , and did n't go for much , and it was pitiful to see .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 37]: And then Tom would take another innings , and then the old man again -- and so on , and so on , for an hour and more , each trying to beat out the other .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 46]: You see , Parsons ' travels happened like this : When he first got to be postmaster and was green in the business , there come a letter for somebody he did n't know , and there was n't any such person in the village .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 40]: Well , he did n't know what to do , nor how to act , and there the letter stayed and stayed , week in and week out , till the bare sight of it gave him a conniption .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 17]: The postage was n't paid on it , and that was another thing to worry about .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 41]: There was n't any way to collect that ten cents , and he reckon 'd the gov ` ment would hold him responsible for it and maybe turn him out besides , when they found he had n't collected it .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 12]: Well , at last he could n't stand it any longer .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 54]: He could n't sleep nights , he could n't eat , he was thinned down to a shadder , yet he da ` s n't ask anybody 's advice , for the very person he asked for advice might go back on him and let the gov ` ment know about the letter .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 73]: He had the letter buried under the floor , but that did no good ; if he happened to see a person standing over the place it 'd give him the cold shivers , and loaded him up with suspicions , and he would sit up that night till the town was still and dark , and then he would sneak there and get it out and bury it in another place .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 55]: Of course , people got to avoiding him and shaking their heads and whispering , because , the way he was looking and acting , they judged he had killed somebody or done something terrible , they did n't know what , and if he had been a stranger they would 've lynched him .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 147]: Well , as I was saying , it got so he could n't stand it any longer ; so he made up his mind to pull out for Washington , and just go to the President of the United States and make a clean breast of the whole thing , not keeping back an atom , and then fetch the letter out and lay it before the whole gov ` ment , and say , `` Now , there she is -- do with me what you 're a mind to ; though as heaven is my judge I am an innocent man and not deserving of the full penalties of the law and leaving behind me a family that must starve and yet had n't had a thing to do with it , which is the whole truth and I can swear to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 5]: So he did it .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 34]: He had a little wee bit of steamboating , and some stage-coaching , but all the rest of the way was horseback , and it took him three weeks to get to Washington .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 13]: He saw lots of land and lots of villages and four cities .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 26]: He was gone ` most eight weeks , and there never was such a proud man in the village as he when he got back .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 61]: His travels made him the greatest man in all that region , and the most talked about ; and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the country , and from over in the Illinois bottoms , too , just to look at him -- and there they 'd stand and gawk , and he 'd gabble .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 7]: You never see anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 28]: Well , there was n't any way now to settle which was the greatest traveler ; some said it was Nat , some said it was Tom .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 32]: Everybody allowed that Nat had seen the most longitude , but they had to give in that whatever Tom was short in longitude he had made up in latitude and climate .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 26]: It was about a stand-off ; so both of them had to whoop up their dangerous adventures , and try to get ahead THAT way .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 101]: That bullet-wound in Tom 's leg was a tough thing for Nat Parsons to buck against , but he bucked the best he could ; and at a disadvantage , too , for Tom did n't set still as he 'd orter done , to be fair , but always got up and sauntered around and worked his limp while Nat was painting up the adventure that HE had in Washington ; for Tom never let go that limp when his leg got well , but practiced it nights at home , and kept it good as new right along .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 45]: Nat 's adventure was like this ; I do n't know how true it is ; maybe he got it out of a paper , or somewhere , but I will say this for him , that he DID know how to tell it .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 37]: He could make anybody 's flesh crawl , and he 'd turn pale and hold his breath when he told it , and sometimes women and girls got so faint they could n't stick it out .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 69]: Well , it was this way , as near as I can remember : He come a-loping into Washington , and put up his horse and shoved out to the President 's house with his letter , and they told him the President was up to the Capitol , and just going to start for Philadelphia -- not a minute to lose if he wanted to catch him .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 11]: Nat ` most dropped , it made him so sick .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 15]: His horse was put up , and he did n't know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 19]: But just then along comes a darky driving an old ramshackly hack , and he see his chance .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 36]: He rushes out and shouts : `` A half a dollar if you git me to the Capitol in half an hour , and a quarter extra if you do it in twenty minutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 4]: `` Done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 4]: says the darky .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 34]: Nat he jumped in and slammed the door , and away they went a-ripping and a-tearing over the roughest road a body ever see , and the racket of it was something awful .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 69]: Nat passed his arms through the loops and hung on for life and death , but pretty soon the hack hit a rock and flew up in the air , and the bottom fell out , and when it come down Nat 's feet was on the ground , and he see he was in the most desperate danger if he could n't keep up with the hack .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 30]: He was horrible scared , but he laid into his work for all he was worth , and hung tight to the arm-loops and made his legs fairly fly .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 99]: He yelled and shouted to the driver to stop , and so did the crowds along the street , for they could see his legs spinning along under the coach , and his head and shoulders bobbing inside through the windows , and he was in awful danger ; but the more they all shouted the more the nigger whooped and yelled and lashed the horses and shouted , `` Do n't you fret , I ` se gwine to git you dah in time , boss ; I 's gwine to do it , sho ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 29]: for you see he thought they were all hurrying him up , and , of course , he could n't hear anything for the racket he was making .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 39]: And so they went ripping along , and everybody just petrified to see it ; and when they got to the Capitol at last it was the quickest trip that ever was made , and everybody said so .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 101]: The horses laid down , and Nat dropped , all tuckered out , and he was all dust and rags and barefooted ; but he was in time and just in time , and caught the President and give him the letter , and everything was all right , and the President give him a free pardon on the spot , and Nat give the nigger two extra quarters instead of one , because he could see that if he had n't had the hack he would n't ` a ' got there in time , nor anywhere near it .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 24]: It WAS a powerful good adventure , and Tom Sawyer had to work his bullet-wound mighty lively to hold his own against it .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 99]: Well , by and by Tom 's glory got to paling down gradu ` ly , on account of other things turning up for the people to talk about -- first a horse-race , and on top of that a house afire , and on top of that the circus , and on top of that the eclipse ; and that started a revival , same as it always does , and by that time there was n't any more talk about Tom , so to speak , and you never see a person so sick and disgusted .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 72]: Pretty soon he got to worrying and fretting right along day in and day out , and when I asked him what WAS he in such a state about , he said it ` most broke his heart to think how time was slipping away , and him getting older and older , and no wars breaking out and no way of making a name for himself that he could see .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 25]: Now that is the way boys is always thinking , but he was the first one I ever heard come out and say it .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 32]: So then he set to work to get up a plan to make him celebrated ; and pretty soon he struck it , and offered to take me and Jim in .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 10]: Tom Sawyer was always free and generous that way .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 45]: There 's a-plenty of boys that 's mighty good and friendly when YOU 'VE got a good thing , but when a good thing happens to come their way they do n't say a word to you , and try to hog it all .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 16]: That war n't ever Tom Sawyer 's way , I can say that for him .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 71]: There 's plenty of boys that will come hankering and groveling around you when you 've got an apple and beg the core off of you ; but when they 've got one , and you beg for the core and remind them how you give them a core one time , they say thank you ` most to death , but there ai n't a-going to be no core .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 19]: But I notice they always git come up with ; all you got to do is to wait .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 20]: Well , we went out in the woods on the hill , and Tom told us what it was .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 5]: It was a crusade .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 7]: `` What 's a crusade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 3]: I says .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 41]: He looked scornful , the way he 's always done when he was ashamed of a person , and says : `` Huck Finn , do you mean to tell me you do n't know what a crusade is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 12]: `` No , '' says I , `` I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 9]: And I do n't care to , nuther .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 17]: I 've lived till now and done without it , and had my health , too .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 18]: But as soon as you tell me , I 'll know , and that 's soon enough .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 29]: I do n't see any use in finding out things and clogging up my head with them when I may n't ever have any occasion to use 'em .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 22]: There was Lance Williams , he learned how to talk Choctaw here till one come and dug his grave for him .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 9]: Now , then , what 's a crusade ?
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 24]: But I can tell you one thing before you begin ; if it 's a patent-right , there 's no money in it .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 9]: Bill Thompson he -- '' `` Patent-right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 3]: says he .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 8]: `` I never see such an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 11]: Why , a crusade is a kind of war . ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 9]: I thought he must be losing his mind .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 18]: But no , he was in real earnest , and went right on , perfectly ca 'm .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 16]: `` A crusade is a war to recover the Holy Land from the paynim . ''
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 6]: `` Which Holy Land ? ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 14]: `` Why , the Holy Land -- there ai n't but one . ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 9]: `` What do we want of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 8]: `` Why , ca n't you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 22]: It 's in the hands of the paynim , and it 's our duty to take it away from them . ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 14]: `` How did we come to let them git hold of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 13]: `` We did n't come to let them git hold of it .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 6]: They always had it . ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 17]: `` Why , Tom , then it must belong to them , do n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 7]: `` Why of course it does .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 7]: Who said it did n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 20]: I studied over it , but could n't seem to git at the right of it , no way .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 14]: I says : `` It 's too many for me , Tom Sawyer .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 30]: If I had a farm and it was mine , and another person wanted it , would it be right for him to -- '' `` Oh , shucks !
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 15]: you do n't know enough to come in when it rains , Huck Finn .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 11]: It ai n't a farm , it 's entirely different .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 8]: You see , it 's like this .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 47]: They own the land , just the mere land , and that 's all they DO own ; but it was our folks , our Jews and Christians , that made it holy , and so they have n't any business to be there defiling it .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 15]: It 's a shame , and we ought not to stand it a minute .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 14]: We ought to march against them and take it away from them . ''
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 18]: `` Why , it does seem to me it 's the most mixed-up thing I ever see !
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 28]: Now , if I had a farm and another person -- '' `` Do n't I tell you it has n't got anything to do with farming ?
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 38]: Farming is business , just common low-down business : that 's all it is , it 's all you can say for it ; but this is higher , this is religious , and totally different . ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 16]: `` Religious to go and take the land away from people that owns it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 11]: `` Certainly ; it 's always been considered so . ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 29]: Jim he shook his head , and says : `` Mars Tom , I reckon dey 's a mistake about it somers -- dey mos ' sholy is .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 25]: I 's religious myself , en I knows plenty religious people , but I hai n't run across none dat acts like dat . ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 25]: It made Tom hot , and he says : `` Well , it 's enough to make a body sick , such mullet-headed ignorance !
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 105]: If either of you 'd read anything about history , you 'd know that Richard Cur de Loon , and the Pope , and Godfrey de Bulleyn , and lots more of the most noble-hearted and pious people in the world , hacked and hammered at the paynims for more than two hundred years trying to take their land away from them , and swum neck-deep in blood the whole time -- and yet here 's a couple of sap-headed country yahoos out in the backwoods of Missouri setting themselves up to know more about the rights and wrongs of it than they did !
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 5]: Talk about cheek ! ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 34]: Well , of course , that put a more different light on it , and me and Jim felt pretty cheap and ignorant , and wished we had n't been quite so chipper .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 82]: I could n't say nothing , and Jim he could n't for a while ; then he says : `` Well , den , I reckon it 's all right ; beca ` se ef dey did n't know , dey ai n't no use for po ' ignorant folks like us to be trying to know ; en so , ef it 's our duty , we got to go en tackle it en do de bes ' we can .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 14]: Same time , I feel as sorry for dem paynims as Mars Tom .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 27]: De hard part gwine to be to kill folks dat a body hai n't been ` quainted wid and dat hai n't done him no harm .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 7]: Dat 's it , you see .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 38]: Ef we wuz to go ` mongst 'em , jist we three , en say we 's hungry , en ast 'em for a bite to eat , why , maybe dey 's jist like yuther people .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 7]: Do n't you reckon dey is ?
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 21]: Why , DEY 'D give it , I know dey would , en den -- '' `` Then what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 12]: `` Well , Mars Tom , my idea is like dis .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 46]: It ai n't no use , we CA N'T kill dem po ' strangers dat ai n't doin ' us no harm , till we 've had practice -- I knows it perfectly well , Mars Tom -- ` deed I knows it perfectly well .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 62]: But ef we takes a ' axe or two , jist you en me en Huck , en slips acrost de river to-night arter de moon 's gone down , en kills dat sick fam ` ly dat 's over on the Sny , en burns dey house down , en -- '' `` Oh , you make me tired ! ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 3]: says Tom .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 53]: `` I do n't want to argue any more with people like you and Huck Finn , that 's always wandering from the subject , and ai n't got any more sense than to try to reason out a thing that 's pure theology by the laws that protect real estate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 11]: Now that 's just where Tom Sawyer war n't fair .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 15]: Jim did n't mean no harm , and I did n't mean no harm .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 70]: We knowed well enough that he was right and we was wrong , and all we was after was to get at the HOW of it , and that was all ; and the only reason he could n't explain it so we could understand it was because we was ignorant -- yes , and pretty dull , too , I ai n't denying that ; but , land !
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 10]: that ai n't no crime , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 83]: But he would n't hear no more about it -- just said if we had tackled the thing in the proper spirit , he would ` a ' raised a couple of thousand knights and put them in steel armor from head to heel , and made me a lieutenant and Jim a sutler , and took the command himself and brushed the whole paynim outfit into the sea like flies and come back across the world in a glory like sunset .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 26]: But he said we did n't know enough to take the chance when we had it , and he would n't ever offer it again .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 5]: And he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 12]: When he once got set , you could n't budge him .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 7]: But I did n't care much .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 20]: I am peaceable , and do n't get up rows with people that ai n't doing nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 19]: I allowed if the paynim was satisfied I was , and we would let it stand at that .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 20]: Now Tom he got all that notion out of Walter Scott 's book , which he was always reading .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 34]: And it WAS a wild notion , because in my opinion he never could 've raised the men , and if he did , as like as not he would 've got licked .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 38]: I took the book and read all about it , and as near as I could make it out , most of the folks that shook farming to go crusading had a mighty rocky time of it .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 31]: THE BALLOON ASCENSION WELL , Tom got up one thing after another , but they all had tender spots about 'em somewheres , and he had to shove 'em aside .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 9]: So at last he was about in despair .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 47]: Then the St. Louis papers begun to talk a good deal about the balloon that was going to sail to Europe , and Tom sort of thought he wanted to go down and see what it looked like , but could n't make up his mind .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 54]: But the papers went on talking , and so he allowed that maybe if he did n't go he might n't ever have another chance to see a balloon ; and next , he found out that Nat Parsons was going down to see it , and that decided him , of course .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 27]: He was n't going to have Nat Parsons coming back bragging about seeing the balloon , and him having to listen to it and keep quiet .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 14]: So he wanted me and Jim to go too , and we went .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 29]: It was a noble big balloon , and had wings and fans and all sorts of things , and was n't like any balloon you see in pictures .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 69]: It was away out toward the edge of town , in a vacant lot , corner of Twelfth street ; and there was a big crowd around it , making fun of it , and making fun of the man , -- a lean pale feller with that soft kind of moonlight in his eyes , you know , -- and they kept saying it would n't go .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 91]: It made him hot to hear them , and he would turn on them and shake his fist and say they was animals and blind , but some day they would find they had stood face to face with one of the men that lifts up nations and makes civilizations , and was too dull to know it ; and right here on this spot their own children and grandchildren would build a monument to him that would outlast a thousand years , but his name would outlast the monument .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 74]: And then the crowd would burst out in a laugh again , and yell at him , and ask him what was his name before he was married , and what he would take to not do it , and what was his sister 's cat 's grandmother 's name , and all the things that a crowd says when they 've got hold of a feller that they see they can plague .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 61]: Well , some things they said WAS funny , -- yes , and mighty witty too , I ai n't denying that , -- but all the same it war n't fair nor brave , all them people pitching on one , and they so glib and sharp , and him without any gift of talk to answer back with .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 5]: But , good land !
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 9]: what did he want to sass back for ?
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 19]: You see , it could n't do him no good , and it was just nuts for them .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 7]: They HAD him , you know .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 6]: But that was his way .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 16]: I reckon he could n't help it ; he was made so , I judge .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 34]: He was a good enough sort of cretur , and had n't no harm in him , and was just a genius , as the papers said , which was n't his fault .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 18]: We ca n't all be sound : we 've got to be the way we 're made .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 47]: As near as I can make out , geniuses think they know it all , and so they wo n't take people 's advice , but always go their own way , which makes everybody forsake them and despise them , and that is perfectly natural .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 19]: If they was humbler , and listened and tried to learn , it would be better for them .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 48]: The part the professor was in was like a boat , and was big and roomy , and had water-tight lockers around the inside to keep all sorts of things in , and a body could sit on them , and make beds on them , too .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 25]: We went aboard , and there was twenty people there , snooping around and examining , and old Nat Parsons was there , too .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 29]: The professor kept fussing around getting ready , and the people went ashore , drifting out one at a time , and old Nat he was the last .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 14]: Of course it would n't do to let him go out behind US .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 16]: We must n't budge till he was gone , so we could be last ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 15]: But he was gone now , so it was time for us to follow .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 21]: I heard a big shout , and turned around -- the city was dropping from under us like a shot !
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 12]: It made me sick all through , I was so scared .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 21]: Jim turned gray and could n't say a word , and Tom did n't say nothing , but looked excited .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 32]: The city went on dropping down , and down , and down ; but we did n't seem to be doing nothing but just hang in the air and stand still .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 98]: The houses got smaller and smaller , and the city pulled itself together , closer and closer , and the men and wagons got to looking like ants and bugs crawling around , and the streets like threads and cracks ; and then it all kind of melted together , and there was n't any city any more it was only a big scar on the earth , and it seemed to me a body could see up the river and down the river about a thousand miles , though of course it was n't so much .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 33]: By and by the earth was a ball -- just a round ball , of a dull color , with shiny stripes wriggling and winding around over it , which was rivers .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 59]: The Widder Douglas always told me the earth was round like a ball , but I never took any stock in a lot of them superstitions o ' hers , and of course I paid no attention to that one , because I could see myself that the world was the shape of a plate , and flat .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 49]: I used to go up on the hill , and take a look around and prove it for myself , because I reckon the best way to get a sure thing on a fact is to go and examine for yourself , and not take anybody 's say-so .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 13]: But I had to give in now that the widder was right .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 44]: That is , she was right as to the rest of the world , but she war n't right about the part our village is in ; that part is the shape of a plate , and flat , I take my oath !
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 27]: The professor had been quiet all this time , as if he was asleep ; but he broke loose now , and he was mighty bitter .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 9]: He says something like this : `` Idiots !
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 27]: They said it would n't go ; and they wanted to examine it , and spy around and get the secret of it out of me .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 5]: But I beat them .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 7]: Nobody knows the secret but me .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 30]: Nobody knows what makes it move but me ; and it 's a new power -- a new power , and a thousand times the strongest in the earth !
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 6]: Steam 's foolishness to it !
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 9]: They said I could n't go to Europe .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 3]: To Europe !
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 17]: Why , there 's power aboard to last five years , and feed for three months .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 4]: They are fools !
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 7]: What do they know about it ?
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 10]: Yes , and they said my air-ship was flimsy .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 9]: Why , she 's good for fifty years !
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 31]: I can sail the skies all my life if I want to , and steer where I please , though they laughed at that , and said I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 4]: Could n't steer !
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 9]: Come here , boy ; we 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 10]: You press these buttons as I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 32]: He made Tom steer the ship all about and every which way , and learnt him the whole thing in nearly no time ; and Tom said it was perfectly easy .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 64]: He made him fetch the ship down ` most to the earth , and had him spin her along so close to the Illinois prairies that a body could talk to the farmers , and hear everything they said perfectly plain ; and he flung out printed bills to them that told about the balloon , and said it was going to Europe .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 31]: Tom got so he could steer straight for a tree till he got nearly to it , and then dart up and skin right along over the top of it .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 31]: Yes , and he showed Tom how to land her ; and he done it first-rate , too , and set her down in the prairies as soft as wool .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 20]: But the minute we started to skip out the professor says , `` No , you do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 9]: and shot her up in the air again .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 4]: It was awful .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 40]: I begun to beg , and so did Jim ; but it only give his temper a rise , and he begun to rage around and look wild out of his eyes , and I was scared of him .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 41]: Well , then he got on to his troubles again , and mourned and grumbled about the way he was treated , and could n't seem to git over it , and especially people 's saying his ship was flimsy .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 22]: He scoffed at that , and at their saying she war n't simple and would be always getting out of order .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 5]: Get out of order !
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 21]: That graveled him ; he said that she could n't any more get out of order than the solar sister .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 16]: He got worse and worse , and I never see a person take on so .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 16]: It give me the cold shivers to see him , and so it did Jim .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 33]: By and by he got to yelling and screaming , and then he swore the world should n't ever have his secret at all now , it had treated him so mean .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 38]: He said he would sail his balloon around the globe just to show what he could do , and then he would sink it in the sea , and sink us all along with it , too .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 18]: Well , it was the awfulest fix to be in , and here was night coming on !
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 63]: He give us something to eat , and made us go to the other end of the boat , and he laid down on a locker , where he could boss all the works , and put his old pepper-box revolver under his head , and said if anybody come fooling around there trying to land her , he would kill him .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 41]: We set scrunched up together , and thought considerable , but did n't say much -- only just a word once in a while when a body had to say something or bust , we was so scared and worried .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 8]: The night dragged along slow and lonesome .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 43]: We was pretty low down , and the moonshine made everything soft and pretty , and the farmhouses looked snug and homeful , and we could hear the farm sounds , and wished we could be down there ; but , laws !
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 16]: we just slipped along over them like a ghost , and never left a track .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 65]: Away in the night , when all the sounds was late sounds , and the air had a late feel , and a late smell , too -- about a two-o'clock feel , as near as I could make out -- Tom said the professor was so quiet this time he must be asleep , and we 'd better -- `` Better what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 21]: I says in a whisper , and feeling sick all over , because I knowed what he was thinking about .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 18]: `` Better slip back there and tie him , and land the ship , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 8]: I says : `` No , sir !
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 9]: Don ' you budge , Tom Sawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 17]: And Jim -- well , Jim was kind o ' gasping , he was so scared .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 12]: He says : `` Oh , Mars Tom , DO N'T !
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 15]: Ef you teches him , we 's gone -- we 's gone sho ' !
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 16]: I ai n't gwine anear him , not for nothin ' in dis worl ' .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 9]: Mars Tom , he 's plumb crazy . ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 16]: Tom whispers and says -- `` That 's WHY we 've got to do something .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 55]: If he was n't crazy I would n't give shucks to be anywhere but here ; you could n't hire me to get out -- now that I 've got used to this balloon and over the scare of being cut loose from the solid ground -- if he was in his right mind .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 35]: But it 's no good politics , sailing around like this with a person that 's out of his head , and says he 's going round the world and then drown us all .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 30]: We 've GOT to do something , I tell you , and do it before he wakes up , too , or we may n't ever get another chance .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 22]: But it made us turn cold and creepy just to think of it , and we said we would n't budge .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 24]: So Tom was for slipping back there by himself to see if he could n't get at the steering-gear and land the ship .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 42]: We begged and begged him not to , but it war n't no use ; so he got down on his hands and knees , and begun to crawl an inch at a time , we a-holding our breath and watching .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 24]: After he got to the middle of the boat he crept slower than ever , and it did seem like years to me .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 30]: But at last we see him get to the professor 's head , and sort of raise up soft and look a good spell in his face and listen .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 19]: Then we see him begin to inch along again toward the professor 's feet where the steering-buttons was .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 46]: Well , he got there all safe , and was reaching slow and steady toward the buttons , but he knocked down something that made a noise , and we see him slump down flat an ' soft in the bottom , and lay still .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 13]: The professor stirred , and says , `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 44]: But everybody kept dead still and quiet , and he begun to mutter and mumble and nestle , like a person that 's going to wake up , and I thought I was going to die , I was so worried and scared .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 19]: Then a cloud slid over the moon , and I ` most cried , I was so glad .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 21]: She buried herself deeper and deeper into the cloud , and it got so dark we could n't see Tom .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 24]: Then it began to sprinkle rain , and we could hear the professor fussing at his ropes and things and abusing the weather .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 70]: We was afraid every minute he would touch Tom , and then we would be goners , and no help ; but Tom was already on his way back , and when we felt his hands on our knees my breath stopped sudden , and my heart fell down ` mongst my other works , because I could n't tell in the dark but it might be the professor !
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 6]: which I thought it WAS .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 2]: Dear !
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 33]: I was so glad to have him back that I was just as near happy as a person could be that was up in the air that way with a deranged man .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 38]: You ca n't land a balloon in the dark , and so I hoped it would keep on raining , for I did n't want Tom to go meddling any more and make us so awful uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 7]: Well , I got my wish .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 60]: It drizzled and drizzled along the rest of the night , which was n't long , though it did seem so ; and at daybreak it cleared , and the world looked mighty soft and gray and pretty , and the forests and fields so good to see again , and the horses and cattle standing sober and thinking .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 30]: Next , the sun come a-blazing up gay and splendid , and then we began to feel rusty and stretchy , and first we knowed we was all asleep .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 16]: TOM EXPLAINS WE went to sleep about four o'clock , and woke up about eight .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 13]: The professor was setting back there at his end , looking glum .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 18]: He pitched us some breakfast , but he told us not to come abaft the midship compass .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 9]: That was about the middle of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 24]: Well , when you are sharp-set , and you eat and satisfy yourself , everything looks pretty different from what it done before .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 21]: It makes a body feel pretty near comfortable , even when he is up in a balloon with a genius .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 6]: We got to talking together .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 26]: There was one thing that kept bothering me , and by and by I says : `` Tom , did n't we start east ? ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 9]: `` How fast have we been going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 15]: `` Well , you heard what the professor said when he was raging round .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 66]: Sometimes , he said , we was making fifty miles an hour , sometimes ninety , sometimes a hundred ; said that with a gale to help he could make three hundred any time , and said if he wanted the gale , and wanted it blowing the right direction , he only had to go up higher or down lower to find it . ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 12]: `` Well , then , it 's just as I reckoned .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 5]: The professor lied . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 20]: `` Because if we was going so fast we ought to be past Illinois , ought n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 4]: `` Certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 8]: `` Well , we ai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 10]: `` What 's the reason we ai n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 7]: `` I know by the color .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 7]: We 're right over Illinois yet .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 14]: And you can see for yourself that Indiana ai n't in sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 12]: `` I wonder what 's the matter with you , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 7]: You know by the COLOR ? ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 9]: `` Yes , of course I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 12]: `` What 's the color got to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 10]: `` It 's got everything to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 8]: Illinois is green , Indiana is pink .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 12]: You show me any pink down here , if you can .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 9]: No , sir ; it 's green . ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 4]: `` Indiana PINK ?
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 7]: Why , what a lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 21]: `` It ai n't no lie ; I 've seen it on the map , and it 's pink . ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 10]: You never see a person so aggravated and disgusted .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 23]: He says : `` Well , if I was such a numbskull as you , Huck Finn , I would jump over .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 6]: Seen it on the map !
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 21]: Huck Finn , did you reckon the States was the same color out-of-doors as they are on the map ? ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 10]: `` Tom Sawyer , what 's a map for ?
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 9]: Ai n't it to learn you facts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 5]: `` Of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 17]: `` Well , then , how 's it going to do that if it tells lies ?
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 9]: That 's what I want to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 6]: `` Shucks , you muggins !
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 7]: It do n't tell lies . ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 10]: `` It do n't , do n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 8]: `` No , it do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 21]: `` All right , then ; if it do n't , there ai n't no two States the same color .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 12]: You git around THAT if you can , Tom Sawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 35]: He see I had him , and Jim see it too ; and I tell you , I felt pretty good , for Tom Sawyer was always a hard person to git ahead of .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 12]: Jim slapped his leg and says : `` I tell YOU !
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 10]: dat 's smart , dat 's right down smart .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 18]: Ai n't no use , Mars Tom ; he got you DIS time , sho ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 21]: He slapped his leg again , and says , `` My LAN ' , but it was smart one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 25]: I never felt so good in my life ; and yet I did n't know I was saying anything much till it was out .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 39]: I was just mooning along , perfectly careless , and not expecting anything was going to happen , and never THINKING of such a thing at all , when , all of a sudden , out it came .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 19]: Why , it was just as much a surprise to me as it was to any of them .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 38]: It was just the same way it is when a person is munching along on a hunk of corn-pone , and not thinking about anything , and all of a sudden bites into a di ` mond .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 108]: Now all that HE knows first off is that it 's some kind of gravel he 's bit into ; but he do n't find out it 's a di ` mond till he gits it out and brushes off the sand and crumbs and one thing or another , and has a look at it , and then he 's surprised and glad -- yes , and proud too ; though when you come to look the thing straight in the eye , he ai n't entitled to as much credit as he would ` a ' been if he 'd been HUNTING di ` monds .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 12]: You can see the difference easy if you think it over .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 24]: You see , an accident , that way , ai n't fairly as big a thing as a thing that 's done a-purpose .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 30]: Anybody could find that di ` mond in that corn-pone ; but mind you , it 's got to be somebody that 's got THAT KIND OF A CORN-PONE .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 21]: That 's where that feller 's credit comes in , you see ; and that 's where mine comes in .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 34]: I do n't claim no great things -- I do n't reckon I could ` a ' done it again -- but I done it that time ; that 's all I claim .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 32]: And I had n't no more idea I could do such a thing , and war n't any more thinking about it or trying to , than you be this minute .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 31]: Why , I was just as ca 'm , a body could n't be any ca ` mer , and yet , all of a sudden , out it come .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 27]: I 've often thought of that time , and I can remember just the way everything looked , same as if it was only last week .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 67]: I can see it all : beautiful rolling country with woods and fields and lakes for hundreds and hundreds of miles all around , and towns and villages scattered everywheres under us , here and there and yonder ; and the professor mooning over a chart on his little table , and Tom 's cap flopping in the rigging where it was hung up to dry .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 97]: And one thing in particular was a bird right alongside , not ten foot off , going our way and trying to keep up , but losing ground all the time ; and a railroad train doing the same thing down there , sliding among the trees and farms , and pouring out a long cloud of black smoke and now and then a little puff of white ; and when the white was gone so long you had almost forgot it , you would hear a little faint toot , and that was the whistle .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 22]: And we left the bird and the train both behind , ` WAY behind , and done it easy , too .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 46]: But Tom he was huffy , and said me and Jim was a couple of ignorant blatherskites , and then he says : `` Suppose there 's a brown calf and a big brown dog , and an artist is making a picture of them .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 13]: What is the MAIN thing that that artist has got to do ?
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 23]: He has got to paint them so you can tell them apart the minute you look at them , hai n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 3]: Of course .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 17]: Well , then , do you want him to go and paint BOTH of them brown ?
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 5]: Certainly you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 16]: He paints one of them blue , and then you ca n't make no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 9]: It 's just the same with the maps .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 28]: That 's why they make every State a different color ; it ai n't to deceive you , it 's to keep you from deceiving yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 15]: But I could n't see no argument about that , and neither could Jim .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 44]: Jim shook his head , and says : `` Why , Mars Tom , if you knowed what chuckle-heads dem painters is , you 'd wait a long time before you 'd fetch one er DEM in to back up a fac ' .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 16]: I 's gwine to tell you , den you kin see for you ` self .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 50]: I see one of 'em a-paintin ' away , one day , down in ole Hank Wilson 's back lot , en I went down to see , en he was paintin ' dat old brindle cow wid de near horn gone -- you knows de one I means .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 29]: En I ast him what he 's paintin ' her for , en he say when he git her painted , de picture 's wuth a hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 18]: Mars Tom , he could a got de cow fer fifteen , en I tole him so .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 29]: Well , sah , if you 'll b ` lieve me , he jes ' shuck his head , dat painter did , en went on a-dobbin ' .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 14]: Bless you , Mars Tom , DEY do n't know nothin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 5]: Tom lost his temper .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 17]: I notice a person ` most always does that 's got laid out in an argument .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 14]: He told us to shut up , and maybe we 'd feel better .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 51]: Then he see a town clock away off down yonder , and he took up the glass and looked at it , and then looked at his silver turnip , and then at the clock , and then at the turnip again , and says : `` That 's funny !
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 10]: That clock 's near about an hour fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 7]: So he put up his turnip .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 19]: Then he see another clock , and took a look , and it was an hour fast too .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 4]: That puzzled him .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 12]: `` That 's a mighty curious thing , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 8]: `` I do n't understand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 21]: Then he took the glass and hunted up another clock , and sure enough it was an hour fast too .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 30]: Then his eyes began to spread and his breath to come out kinder gaspy like , and he says : `` Ger-reat Scott , it 's the LONGITUDE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 19]: I says , considerably scared : `` Well , what 's been and gone and happened now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 42]: `` Why , the thing that 's happened is that this old bladder has slid over Illinois and Indiana and Ohio like nothing , and this is the east end of Pennsylvania or New York , or somewheres around there . ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 11]: `` Tom Sawyer , you do n't mean it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 12]: `` Yes , I do , and it 's dead sure .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 22]: We 've covered about fifteen degrees of longitude since we left St. Louis yesterday afternoon , and them clocks are right .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 11]: We 've come close on to eight hundred miles . ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 20]: I did n't believe it , but it made the cold streaks trickle down my back just the same .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 24]: In my experience I knowed it would n't take much short of two weeks to do it down the Mississippi on a raft .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 8]: Jim was working his mind and studying .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 18]: Pretty soon he says : `` Mars Tom , did you say dem clocks uz right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 8]: `` Yes , they 're right . ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 11]: `` Ai n't yo ' watch right , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 18]: `` She 's right for St. Louis , but she 's an hour wrong for here . ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 21]: `` Mars Tom , is you tryin ' to let on dat de time ai n't de SAME everywheres ? ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 16]: `` No , it ai n't the same everywheres , by a long shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 41]: Jim looked distressed , and says : `` It grieves me to hear you talk like dat , Mars Tom ; I 's right down ashamed to hear you talk like dat , arter de way you 's been raised .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 16]: Yassir , it 'd break yo ' Aunt Polly 's heart to hear you . ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 4]: Tom was astonished .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 31]: He looked Jim over wondering , and did n't say nothing , and Jim went on : `` Mars Tom , who put de people out yonder in St. Louis ?
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 5]: De Lord done it .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 9]: Who put de people here whar we is ?
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 5]: De Lord done it .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 7]: Ain ' dey bofe his children ?
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 5]: ` Cose dey is .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 4]: WELL , den !
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 10]: is he gwine to SCRIMINATE ` twixt 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 3]: `` Scriminate !
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 6]: I never heard such ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 8]: There ai n't no discriminating about it .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 27]: When he makes you and some more of his children black , and makes the rest of us white , what do you call that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 7]: Jim see the p ` int .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 4]: He was stuck .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 5]: He could n't answer .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 32]: Tom says : `` He does discriminate , you see , when he wants to ; but this case HERE ai n't no discrimination of his , it 's man 's .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 28]: The Lord made the day , and he made the night ; but he did n't invent the hours , and he did n't distribute them around .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 5]: Man did that . ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 8]: `` Mars Tom , is dat so ?
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 5]: Man done it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 4]: `` Certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 8]: `` Who tole him he could ? ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 3]: `` Nobody .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 5]: He never asked . ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 16]: Jim studied a minute , and says : `` Well , dat do beat me .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 11]: I would n't ` a ' tuck no sich resk .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 11]: But some people ai n't scared o ' nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 12]: Dey bangs right ahead ; DEY do n't care what happens .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 17]: So den dey 's allays an hour 's diff ` unce everywhah , Mars Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 4]: `` An hour ?
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 14]: It 's four minutes difference for every degree of longitude , you know .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 18]: Fifteen of 'em 's an hour , thirty of 'em 's two hours , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 22]: When it 's one clock Tuesday morning in England , it 's eight o'clock the night before in New York . ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 17]: Jim moved a little way along the locker , and you could see he was insulted .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 52]: He kept shaking his head and muttering , and so I slid along to him and patted him on the leg , and petted him up , and got him over the worst of his feelings , and then he says : `` Mars Tom talkin ' sich talk as dat !
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 17]: Choosday in one place en Monday in t ` other , bofe in the same day !
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 16]: Huck , dis ai n't no place to joke -- up here whah we is .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 6]: Two days in one day !
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 11]: How you gwine to get two days inter one day ?
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 12]: Ca n't git two hours inter one hour , kin you ?
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 13]: Ca n't git two niggers inter one nigger skin , kin you ?
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 15]: Ca n't git two gallons of whisky inter a one-gallon jug , kin you ?
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 10]: No , sir , ` twould strain de jug .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 14]: Yes , en even den you could n't , I do n't believe .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 20]: Why , looky here , Huck , s ` posen de Choosday was New Year 's -- now den !
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 29]: is you gwine to tell me it 's dis year in one place en las ' year in t ` other , bofe in de identical same minute ?
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 6]: It 's de beatenest rubbage !
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 20]: I ca n't stan ' it -- I ca n't stan ' to hear tell ` bout it . ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 20]: Then he begun to shiver and turn gray , and Tom says : `` NOW what 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 6]: What 's the trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 25]: Jim could hardly speak , but he says : `` Mars Tom , you ai n't jokin ' , en it 's SO ? ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 13]: `` No , I 'm not , and it is so . ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 38]: Jim shivered again , and says : `` Den dat Monday could be de las ' day , en dey would n't be no las ' day in England , en de dead would n't be called .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 10]: We must n't go over dah , Mars Tom .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 35]: Please git him to turn back ; I wants to be whah -- '' All of a sudden we see something , and all jumped up , and forgot everything and begun to gaze .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 27]: Tom says : `` Ai n't that the -- '' He catched his breath , then says : `` It IS , sure as you live !
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 6]: It 's the ocean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 11]: That made me and Jim catch our breath , too .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 23]: Then we all stood petrified but happy , for none of us had ever seen an ocean , or ever expected to .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 10]: Tom kept muttering : `` Atlantic Ocean -- Atlantic .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 8]: Land , do n't it sound great !
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 14]: And that 's IT -- and WE are looking at it -- we !
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 11]: Why , it 's just too splendid to believe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 91]: Then we see a big bank of black smoke ; and when we got nearer , it was a city -- and a monster she was , too , with a thick fringe of ships around one edge ; and we wondered if it was New York , and begun to jaw and dispute about it , and , first we knowed , it slid from under us and went flying behind , and here we was , out over the very ocean itself , and going like a cyclone .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 9]: Then we woke up , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 48]: We made a break aft and raised a wail , and begun to beg the professor to turn back and land us , but he jerked out his pistol and motioned us back , and we went , but nobody will ever know how bad we felt .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 126]: The land was gone , all but a little streak , like a snake , away off on the edge of the water , and down under us was just ocean , ocean , ocean -- millions of miles of it , heaving and pitching and squirming , and white sprays blowing from the wave-tops , and only a few ships in sight , wallowing around and laying over , first on one side and then on t ` other , and sticking their bows under and then their sterns ; and before long there war n't no ships at all , and we had the sky and the whole ocean all to ourselves , and the roomiest place I ever see and the lonesomest .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 8]: STORM AND it got lonesomer and lonesomer .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 28]: There was the big sky up there , empty and awful deep ; and the ocean down there without a thing on it but just the waves .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 40]: All around us was a ring , where the sky and the water come together ; yes , a monstrous big ring it was , and we right in the dead center of it -- plumb in the center .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 28]: We was racing along like a prairie fire , but it never made any difference , we could n't seem to git past that center no way .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 14]: I could n't see that we ever gained an inch on that ring .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 14]: It made a body feel creepy , it was so curious and unaccountable .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 64]: Well , everything was so awful still that we got to talking in a very low voice , and kept on getting creepier and lonesomer and less and less talky , till at last the talk ran dry altogether , and we just set there and `` thunk , '' as Jim calls it , and never said a word the longest time .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 44]: The professor never stirred till the sun was overhead , then he stood up and put a kind of triangle to his eye , and Tom said it was a sextant and he was taking the sun to see whereabouts the balloon was .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 20]: Then he ciphered a little and looked in a book , and then he begun to carry on again .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 36]: He said lots of wild things , and , among others , he said he would keep up this hundred-mile gait till the middle of to-morrow afternoon , and then he 'd land in London .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 8]: We said we would be humbly thankful .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 36]: He was turning away , but he whirled around when we said that , and give us a long look of his blackest kind -- one of the maliciousest and suspiciousest looks I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 11]: Then he says : `` You want to leave me .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 8]: Do n't try to deny it . ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 20]: We did n't know what to say , so we held in and did n't say nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 21]: He went aft and set down , but he could n't seem to git that thing out of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 25]: Every now and then he would rip out something about it , and try to make us answer him , but we das n't .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 20]: It got lonesomer and lonesomer right along , and it did seem to me I could n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 11]: It was still worse when night begun to come on .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 13]: By and by Tom pinched me and whispers : `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 18]: I took a glance aft , and see the professor taking a whet out of a bottle .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 9]: I did n't like the looks of that .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 16]: By and by he took another drink , and pretty soon he begun to sing .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 11]: It was dark now , and getting black and stormy .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 33]: He went on singing , wilder and wilder , and the thunder begun to mutter , and the wind to wheeze and moan among the ropes , and altogether it was awful .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 24]: It got so black we could n't see him any more , and wished we could n't hear him , but we could .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 35]: Then he got still ; but he war n't still ten minutes till we got suspicious , and wished he would start up his noise again , so we could tell where he was .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 26]: By and by there was a flash of lightning , and we see him start to get up , but he staggered and fell down .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 19]: We heard him scream out in the dark : `` They do n't want to go to England .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 9]: All right , I 'll change the course .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 6]: They want to leave me .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 5]: I know they do .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 9]: Well , they shall -- and NOW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 9]: I ` most died when he said that .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 29]: Then he was still again -- still so long I could n't bear it , and it did seem to me the lightning would n't EVER come again .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 28]: But at last there was a blessed flash , and there he was , on his hands and knees crawling , and not four feet from us .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 8]: My , but his eyes was terrible !
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 16]: He made a lunge for Tom , and says , `` Overboard YOU go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 27]: but it was already pitch-dark again , and I could n't see whether he got him or not , and Tom did n't make a sound .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 28]: There was another long , horrible wait ; then there was a flash , and I see Tom 's head sink down outside the boat and disappear .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 15]: He was on the rope-ladder that dangled down in the air from the gunnel .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 36]: The professor let off a shout and jumped for him , and straight off it was pitch-dark again , and Jim groaned out , `` Po ' Mars Tom , he 's a goner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 15]: and made a jump for the professor , but the professor war n't there .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 46]: Then we heard a couple of terrible screams , and then another not so loud , and then another that was ` way below , and you could only JUST hear it ; and I heard Jim say , `` Po ' Mars Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 24]: Then it was awful still , and I reckon a person could ` a ' counted four thousand before the next flash come .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 28]: When it come I see Jim on his knees , with his arms on the locker and his face buried in them , and he was crying .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 26]: Before I could look over the edge it was all dark again , and I was glad , because I did n't want to see .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 30]: But when the next flash come , I was watching , and down there I see somebody a-swinging in the wind on the ladder , and it was Tom !
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 5]: `` Come up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 10]: I shouts ; `` come up , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 32]: His voice was so weak , and the wind roared so , I could n't make out what he said , but I thought he asked was the professor up there .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 13]: I shouts : `` No , he 's down in the ocean !
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 3]: Come up !
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 6]: Can we help you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 9]: Of course , all this in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 11]: `` Huck , who is you hollerin ' at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 9]: `` I 'm hollerin ' at Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 83]: `` Oh , Huck , how kin you act so , when you know po ' Mars Tom -- '' Then he let off an awful scream , and flung his head and his arms back and let off another one , because there was a white glare just then , and he had raised up his face just in time to see Tom 's , as white as snow , rise above the gunnel and look him right in the eye .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 11]: He thought it was Tom 's ghost , you see .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 44]: Tom clumb aboard , and when Jim found it WAS him , and not his ghost , he hugged him , and called him all sorts of loving names , and carried on like he was gone crazy , he was so glad .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 12]: Says I : `` What did you wait for , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 10]: Why did n't you come up at first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 7]: `` I das n't , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 20]: I knowed somebody plunged down past me , but I did n't know who it was in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 17]: It could ` a ' been you , it could ` a ' been Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 11]: That was the way with Tom Sawyer -- always sound .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 13]: He war n't coming up till he knowed where the professor was .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 46]: The storm let go about this time with all its might ; and it was dreadful the way the thunder boomed and tore , and the lightning glared out , and the wind sung and screamed in the rigging , and the rain come down .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 42]: One second you could n't see your hand before you , and the next you could count the threads in your coat-sleeve , and see a whole wide desert of waves pitching and tossing through a kind of veil of rain .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 46]: A storm like that is the loveliest thing there is , but it ai n't at its best when you are up in the sky and lost , and it 's wet and lonesome , and there 's just been a death in the family .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 70]: We set there huddled up in the bow , and talked low about the poor professor ; and everybody was sorry for him , and sorry the world had made fun of him and treated him so harsh , when he was doing the best he could , and had n't a friend nor nobody to encourage him and keep him from brooding his mind away and going deranged .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 29]: There was plenty of clothes and blankets and everything at the other end , but we thought we 'd ruther take the rain than go meddling back there .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 19]: CHAPTER V. LAND WE tried to make some plans , but we could n't come to no agreement .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 61]: Me and Jim was for turning around and going back home , but Tom allowed that by the time daylight come , so we could see our way , we would be so far toward England that we might as well go there , and come back in a ship , and have the glory of saying we done it .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 45]: About midnight the storm quit and the moon come out and lit up the ocean , and we begun to feel comfortable and drowsy ; so we stretched out on the lockers and went to sleep , and never woke up again till sun-up .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 25]: The sea was sparkling like di ` monds , and it was nice weather , and pretty soon our things was all dry again .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 31]: We went aft to find some breakfast , and the first thing we noticed was that there was a dim light burning in a compass back there under a hood .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 5]: Then Tom was disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 13]: He says : `` You know what that means , easy enough .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 37]: It means that somebody has got to stay on watch and steer this thing the same as he would a ship , or she 'll wander around and go wherever the wind wants her to . ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 24]: `` Well , '' I says , `` what 's she been doing since -- er -- since we had the accident ? ''
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 17]: `` Wandering , '' he says , kinder troubled -- `` wandering , without any doubt .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 14]: She 's in a wind now that 's blowing her south of east .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 15]: We do n't know how long that 's been going on , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 23]: So then he p ` inted her east , and said he would hold her there till we rousted out the breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 21]: The professor had laid in everything a body could want ; he could n't ` a ' been better fixed .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 99]: There was n't no milk for the coffee , but there was water , and everything else you could want , and a charcoal stove and the fixings for it , and pipes and cigars and matches ; and wine and liquor , which war n't in our line ; and books , and maps , and charts , and an accordion ; and furs , and blankets , and no end of rubbish , like brass beads and brass jewelry , which Tom said was a sure sign that he had an idea of visiting among savages .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 6]: There was money , too .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 9]: Yes , the professor was well enough fixed .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 133]: After breakfast Tom learned me and Jim how to steer , and divided us all up into four-hour watches , turn and turn about ; and when his watch was out I took his place , and he got out the professor 's papers and pens and wrote a letter home to his aunt Polly , telling her everything that had happened to us , and dated it `` IN THE WELKIN , APPROACHING ENGLAND , '' and folded it together and stuck it fast with a red wafer , and directed it , and wrote above the direction , in big writing , `` FROM TOM SAWYER , THE ERRONORT , '' and said it would stump old Nat Parsons , the postmaster , when it come along in the mail .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 19]: I says : `` Tom Sawyer , this ai n't no welkin , it 's a balloon . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 15]: `` Well , now , who SAID it was a welkin , smarty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 12]: `` You 've wrote it on the letter , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 5]: `` What of it ?
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 12]: That do n't mean that the balloon 's the welkin . ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 8]: `` Oh , I thought it did .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 10]: Well , then , what is a welkin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 9]: I see in a minute he was stuck .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 34]: He raked and scraped around in his mind , but he could n't find nothing , so he had to say : `` I do n't know , and nobody do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 16]: It 's just a word , and it 's a mighty good word , too .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 9]: There ai n't many that lays over it .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 11]: I do n't believe there 's ANY that does . ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 4]: `` Shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 3]: I says .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 7]: `` But what does it MEAN ?
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 9]: -- that 's the p ` int . ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 13]: `` I do n't know what it means , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 17]: It 's a word that people uses for -- for -- well , it 's ornamental .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 18]: They do n't put ruffles on a shirt to keep a person warm , do they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 7]: `` Course they do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 12]: `` But they put them ON , do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 24]: `` All right , then ; that letter I wrote is a shirt , and the welkin 's the ruffle on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 12]: I judged that that would gravel Jim , and it did .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 24]: `` Now , Mars Tom , it ai n't no use to talk like dat ; en , moreover , it 's sinful .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 20]: You knows a letter ai n't no shirt , en dey ai n't no ruffles on it , nuther .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 27]: Dey ai n't no place to put 'em on ; you ca n't put em on , and dey would n't stay ef you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 19]: `` Oh DO shut up , and wait till something 's started that you know something about . ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 51]: `` Why , Mars Tom , sholy you ca n't mean to say I do n't know about shirts , when , goodness knows , I 's toted home de washin ' ever sence -- '' `` I tell you , this has n't got anything to do with shirts .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 29]: I only -- '' `` Why , Mars Tom , you said yo ` self dat a letter -- '' `` Do you want to drive me crazy ?
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 3]: Keep still .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 9]: I only used it as a metaphor . ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 10]: That word kinder bricked us up for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 26]: Then Jim says -- rather timid , because he see Tom was getting pretty tetchy : `` Mars Tom , what is a metaphor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 21]: `` A metaphor 's a -- well , it 's a -- a -- a metaphor 's an illustration . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 13]: He see THAT did n't git home , so he tried again .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 29]: `` When I say birds of a feather flocks together , it 's a metaphorical way of saying -- '' `` But dey DO N'T , Mars Tom .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 10]: No , sir , ` deed dey do n't .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 39]: Dey ai n't no feathers dat 's more alike den a bluebird en a jaybird , but ef you waits till you catches dem birds together , you 'll -- '' `` Oh , give us a rest !
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 13]: You ca n't get the simplest little thing through your thick skull .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 9]: Now do n't bother me any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 6]: Jim was satisfied to stop .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 11]: He was dreadful pleased with himself for catching Tom out .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 28]: The minute Tom begun to talk about birds I judged he was a goner , because Jim knowed more about birds than both of us put together .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 23]: You see , he had killed hundreds and hundreds of them , and that 's the way to find out about birds .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 38]: That 's the way people does that writes books about birds , and loves them so that they 'll go hungry and tired and take any amount of trouble to find a new bird and kill it .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 149]: Their name is ornithologers , and I could have been an ornithologer myself , because I always loved birds and creatures ; and I started out to learn how to be one , and I see a bird setting on a limb of a high tree , singing with its head tilted back and its mouth open , and before I thought I fired , and his song stopped and he fell straight down from the limb , all limp like a rag , and I run and picked him up and he was dead , and his body was warm in my hand , and his head rolled about this way and that , like his neck was broke , and there was a little white skin over his eyes , and one little drop of blood on the side of his head ; and , laws !
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 34]: I could n't see nothing more for the tears ; and I hai n't never murdered no creature since that war n't doing me no harm , and I ai n't going to .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 8]: But I was aggravated about that welkin .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 5]: I wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 17]: I got the subject up again , and then Tom explained , the best he could .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 22]: He said when a person made a big speech the newspapers said the shouts of the people made the welkin ring .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 28]: He said they always said that , but none of them ever told what it was , so he allowed it just meant outdoors and up high .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 16]: Well , that seemed sensible enough , so I was satisfied , and said so .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 34]: That pleased Tom and put him in a good humor again , and he says : `` Well , it 's all right , then ; and we 'll let bygones be bygones .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 33]: I do n't know for certain what a welkin is , but when we land in London we 'll make it ring , anyway , and do n't you forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 66]: He said an erronort was a person who sailed around in balloons ; and said it was a mighty sight finer to be Tom Sawyer the Erronort than to be Tom Sawyer the Traveler , and we would be heard of all round the world , if we pulled through all right , and so he would n't give shucks to be a traveler now .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 37]: Toward the middle of the afternoon we got everything ready to land , and we felt pretty good , too , and proud ; and we kept watching with the glasses , like Columbus discovering America .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 9]: But we could n't see nothing but ocean .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 19]: The afternoon wasted out and the sun shut down , and still there war n't no land anywheres .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 43]: We wondered what was the matter , but reckoned it would come out all right , so we went on steering east , but went up on a higher level so we would n't hit any steeples or mountains in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 41]: It was my watch till midnight , and then it was Jim 's ; but Tom stayed up , because he said ship captains done that when they was making the land , and did n't stand no regular watch .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 44]: Well , when daylight come , Jim give a shout , and we jumped up and looked over , and there was the land sure enough -- land all around , as far as you could see , and perfectly level and yaller .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 12]: We did n't know how long we 'd been over it .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 26]: There war n't no trees , nor hills , nor rocks , nor towns , and Tom and Jim had took it for the sea .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 50]: They took it for the sea in a dead ca 'm ; but we was so high up , anyway , that if it had been the sea and rough , it would ` a ' looked smooth , all the same , in the night , that way .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 46]: We was all in a powerful excitement now , and grabbed the glasses and hunted everywheres for London , but could n't find hair nor hide of it , nor any other settlement -- nor any sign of a lake or a river , either .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 5]: Tom was clean beat .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 23]: He said it war n't his notion of England ; he thought England looked like America , and always had that idea .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 20]: So he said we better have breakfast , and then drop down and inquire the quickest way to London .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 12]: We cut the breakfast pretty short , we was so impatient .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 20]: As we slanted along down , the weather began to moderate , and pretty soon we shed our furs .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 19]: But it kept ON moderating , and in a precious little while it was ` most too moderate .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 10]: We was close down now , and just blistering !
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 31]: We settled down to within thirty foot of the land -- that is , it was land if sand is land ; for this was n't anything but pure sand .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 39]: Tom and me clumb down the ladder and took a run to stretch our legs , and it felt amazing good -- that is , the stretching did , but the sand scorched our feet like hot embers .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 35]: Next , we see somebody coming , and started to meet him ; but we heard Jim shout , and looked around and he was fairly dancing , and making signs , and yelling .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 25]: We could n't make out what he said , but we was scared anyway , and begun to heel it back to the balloon .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 20]: When we got close enough , we understood the words , and they made me sick : `` Run !
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 7]: Run fo ' yo ' life !
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 13]: Hit 's a lion ; I kin see him thoo de glass !
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 14]: Run , boys ; do please heel it de bes ' you kin .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 19]: He 's bu ` sted outen de menagerie , en dey ai n't nobody to stop him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 16]: It made Tom fly , but it took the stiffening all out of my legs .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 22]: I could only just gasp along the way you do in a dream when there 's a ghost gaining on you .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 34]: Tom got to the ladder and shinned up it a piece and waited for me ; and as soon as I got a foothold on it he shouted to Jim to soar away .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 15]: But Jim had clean lost his head , and said he had forgot how .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 55]: So Tom shinned along up and told me to follow ; but the lion was arriving , fetching a most ghastly roar with every lope , and my legs shook so I das n't try to take one of them out of the rounds for fear the other one would give way under me .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 37]: But Tom was aboard by this time , and he started the balloon up a little , and stopped it again as soon as the end of the ladder was ten or twelve feet above ground .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 39]: And there was the lion , a-ripping around under me , and roaring and springing up in the air at the ladder , and only missing it about a quarter of an inch , it seemed to me .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 50]: It was delicious to be out of his reach , perfectly delicious , and made me feel good and thankful all up one side ; but I was hanging there helpless and could n't climb , and that made me feel perfectly wretched and miserable all down the other .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 23]: It is most seldom that a person feels so mixed like that ; and it is not to be recommended , either .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 15]: Tom asked me what he 'd better do , but I did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 22]: He asked me if I could hold on whilst he sailed away to a safe place and left the lion behind .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 31]: I said I could if he did n't go no higher than he was now ; but if he went higher I would lose my head and fall , sure .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 15]: So he said , `` Take a good grip , '' and he started .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 11]: `` Do n't go so fast , '' I shouted .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 8]: `` It makes my head swim . ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 8]: He had started like a lightning express .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 41]: He slowed down , and we glided over the sand slower , but still in a kind of sickening way ; for it IS uncomfortable to see things sliding and gliding under you like that , and not a sound .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 16]: But pretty soon there was plenty of sound , for the lion was catching up .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 5]: His noise fetched others .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 85]: You could see them coming on the lope from every direction , and pretty soon there was a couple of dozen of them under me , jumping up at the ladder and snarling and snapping at each other ; and so we went skimming along over the sand , and these fellers doing what they could to help us to not forgit the occasion ; and then some other beasts come , without an invite , and they started a regular riot down there .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 8]: We see this plan was a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 20]: We could n't ever git away from them at this gait , and I could n't hold on forever .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 11]: So Tom took a think , and struck another idea .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 26]: That was , to kill a lion with the pepper-box revolver , and then sail away while the others stopped to fight over the carcass .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 58]: So he stopped the balloon still , and done it , and then we sailed off while the fuss was going on , and come down a quarter of a mile off , and they helped me aboard ; but by the time we was out of reach again , that gang was on hand once more .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 49]: And when they see we was really gone and they could n't get us , they sat down on their hams and looked up at us so kind of disappointed that it was as much as a person could do not to see THEIR side of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 35]: IT 'S A CARAVAN I WAS so weak that the only thing I wanted was a chance to lay down , so I made straight for my locker-bunk , and stretched myself out there .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 30]: But a body could n't get back his strength in no such oven as that , so Tom give the command to soar , and Jim started her aloft .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 31]: We had to go up a mile before we struck comfortable weather where it was breezy and pleasant and just right , and pretty soon I was all straight again .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 30]: Tom had been setting quiet and thinking ; but now he jumps up and says : `` I bet you a thousand to one I know where we are .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 13]: We 're in the Great Sahara , as sure as guns ! ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 15]: He was so excited he could n't hold still ; but I was n't .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 14]: I says : `` Well , then , where 's the Great Sahara ?
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 8]: In England or in Scotland ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 12]: ` Tai n't in either ; it 's in Africa . ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 37]: Jim 's eyes bugged out , and he begun to stare down with no end of interest , because that was where his originals come from ; but I did n't more than half believe it .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 19]: I could n't , you know ; it seemed too awful far away for us to have traveled .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 27]: But Tom was full of his discovery , as he called it , and said the lions and the sand meant the Great Desert , sure .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 45]: He said he could ` a ' found out , before we sighted land , that we was crowding the land somewheres , if he had thought of one thing ; and when we asked him what , he said : `` These clocks .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 4]: They 're chronometers .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 9]: You always read about them in sea voyages .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 21]: One of them is keeping Grinnage time , and the other is keeping St. Louis time , like my watch .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 29]: When we left St. Louis it was four in the afternoon by my watch and this clock , and it was ten at night by this Grinnage clock .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 16]: Well , at this time of the year the sun sets at about seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 37]: Now I noticed the time yesterday evening when the sun went down , and it was half-past five o'clock by the Grinnage clock , and half past 11 A.M. by my watch and the other clock .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 63]: You see , the sun rose and set by my watch in St. Louis , and the Grinnage clock was six hours fast ; but we 've come so far east that it comes within less than half an hour of setting by the Grinnage clock now , and I 'm away out -- more than four hours and a half out .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 35]: You see , that meant that we was closing up on the longitude of Ireland , and would strike it before long if we was p ` inted right -- which we was n't .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 27]: No , sir , we 've been a-wandering -- wandering ` way down south of east , and it 's my opinion we are in Africa .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 5]: Look at this map .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 13]: You see how the shoulder of Africa sticks out to the west .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 23]: Think how fast we 've traveled ; if we had gone straight east we would be long past England by this time .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 38]: You watch for noon , all of you , and we 'll stand up , and when we ca n't cast a shadow we 'll find that this Grinnage clock is coming mighty close to marking twelve .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 18]: Yes , sir , I think we 're in Africa ; and it 's just bully . ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 8]: Jim was gazing down with the glass .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 30]: He shook his head and says : `` Mars Tom , I reckon dey 's a mistake som ` er 's , hai n't seen no niggers yit . ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 13]: `` That 's nothing ; they do n't live in the desert .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 9]: What is that , ` way off yonder ?
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 6]: Gim me a glass . ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 28]: He took a long look , and said it was like a black string stretched across the sand , but he could n't guess what it was .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 82]: `` Well , '' I says , `` I reckon maybe you 've got a chance now to find out whereabouts this balloon is , because as like as not that is one of these lines here , that 's on the map , that you call meridians of longitude , and we can drop down and look at its number , and -- '' `` Oh , shucks , Huck Finn , I never see such a lunkhead as you .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 15]: Did you s ` pose there 's meridians of longitude on the EARTH ? ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 32]: `` Tom Sawyer , they 're set down on the map , and you know it perfectly well , and here they are , and you can see for yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 23]: `` Of course they 're on the map , but that 's nothing ; there ai n't any on the GROUND . ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 12]: `` Tom , do you know that to be so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 6]: `` Certainly I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 12]: `` Well , then , that map 's a liar again .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 11]: I never see such a liar as that map . ''
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 59]: He fired up at that , and I was ready for him , and Jim was warming his opinion , too , and next minute we 'd ` a ' broke loose on another argument , if Tom had n't dropped the glass and begun to clap his hands like a maniac and sing out : `` Camels !
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 4]: -- Camels ! ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 33]: So I grabbed a glass and Jim , too , and took a look , but I was disappointed , and says : `` Camels your granny ; they 're spiders . ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 9]: `` Spiders in a desert , you shad ?
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 6]: Spiders walking in a procession ?
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 22]: You do n't ever reflect , Huck Finn , and I reckon you really have n't got anything to reflect WITH .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 29]: Do n't you know we 're as much as a mile up in the air , and that that string of crawlers is two or three miles away ?
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 5]: Spiders , good land !
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 7]: Spiders as big as a cow ?
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 13]: Perhaps you 'd like to go down and milk one of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 9]: But they 're camels , just the same .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 19]: It 's a caravan , that 's what it is , and it 's a mile long . ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 14]: `` Well , then , let 's go down and look at it .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 21]: I do n't believe in it , and ai n't going to till I see it and know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 18]: `` All right , '' he says , and give the command : `` Lower away . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 85]: As we come slanting down into the hot weather , we could see that it was camels , sure enough , plodding along , an everlasting string of them , with bales strapped to them , and several hundred men in long white robes , and a thing like a shawl bound over their heads and hanging down with tassels and fringes ; and some of the men had long guns and some had n't , and some was riding and some was walking .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 11]: And the weather -- well , it was just roasting .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 8]: And how slow they did creep along !
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 20]: We swooped down now , all of a sudden , and stopped about a hundred yards over their heads .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 43]: The men all set up a yell , and some of them fell flat on their stomachs , some begun to fire their guns at us , and the rest broke and scampered every which way , and so did the camels .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 28]: We see that we was making trouble , so we went up again about a mile , to the cool weather , and watched them from there .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 38]: It took them an hour to get together and form the procession again ; then they started along , but we could see by the glasses that they was n't paying much attention to anything but us .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 72]: We poked along , looking down at them with the glasses , and by and by we see a big sand mound , and something like people the other side of it , and there was something like a man laying on top of the mound that raised his head up every now and then , and seemed to be watching the caravan or us , we did n't know which .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 69]: As the caravan got nearer , he sneaked down on the other side and rushed to the other men and horses -- for that is what they was -- and we see them mount in a hurry ; and next , here they come , like a house afire , some with lances and some with long guns , and all of them yelling the best they could .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 54]: They come a-tearing down on to the caravan , and the next minute both sides crashed together and was all mixed up , and there was such another popping of guns as you never heard , and the air got so full of smoke you could only catch glimpses of them struggling together .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 20]: There must ` a ' been six hundred men in that battle , and it was terrible to see .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 60]: Then they broke up into gangs and groups , fighting tooth and nail , and scurrying and scampering around , and laying into each other like everything ; and whenever the smoke cleared a little you could see dead and wounded people and camels scattered far and wide and all about , and camels racing off in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 33]: At last the robbers see they could n't win , so their chief sounded a signal , and all that was left of them broke away and went scampering across the plain .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 82]: The last man to go snatched up a child and carried it off in front of him on his horse , and a woman run screaming and begging after him , and followed him away off across the plain till she was separated a long ways from her people ; but it war n't no use , and she had to give it up , and we see her sink down on the sand and cover her face with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 72]: Then Tom took the hellum , and started for that yahoo , and we come a-whizzing down and made a swoop , and knocked him out of the saddle , child and all ; and he was jarred considerable , but the child was n't hurt , but laid there working its hands and legs in the air like a tumble-bug that 's on its back and ca n't turn over .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 35]: The man went staggering off to overtake his horse , and did n't know what had hit him , for we was three or four hundred yards up in the air by this time .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 17]: We judged the woman would go and get the child now ; but she did n't .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 43]: We could see her , through the glass , still setting there , with her head bowed down on her knees ; so of course she had n't seen the performance , and thought her child was clean gone with the man .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 74]: She was nearly a half a mile from her people , so we thought we might go down to the child , which was about a quarter of a mile beyond her , and snake it to her before the caravan people could git to us to do us any harm ; and besides , we reckoned they had enough business on their hands for one while , anyway , with the wounded .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 11]: We thought we 'd chance it , and we did .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 215]: We swooped down and stopped , and Jim shinned down the ladder and fetched up the kid , which was a nice fat little thing , and in a noble good humor , too , considering it was just out of a battle and been tumbled off of a horse ; and then we started for the mother , and stopped back of her and tolerable near by , and Jim slipped down and crept up easy , and when he was close back of her the child goo-goo 'd , the way a child does , and she heard it , and whirled and fetched a shriek of joy , and made a jump for the kid and snatched it and hugged it , and dropped it and hugged Jim , and then snatched off a gold chain and hung it around Jim 's neck , and hugged him again , and jerked up the child again , a-sobbing and glorifying all the time ; and Jim he shoved for the ladder and up it , and in a minute we was back up in the sky and the woman was staring up , with the back of her head between her shoulders and the child with its arms locked around her neck .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 18]: And there she stood , as long as we was in sight a-sailing away in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 8]: TOM RESPECTS THE FLEA `` NOON ! ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 8]: says Tom , and so it was .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 10]: His shadder was just a blot around his feet .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 20]: We looked , and the Grinnage clock was so close to twelve the difference did n't amount to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 61]: So Tom said London was right north of us or right south of us , one or t ` other , and he reckoned by the weather and the sand and the camels it was north ; and a good many miles north , too ; as many as from New York to the city of Mexico , he guessed .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 36]: Jim said he reckoned a balloon was a good deal the fastest thing in the world , unless it might be some kinds of birds -- a wild pigeon , maybe , or a railroad .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 45]: But Tom said he had read about railroads in England going nearly a hundred miles an hour for a little ways , and there never was a bird in the world that could do that -- except one , and that was a flea .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 4]: `` A flea ?
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 29]: Why , Mars Tom , in de fust place he ai n't a bird , strickly speakin ' -- '' `` He ai n't a bird , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 9]: Well , then , what is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 21]: `` I do n't rightly know , Mars Tom , but I speck he 's only jist a ' animal .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 21]: No , I reckon dat wo n't do , nuther , he ai n't big enough for a ' animal .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 7]: He mus ' be a bug .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 14]: Yassir , dat 's what he is , he 's a bug . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 12]: `` I bet he ai n't , but let it go .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 7]: What 's your second place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 24]: `` Well , in de second place , birds is creturs dat goes a long ways , but a flea do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 9]: `` He do n't , do n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 15]: Come , now , what IS a long distance , if you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 17]: `` Why , it 's miles , and lots of 'em -- anybody knows dat . ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 9]: `` Ca n't a man walk miles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 7]: `` Yassir , he kin . ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 8]: `` As many as a railroad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 10]: `` Yassir , if you give him time . ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 7]: `` Ca n't a flea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 18]: `` Well -- I s ` pose so -- ef you gives him heaps of time . ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 43]: `` Now you begin to see , do n't you , that DISTANCE ai n't the thing to judge by , at all ; it 's the time it takes to go the distance IN that COUNTS , ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 25]: `` Well , hit do look sorter so , but I would n't ` a ' b ` lieved it , Mars Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 44]: `` It 's a matter of PROPORTION , that 's what it is ; and when you come to gauge a thing 's speed by its size , where 's your bird and your man and your railroad , alongside of a flea ?
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 25]: The fastest man ca n't run more than about ten miles in an hour -- not much over ten thousand times his own length .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 82]: But all the books says any common ordinary third-class flea can jump a hundred and fifty times his own length ; yes , and he can make five jumps a second too -- seven hundred and fifty times his own length , in one little second -- for he do n't fool away any time stopping and starting -- he does them both at the same time ; you 'll see , if you try to put your finger on him .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 80]: Now that 's a common , ordinary , third-class flea 's gait ; but you take an Eyetalian FIRST-class , that 's been the pet of the nobility all his life , and has n't ever knowed what want or sickness or exposure was , and he can jump more than three hundred times his own length , and keep it up all day , five such jumps every second , which is fifteen hundred times his own length .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 25]: Well , suppose a man could go fifteen hundred times his own length in a second -- say , a mile and a half .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 18]: It 's ninety miles a minute ; it 's considerable more than five thousand miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 6]: Where 's your man NOW ?
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 15]: -- yes , and your bird , and your railroad , and your balloon ?
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 14]: Laws , they do n't amount to shucks ` longside of a flea .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 13]: A flea is just a comet b ` iled down small . ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 34]: Jim was a good deal astonished , and so was I. Jim said : `` Is dem figgers jist edjackly true , en no jokin ' en no lies , Mars Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 12]: `` Yes , they are ; they 're perfectly true . ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 17]: `` Well , den , honey , a body 's got to respec ' a flea .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 37]: I ai n't had no respec ' for um befo ' , sca ` sely , but dey ai n't no gittin ' roun ' it , dey do deserve it , dat 's certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 8]: `` Well , I bet they do .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 29]: They 've got ever so much more sense , and brains , and brightness , in proportion to their size , than any other cretur in the world .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 21]: A person can learn them ` most anything ; and they learn it quicker than any other cretur , too .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 52]: They 've been learnt to haul little carriages in harness , and go this way and that way and t ` other way according to their orders ; yes , and to march and drill like soldiers , doing it as exact , according to orders , as soldiers does it .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 14]: They 've been learnt to do all sorts of hard and troublesome things .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 51]: S'pose you could cultivate a flea up to the size of a man , and keep his natural smartness a-growing and a-growing right along up , bigger and bigger , and keener and keener , in the same proportion -- where 'd the human race be , do you reckon ?
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 25]: That flea would be President of the United States , and you could n't any more prevent it than you can prevent lightning . ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 20]: `` My lan ' , Mars Tom , I never knowed dey was so much TO de beas ' .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 20]: No , sir , I never had no idea of it , and dat 's de fac ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 29]: `` There 's more to him , by a long sight , than there is to any other cretur , man or beast , in proportion to size .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 8]: He 's the interestingest of them all .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 22]: People have so much to say about an ant 's strength , and an elephant 's , and a locomotive 's .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 10]: Shucks , they do n't begin with a flea .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 12]: He can lift two or three hundred times his own weight .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 10]: And none of them can come anywhere near it .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 50]: And , moreover , he has got notions of his own , and is very particular , and you ca n't fool him ; his instinct , or his judgment , or whatever it is , is perfectly sound and clear , and do n't ever make a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 10]: People think all humans are alike to a flea .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 5]: It ai n't so .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 22]: There 's folks that he wo n't go near , hungry or not hungry , and I 'm one of them .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 14]: I 've never had one of them on me in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 5]: `` Mars Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 11]: `` It 's so ; I ai n't joking . ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 19]: `` Well , sah , I hai n't ever heard de likes o ' dat befo ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 27]: Jim could n't believe it , and I could n't ; so we had to drop down to the sand and git a supply and see .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 4]: Tom was right .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 20]: They went for me and Jim by the thousand , but not a one of them lit on Tom .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 20]: There war n't no explaining it , but there it was and there war n't no getting around it .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 35]: He said it had always been just so , and he 'd just as soon be where there was a million of them as not ; they 'd never touch him nor bother him .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 49]: We went up to the cold weather to freeze 'em out , and stayed a little spell , and then come back to the comfortable weather and went lazying along twenty or twenty-five miles an hour , the way we 'd been doing for the last few hours .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 58]: The reason was , that the longer we was in that solemn , peaceful desert , the more the hurry and fuss got kind of soothed down in us , and the more happier and contented and satisfied we got to feeling , and the more we got to liking the desert , and then loving it .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 42]: So we had cramped the speed down , as I was saying , and was having a most noble good lazy time , sometimes watching through the glasses , sometimes stretched out on the lockers reading , sometimes taking a nap .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 27]: It did n't seem like we was the same lot that was in such a state to find land and git ashore , but it was .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 11]: But we had got over that -- clean over it .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 22]: We was used to the balloon now and not afraid any more , and did n't want to be anywheres else .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 31]: Why , it seemed just like home ; it ` most seemed as if I had been born and raised in it , and Jim and Tom said the same .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 147]: And always I had had hateful people around me , a-nagging at me , and pestering of me , and scolding , and finding fault , and fussing and bothering , and sticking to me , and keeping after me , and making me do this , and making me do that and t ` other , and always selecting out the things I did n't want to do , and then giving me Sam Hill because I shirked and done something else , and just aggravating the life out of a body all the time ; but up here in the sky it was so still and sunshiny and lovely , and plenty to eat , and plenty of sleep , and strange things to see , and no nagging and no pestering , and no good people , and just holiday all the time .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 17]: Land , I war n't in no hurry to git out and buck at civilization again .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 71]: Now , one of the worst things about civilization is , that anybody that gits a letter with trouble in it comes and tells you all about it and makes you feel bad , and the newspapers fetches you the troubles of everybody all over the world , and keeps you downhearted and dismal ` most all the time , and it 's such a heavy load for a person .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 47]: I hate them newspapers ; and I hate letters ; and if I had my way I would n't allow nobody to load his troubles on to other folks he ai n't acquainted with , on t ` other side of the world , that way .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 22]: Well , up in a balloon there ai n't any of that , and it 's the darlingest place there is .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 17]: We had supper , and that night was one of the prettiest nights I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 51]: The moon made it just like daylight , only a heap softer ; and once we see a lion standing all alone by himself , just all alone on the earth , it seemed like , and his shadder laid on the sand by him like a puddle of ink .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 9]: That 's the kind of moonlight to have .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 18]: Mainly we laid on our backs and talked ; we did n't want to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 14]: Tom said we was right in the midst of the Arabian Nights now .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 52]: He said it was right along here that one of the cutest things in that book happened ; so we looked down and watched while he told about it , because there ai n't anything that is so interesting to look at as a place that a book has talked about .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 39]: It was a tale about a camel-driver that had lost his camel , and he come along in the desert and met a man , and says : `` Have you run across a stray camel to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 15]: And the man says : `` Was he blind in his left eye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 10]: `` Had he lost an upper front tooth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 9]: `` Was his off hind leg lame ? ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 16]: `` Was he loaded with millet-seed on one side and honey on the other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 25]: `` Yes , but you need n't go into no more details -- that 's the one , and I 'm in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 7]: Where did you see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 14]: `` I hai n't seen him at all , '' the man says .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 8]: `` Hai n't seen him at all ?
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 11]: How can you describe him so close , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 32]: `` Because when a person knows how to use his eyes , everything has got a meaning to it ; but most people 's eyes ai n't any good to them .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 14]: I knowed a camel had been along , because I seen his track .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 28]: I knowed he was lame in his off hind leg because he had favored that foot and trod light on it , and his track showed it .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 23]: I knowed he was blind on his left side because he only nibbled the grass on the right side of the trail .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 21]: I knowed he had lost an upper front tooth because where he bit into the sod his teeth-print showed it .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 28]: The millet-seed sifted out on one side -- the ants told me that ; the honey leaked out on the other -- the flies told me that .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 15]: I know all about your camel , but I hai n't seen him . ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 23]: Jim says : `` Go on , Mars Tom , hit 's a mighty good tale , and powerful interestin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 9]: `` That 's all , '' Tom says .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 4]: `` ALL ? ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 5]: says Jim , astonished .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 10]: `` What ` come o ' de camel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 11]: `` Mars Tom , do n't de tale say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 12]: Jim puzzled a minute , then he says : `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 12]: Ef dat ai n't de beatenes ' tale ever I struck .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 18]: Jist gits to de place whah de intrust is gittin ' red-hot , en down she breaks .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 18]: Why , Mars Tom , dey ai n't no SENSE in a tale dat acts like dat .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 17]: Hai n't you got no IDEA whether de man got de camel back er not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 8]: `` No , I have n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 84]: I see myself there war n't no sense in the tale , to chop square off that way before it come to anything , but I war n't going to say so , because I could see Tom was souring up pretty fast over the way it flatted out and the way Jim had popped on to the weak place in it , and I do n't think it 's fair for everybody to pile on to a feller when he 's down .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 19]: But Tom he whirls on me and says : `` What do YOU think of the tale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 60]: Of course , then , I had to come out and make a clean breast and say it did seem to me , too , same as it did to Jim , that as long as the tale stopped square in the middle and never got to no place , it really war n't worth the trouble of telling .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 60]: Tom 's chin dropped on his breast , and ` stead of being mad , as I reckoned he 'd be , to hear me scoff at his tale that way , he seemed to be only sad ; and he says : `` Some people can see , and some ca n't -- just as that man said .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 24]: Let alone a camel , if a cyclone had gone by , YOU duffers would n't ` a ' noticed the track . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 57]: I do n't know what he meant by that , and he did n't say ; it was just one of his irrulevances , I reckon -- he was full of them , sometimes , when he was in a close place and could n't see no other way out -- but I did n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 22]: We 'd spotted the soft place in that tale sharp enough , he could n't git away from that little fact .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 21]: It graveled him like the nation , too , I reckon , much as he tried not to let on .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 37]: THE DISAPPEARING LAKE WE had an early breakfast in the morning , and set looking down on the desert , and the weather was ever so bammy and lovely , although we war n't high up .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 45]: You have to come down lower and lower after sundown in the desert , because it cools off so fast ; and so , by the time it is getting toward dawn , you are skimming along only a little ways above the sand .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 66]: We was watching the shadder of the balloon slide along the ground , and now and then gazing off across the desert to see if anything was stirring , and then down on the shadder again , when all of a sudden almost right under us we see a lot of men and camels laying scattered about , perfectly quiet , like they was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 24]: We shut off the power , and backed up and stood over them , and then we see that they was all dead .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 7]: It give us the cold shivers .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 19]: And it made us hush down , too , and talk low , like people at a funeral .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 18]: We dropped down slow and stopped , and me and Tom clumb down and went among them .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 10]: There was men , and women , and children .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 23]: They was dried by the sun and dark and shriveled and leathery , like the pictures of mummies you see in books .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 23]: And yet they looked just as human , you would n't ` a ' believed it ; just like they was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 33]: Some of the people and animals was partly covered with sand , but most of them not , for the sand was thin there , and the bed was gravel and hard .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 26]: Most of the clothes had rotted away ; and when you took hold of a rag , it tore with a touch , like spiderweb .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 10]: Tom reckoned they had been laying there for years .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 27]: Some of the men had rusty guns by them , some had swords on and had shawl belts with long , silver-mounted pistols stuck in them .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 25]: All the camels had their loads on yet , but the packs had busted or rotted and spilt the freight out on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 26]: We did n't reckon the swords was any good to the dead people any more , so we took one apiece , and some pistols .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 61]: We took a small box , too , because it was so handsome and inlaid so fine ; and then we wanted to bury the people ; but there war n't no way to do it that we could think of , and nothing to do it with but sand , and that would blow away again , of course .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 36]: Then we mounted high and sailed away , and pretty soon that black spot on the sand was out of sight , and we would n't ever see them poor people again in this world .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 33]: We wondered , and reasoned , and tried to guess how they come to be there , and how it all happened to them , but we could n't make it out .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 48]: First we thought maybe they got lost , and wandered around and about till their food and water give out and they starved to death ; but Tom said no wild animals nor vultures had n't meddled with them , and so that guess would n't do .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 25]: So at last we give it up , and judged we would n't think about it no more , because it made us low-spirited .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 47]: Then we opened the box , and it had gems and jewels in it , quite a pile , and some little veils of the kind the dead women had on , with fringes made out of curious gold money that we war n't acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 60]: We wondered if we better go and try to find them again and give it back ; but Tom thought it over and said no , it was a country that was full of robbers , and they would come and steal it ; and then the sin would be on us for putting the temptation in their way .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 29]: So we went on ; but I wished we had took all they had , so there would n't ` a ' been no temptation at all left .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 22]: We had had two hours of that blazing weather down there , and was dreadful thirsty when we got aboard again .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 25]: We went straight for the water , but it was spoiled and bitter , besides being pretty near hot enough to scald your mouth .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 6]: We could n't drink it .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 40]: It was Mississippi river water , the best in the world , and we stirred up the mud in it to see if that would help , but no , the mud was n't any better than the water .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 58]: Well , we had n't been so very , very thirsty before , while we was interested in the lost people , but we was now , and as soon as we found we could n't have a drink , we was more than thirty-five times as thirsty as we was a quarter of a minute before .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 19]: Why , in a little while we wanted to hold our mouths open and pant like a dog .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 31]: Tom said to keep a sharp lookout , all around , everywheres , because we 'd got to find an oasis or there war n't no telling what would happen .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 5]: So we done it .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 24]: We kept the glasses gliding around all the time , till our arms got so tired we could n't hold them any more .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 31]: Two hours -- three hours -- just gazing and gazing , and nothing but sand , sand , SAND , and you could see the quivering heat-shimmer playing over it .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 37]: Dear , dear , a body do n't know what real misery is till he is thirsty all the way through and is certain he ai n't ever going to come to any water any more .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 27]: At last I could n't stand it to look around on them baking plains ; I laid down on the locker , and give it up .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 14]: But by and by Tom raised a whoop , and there she was !
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 33]: A lake , wide and shiny , with pa 'm - trees leaning over it asleep , and their shadders in the water just as soft and delicate as ever you see .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 8]: I never see anything look so good .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 91]: It was a long ways off , but that war n't anything to us ; we just slapped on a hundred-mile gait , and calculated to be there in seven minutes ; but she stayed the same old distance away , all the time ; we could n't seem to gain on her ; yes , sir , just as far , and shiny , and like a dream ; but we could n't get no nearer ; and at last , all of a sudden , she was gone !
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 20]: Tom 's eyes took a spread , and he says : `` Boys , it was a MYridge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 7]: Said it like he was glad .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 10]: I did n't see nothing to be glad about .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 6]: I says : `` Maybe .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 24]: I do n't care nothing about its name , the thing I want to know is , what 's become of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 31]: Jim was trembling all over , and so scared he could n't speak , but he wanted to ask that question himself if he could ` a ' done it .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 10]: Tom says : `` What 's BECOME of it ?
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 10]: Why , you see yourself it 's gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 14]: `` Yes , I know ; but where 's it gone TO ? ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 21]: He looked me over and says : `` Well , now , Huck Finn , where WOULD it go to !
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 10]: Do n't you know what a myridge is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 7]: `` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 8]: `` It ai n't anything but imagination .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 8]: There ai n't anything TO it . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 32]: It warmed me up a little to hear him talk like that , and I says : `` What 's the use you talking that kind of stuff , Tom Sawyer ?
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 8]: Did n't I see the lake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 9]: `` Yes -- you think you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 15]: `` I do n't think nothing about it , I DID see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 20]: `` I tell you you DID N'T see it either -- because it war n't there to see . ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 40]: It astonished Jim to hear him talk so , and he broke in and says , kind of pleading and distressed : `` Mars Tom , PLEASE do n't say sich things in sich an awful time as dis .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 26]: You ai n't only reskin ' yo ' own self , but you 's reskin ' us -- same way like Anna Nias en Siffra .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 22]: De lake WUZ dah -- I seen it jis ' as plain as I sees you en Huck dis minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 11]: I says : `` Why , he seen it himself !
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 10]: He was the very one that seen it first .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 5]: NOW , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 16]: `` Yes , Mars Tom , hit 's so -- you ca n't deny it .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 13]: We all seen it , en dat PROVE it was dah . ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 4]: `` Proves it !
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 7]: How does it prove it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 14]: `` Same way it does in de courts en everywheres , Mars Tom .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 45]: One pusson might be drunk , or dreamy or suthin ' , en he could be mistaken ; en two might , maybe ; but I tell you , sah , when three sees a thing , drunk er sober , it 's SO .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 19]: Dey ai n't no gittin ' aroun ' dat , en you knows it , Mars Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 10]: `` I do n't know nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 25]: There used to be forty thousand million people that seen the sun move from one side of the sky to the other every day .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 10]: Did that prove that the sun DONE it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 5]: `` Course it did .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 13]: En besides , dey war n't no ` casion to prove it .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 15]: A body ` at 's got any sense ai n't gwine to doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 18]: Dah she is now -- a sailin ' thoo de sky , like she allays done . ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 23]: Tom turned on me , then , and says : `` What do YOU say -- is the sun standing still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 15]: `` Tom Sawyer , what 's the use to ask such a jackass question ?
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 14]: Anybody that ai n't blind can see it do n't stand still . ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 45]: `` Well , '' he says , `` I 'm lost in the sky with no company but a passel of low-down animals that do n't know no more than the head boss of a university did three or four hundred years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 13]: It war n't fair play , and I let him know it .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 16]: I says : `` Throwin ' mud ai n't arguin ' , Tom Sawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 21]: `` Oh , my goodness , oh , my goodness gracious , dah 's de lake agi ` n ! ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 6]: yelled Jim , just then .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 13]: `` NOW , Mars Tom , what you gwine to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 31]: Yes , sir , there was the lake again , away yonder across the desert , perfectly plain , trees and all , just the same as it was before .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 15]: I says : `` I reckon you 're satisfied now , Tom Sawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 20]: But he says , perfectly ca 'm : `` Yes , satisfied there ai n't no lake there . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 21]: Jim says : `` DO N'T talk so , Mars Tom -- it sk ` yers me to hear you .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 24]: It 's so hot , en you 's so thirsty , dat you ai n't in yo ' right mine , Mars Tom .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 9]: Oh , but do n't she look good !
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 23]: ` clah I doan ' know how I 's gwine to wait tell we gits dah , I 's SO thirsty . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 33]: `` Well , you 'll have to wait ; and it wo n't do you no good , either , because there ai n't no lake there , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 25]: I says : `` Jim , do n't you take your eye off of it , and I wo n't , either . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 21]: ` Deed I wo n't ; en bless you , honey , I could n't ef I wanted to . ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 33]: We went a-tearing along toward it , piling the miles behind us like nothing , but never gaining an inch on it -- and all of a sudden it was gone again !
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 9]: Jim staggered , and ` most fell down .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 45]: When he got his breath he says , gasping like a fish : `` Mars Tom , hit 's a GHOS ' , dat 's what it is , en I hopes to goodness we ai n't gwine to see it no mo ' .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 36]: Dey 's BEEN a lake , en suthin 's happened , en de lake 's dead , en we 's seen its ghos ' ; we 's seen it twiste , en dat 's proof .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 69]: De desert 's ha ` nted , it 's ha ` nted , sho ; oh , Mars Tom , le '' s git outen it ; I 'd ruther die den have de night ketch us in it ag ` in en de ghos ' er dat lake come a-mournin ' aroun ' us en we asleep en doan ' know de danger we 's in . ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 6]: `` Ghost , you gander !
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 18]: It ai n't anything but air and heat and thirstiness pasted together by a person 's imagination .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 9]: If I -- gim me the glass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 12]: He grabbed it and begun to gaze off to the right .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 12]: `` It 's a flock of birds , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 19]: `` It 's getting toward sundown , and they 're making a bee-line across our track for somewheres .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 16]: They mean business -- maybe they 're going for food or water , or both .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 6]: Let her go to starboard !
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 5]: -- Port your hellum !
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 3]: Hard down !
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 12]: There -- ease up -- steady , as you go . ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 21]: We shut down some of the power , so as not to outspeed them , and took out after them .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 61]: We went skimming along a quarter of a mile behind them , and when we had followed them an hour and a half and was getting pretty discouraged , and was thirsty clean to unendurableness , Tom says : `` Take the glass , one of you , and see what that is , away ahead of the birds . ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 14]: Jim got the first glimpse , and slumped down on the locker sick .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 54]: He was most crying , and says : `` She 's dah ag ` in , Mars Tom , she 's dah ag ` in , en I knows I 's gwine to die , ` case when a body sees a ghos ' de third time , dat 's what it means .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 15]: I wisht I 'd never come in dis balloon , dat I does . ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 45]: He would n't look no more , and what he said made me afraid , too , because I knowed it was true , for that has always been the way with ghosts ; so then I would n't look any more , either .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 27]: Both of us begged Tom to turn off and go some other way , but he would n't , and said we was ignorant superstitious blatherskites .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 25]: Yes , and he 'll git come up with , one of these days , I says to myself , insulting ghosts that way .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 37]: They 'll stand it for a while , maybe , but they wo n't stand it always , for anybody that knows about ghosts knows how easy they are hurt , and how revengeful they are .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 18]: So we was all quiet and still , Jim and me being scared , and Tom busy .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 25]: By and by Tom fetched the balloon to a standstill , and says : `` NOW get up and look , you sapheads . ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 14]: We done it , and there was the sure-enough water right under us !
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 25]: -- clear , and blue , and cool , and deep , and wavy with the breeze , the loveliest sight that ever was .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 43]: And all about it was grassy banks , and flowers , and shady groves of big trees , looped together with vines , and all looking so peaceful and comfortable -- enough to make a body cry , it was so beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 24]: Jim DID cry , and rip and dance and carry on , he was so thankful and out of his mind for joy .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 55]: It was my watch , so I had to stay by the works , but Tom and Jim clumb down and drunk a barrel apiece , and fetched me up a lot , and I 've tasted a many a good thing in my life , but nothing that ever begun with that water .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 59]: Then we went down and had a swim , and then Tom came up and spelled me , and me and Jim had a swim , and then Jim spelled Tom , and me and Tom had a foot-race and a boxing-mill , and I do n't reckon I ever had such a good time in my life .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 25]: It war n't so very hot , because it was close on to evening , and we had n't any clothes on , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 40]: Clothes is well enough in school , and in towns , and at balls , too , but there ai n't no sense in them when there ai n't no civilization nor other kinds of bothers and fussiness around .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 5]: `` Lions a-comin ' !
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 3]: -- lions !
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 5]: Quick , Mars Tom !
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 9]: Jump for yo ' life , Huck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 7]: Oh , and did n't we !
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 14]: We never stopped for clothes , but waltzed up the ladder just so .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 79]: Jim lost his head straight off -- he always done it whenever he got excited and scared ; and so now , ` stead of just easing the ladder up from the ground a little , so the animals could n't reach it , he turned on a raft of power , and we went whizzing up and was dangling in the sky before he got his wits together and seen what a foolish thing he was doing .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 38]: Then he stopped her , but he had clean forgot what to do next ; so there we was , so high that the lions looked like pups , and we was drifting off on the wind .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 66]: But Tom he shinned up and went for the works and begun to slant her down , and back toward the lake , where the animals was gathering like a camp-meeting , and I judged he had lost HIS head , too ; for he knowed I was too scared to climb , and did he want to dump me among the tigers and things ?
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 15]: But no , his head was level , he knowed what he was about .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 31]: He swooped down to within thirty or forty feet of the lake , and stopped right over the center , and sung out : `` Leggo , and drop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 65]: I done it , and shot down , feet first , and seemed to go about a mile toward the bottom ; and when I come up , he says : `` Now lay on your back and float till you 're rested and got your pluck back , then I 'll dip the ladder in the water and you can climb aboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 4]: I done it .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 54]: Now that was ever so smart in Tom , because if he had started off somewheres else to drop down on the sand , the menagerie would ` a ' come along , too , and might ` a ' kept us hunting a safe place till I got tuckered out and fell .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 68]: And all this time the lions and tigers was sorting out the clothes , and trying to divide them up so there would be some for all , but there was a misunderstanding about it somewheres , on account of some of them trying to hog more than their share ; so there was another insurrection , and you never see anything like it in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 48]: There must ` a ' been fifty of them , all mixed up together , snorting and roaring and snapping and biting and tearing , legs and tails in the air , and you could n't tell which was which , and the sand and fur a-flying .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 64]: And when they got done , some was dead and some was limping off crippled , and the rest was setting around on the battlefield , some of them licking their sore places and the others looking up at us and seemed to be kind of inviting us to come down and have some fun , but which we did n't want any .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 13]: As for the clothes , they war n't any , any more .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 59]: Every last rag of them was inside of the animals ; and not agreeing with them very well , I do n't reckon , for there was considerable many brass buttons on them , and there was knives in the pockets , too , and smoking tobacco , and nails and chalk and marbles and fishhooks and things .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 6]: But I was n't caring .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 54]: All that was bothering me was , that all we had now was the professor 's clothes , a big enough assortment , but not suitable to go into company with , if we came across any , because the britches was as long as tunnels , and the coats and things according .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 37]: Still , there was everything a tailor needed , and Jim was a kind of jack legged tailor , and he allowed he could soon trim a suit or two down for us that would answer .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 22]: TOM DISCOURSES ON THE DESERT STILL , we thought we would drop down there a minute , but on another errand .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 29]: Most of the professor 's cargo of food was put up in cans , in the new way that somebody had just invented ; the rest was fresh .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 23]: When you fetch Missouri beefsteak to the Great Sahara , you want to be particular and stay up in the coolish weather .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 20]: So we reckoned we would drop down into the lion market and see how we could make out there .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 49]: We hauled in the ladder and dropped down till we was just above the reach of the animals , then we let down a rope with a slip-knot in it and hauled up a dead lion , a small tender one , then yanked up a cub tiger .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 26]: We had to keep the congregation off with the revolver , or they would ` a ' took a hand in the proceedings and helped .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 19]: We carved off a supply from both , and saved the skins , and hove the rest overboard .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 17]: Then we baited some of the professor 's hooks with the fresh meat and went a-fishing .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 25]: We stood over the lake just a convenient distance above the water , and catched a lot of the nicest fish you ever see .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 23]: It was a most amazing good supper we had ; lion steak , tiger steak , fried fish , and hot corn-pone .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 9]: I do n't want nothing better than that .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 9]: We had some fruit to finish off with .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 13]: We got it out of the top of a monstrous tall tree .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 30]: It was a very slim tree that had n't a branch on it from the bottom plumb to the top , and there it bursted out like a feather-duster .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 28]: It was a pa 'm - tree , of course ; anybody knows a pa 'm - tree the minute he see it , by the pictures .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 14]: We went for cocoanuts in this one , but there war n't none .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 35]: There was only big loose bunches of things like oversized grapes , and Tom allowed they was dates , because he said they answered the description in the Arabian Nights and the other books .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 31]: Of course they might n't be , and they might be poison ; so we had to wait a spell , and watch and see if the birds et them .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 18]: They done it ; so we done it , too , and they was most amazing good .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 16]: By this time monstrous big birds begun to come and settle on the dead animals .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 25]: They was plucky creturs ; they would tackle one end of a lion that was being gnawed at the other end by another lion .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 26]: If the lion drove the bird away , it did n't do no good ; he was back again the minute the lion was busy .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 37]: The big birds come out of every part of the sky -- you could make them out with the glass while they was still so far away you could n't see them with your naked eye .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 26]: Tom said the birds did n't find out the meat was there by the smell ; they had to find it out by seeing it .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 11]: Oh , but ai n't that an eye for you !
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 42]: Tom said at the distance of five mile a patch of dead lions could n't look any bigger than a person 's finger-nail , and he could n't imagine how the birds could notice such a little thing so far off .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 20]: It was strange and unnatural to see lion eat lion , and we thought maybe they war n't kin .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 10]: But Jim said that did n't make no difference .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 33]: He said a hog was fond of her own children , and so was a spider , and he reckoned maybe a lion was pretty near as unprincipled though maybe not quite .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 39]: He thought likely a lion would n't eat his own father , if he knowed which was him , but reckoned he would eat his brother-in-law if he was uncommon hungry , and eat his mother-in-law any time .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 7]: But RECKONING do n't settle nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 19]: You can reckon till the cows come home , but that do n't fetch you to no decision .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 10]: So we give it up and let it drop .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 17]: Generly it was very still in the Desert nights , but this time there was music .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 41]: A lot of other animals come to dinner ; sneaking yelpers that Tom allowed was jackals , and roached-backed ones that he said was hyenas ; and all the whole biling of them kept up a racket all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 18]: They made a picture in the moonlight that was more different than any picture I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 48]: We had a line out and made fast to the top of a tree , and did n't stand no watch , but all turned in and slept ; but I was up two or three times to look down at the animals and hear the music .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 46]: It was like having a front seat at a menagerie for nothing , which I had n't ever had before , and so it seemed foolish to sleep and not make the most of it ; I might n't ever have such a chance again .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 44]: We went a-fishing again in the early dawn , and then lazied around all day in the deep shade on an island , taking turn about to watch and see that none of the animals come a-snooping around there after erronorts for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 18]: We was going to leave the next day , but could n't , it was too lovely .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 59]: The day after , when we rose up toward the sky and sailed off eastward , we looked back and watched that place till it war n't nothing but just a speck in the Desert , and I tell you it was like saying good-bye to a friend that you ai n't ever going to see any more .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 32]: Jim was thinking to himself , and at last he says : `` Mars Tom , we 's mos ' to de end er de Desert now , I speck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 11]: `` Well , hit stan ' to reason we is .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 12]: You knows how long we 's been a-skimmin ' over it .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 11]: Mus ' be mos ' out o ' san ' .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 18]: Hit 's a wonder to me dat it 's hilt out as long as it has . ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 14]: `` Shucks , there 's plenty sand , you need n't worry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 20]: `` Oh , I ai n't a-worryin ' , Mars Tom , only wonderin ' , dat 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 70]: De Lord 's got plenty san ' , I ai n't doubtin ' dat ; but nemmine , He ai n't gwyne to WAS ' E it jist on dat account ; en I allows dat dis Desert 's plenty big enough now , jist de way she is , en you ca n't spread her out no mo ' ` dout was ` in ' san ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 7]: `` Oh , go ` long !
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 13]: we ai n't much more than fairly STARTED across this Desert yet .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 13]: The United States is a pretty big country , ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 7]: Ai n't it , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' I says , `` there ai n't no bigger one , I do n't reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 49]: `` Well , '' he says , `` this Desert is about the shape of the United States , and if you was to lay it down on top of the United States , it would cover the land of the free out of sight like a blanket .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 32]: There 'd be a little corner sticking out , up at Maine and away up northwest , and Florida sticking out like a turtle 's tail , and that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 61]: We 've took California away from the Mexicans two or three years ago , so that part of the Pacific coast is ours now , and if you laid the Great Sahara down with her edge on the Pacific , she would cover the United States and stick out past New York six hundred miles into the Atlantic ocean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 7]: I say : `` Good land !
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 12]: have you got the documents for that , Tom Sawyer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 16]: `` Yes , and they 're right here , and I 've been studying them .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 6]: You can look for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 10]: From New York to the Pacific is 2,600 miles .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 13]: From one end of the Great Desert to the other is 3,200 .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 13]: The United States contains 3,600,000 square miles , the Desert contains 4,162,000 .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 43]: With the Desert 's bulk you could cover up every last inch of the United States , and in under where the edges projected out , you could tuck England , Scotland , Ireland , France , Denmark , and all Germany .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 39]: Yes , sir , you could hide the home of the brave and all of them countries clean out of sight under the Great Sahara , and you would still have 2,000 square miles of sand left . ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 13]: `` Well , '' I says , `` it clean beats me .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 30]: Why , Tom , it shows that the Lord took as much pains makin ' this Desert as makin ' the United States and all them other countries . ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 14]: Jim says : `` Huck , dat don ' stan ' to reason .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 11]: I reckon dis Desert wa 'n' t made at all .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 22]: Now you take en look at it like dis -- you look at it , and see ef I 's right .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 7]: What 's a desert good for ?
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 7]: ` Taint good for nuthin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 10]: Dey ai n't no way to make it pay .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 8]: Hai n't dat so , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 7]: `` Yes , I reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 10]: `` Hai n't it so , Mars Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 5]: `` I guess so .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 4]: Go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 20]: `` Ef a thing ai n't no good , it 's made in vain , ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 5]: `` NOW , den !
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 8]: Do de Lord make anything in vain ?
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 6]: You answer me dat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 10]: `` Well -- no , He do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 10]: `` Den how come He make a desert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 6]: `` Well , go on .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 9]: How DID He come to make it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 34]: `` Mars Tom , I b ` lieve it uz jes like when you 's buildin ' a house ; dey 's allays a lot o ' truck en rubbish lef ' over .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 7]: What does you do wid it ?
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 20]: Doan ' you take en k ` yart it off en dump it into a ole vacant back lot ?
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 3]: ` Course .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 30]: Now , den , it 's my opinion hit was jes like dat -- dat de Great Sahara war n't made at all , she jes HAPPEN ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 21]: I said it was a real good argument , and I believed it was the best one Jim ever made .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 67]: Tom he said the same , but said the trouble about arguments is , they ai n't nothing but THEORIES , after all , and theories do n't prove nothing , they only give you a place to rest on , a spell , when you are tuckered out butting around and around trying to find out something there ai n't no way TO find out .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 29]: And he says : `` There 's another trouble about theories : there 's always a hole in them somewheres , sure , if you look close enough .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 11]: It 's just so with this one of Jim 's .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 10]: Look what billions and billions of stars there is .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 17]: How does it come that there was just exactly enough star-stuff , and none left over ?
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 13]: How does it come there ai n't no sand-pile up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 16]: But Jim was fixed for him and says : `` What 's de Milky Way ?
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 9]: -- dat 's what I want to know .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 6]: What 's de Milky Way ?
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 5]: Answer me dat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 9]: In my opinion it was just a sockdologer .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 34]: It 's only an opinion , it 's only MY opinion and others may think different ; but I said it then and I stand to it now -- it was a sockdologer .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 10]: And moreover , besides , it landed Tom Sawyer .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 7]: He could n't say a word .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 21]: He had that stunned look of a person that 's been shot in the back with a kag of nails .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 25]: All he said was , as for people like me and Jim , he 'd just as soon have intellectual intercourse with a catfish .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 21]: But anybody can say that -- and I notice they always do , when somebody has fetched them a lifter .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 11]: Tom Sawyer was tired of that end of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 44]: So we got back to talking about the size of the Desert again , and the more we compared it with this and that and t ` other thing , the more nobler and bigger and grander it got to look right along .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 28]: And so , hunting among the figgers , Tom found , by and by , that it was just the same size as the Empire of China .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 25]: Then he showed us the spread the Empire of China made on the map , and the room she took up in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 38]: Well , it was wonderful to think of , and I says : `` Why , I 've heard talk about this Desert plenty of times , but I never knowed before how important she was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 7]: Then Tom says : `` Important !
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 3]: Sahara important !
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 9]: That 's just the way with some people .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 10]: If a thing 's big , it 's important .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 9]: That 's all the sense they 've got .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 7]: All they can see is SIZE .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 6]: Why , look at England .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 46]: It 's the most important country in the world ; and yet you could put it in China 's vest-pocket ; and not only that , but you 'd have the dickens 's own time to find it again the next time you wanted it .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 5]: And look at Russia .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 37]: It spreads all around and everywhere , and yet ai n't no more important in this world than Rhode Island is , and has n't got half as much in it that 's worth saving . ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 19]: Away off now we see a little hill , a-standing up just on the edge of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 40]: Tom broke off his talk , and reached for a glass very much excited , and took a look , and says : `` That 's it -- it 's the one I 've been looking for , sure .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 23]: If I 'm right , it 's the one the dervish took the man into and showed him all the treasures . ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 19]: So we begun to gaze , and he begun to tell about it out of the Arabian Nights .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 3]: CHAPTER X .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 9]: THE TREASURE-HILL TOM said it happened like this .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 72]: A dervish was stumping it along through the Desert , on foot , one blazing hot day , and he had come a thousand miles and was pretty poor , and hungry , and ornery and tired , and along about where we are now he run across a camel-driver with a hundred camels , and asked him for some a ` ms. But the cameldriver he asked to be excused .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 13]: The dervish said : `` Do n't you own these camels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 8]: `` Yes , they 're mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 7]: `` Are you in debt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 5]: `` Who -- me ?
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 3]: No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 27]: `` Well , a man that owns a hundred camels and ai n't in debt is rich -- and not only rich , but very rich .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 6]: Ai n't it so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 9]: The camel-driver owned up that it was so .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 19]: Then the dervish says : `` God has made you rich , and He has made me poor .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 15]: He has His reasons , and they are wise , blessed be His name .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 41]: But He has willed that His rich shall help His poor , and you have turned away from me , your brother , in my need , and He will remember this , and you will lose by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 82]: That made the camel-driver feel shaky , but all the same he was born hoggish after money and did n't like to let go a cent ; so he begun to whine and explain , and said times was hard , and although he had took a full freight down to Balsora and got a fat rate for it , he could n't git no return freight , and so he war n't making no great things out of his trip .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 39]: So the dervish starts along again , and says : `` All right , if you want to take the risk ; but I reckon you 've made a mistake this time , and missed a chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 62]: Of course the camel-driver wanted to know what kind of a chance he had missed , because maybe there was money in it ; so he run after the dervish , and begged him so hard and earnest to take pity on him that at last the dervish gave in , and says : `` Do you see that hill yonder ?
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 69]: Well , in that hill is all the treasures of the earth , and I was looking around for a man with a particular good kind heart and a noble , generous disposition , because if I could find just that man , I 've got a kind of a salve I could put on his eyes and he could see the treasures and get them out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 58]: So then the camel-driver was in a sweat ; and he cried , and begged , and took on , and went down on his knees , and said he was just that kind of a man , and said he could fetch a thousand people that would say he was n't ever described so exact before .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 14]: `` Well , then , '' says the dervish , `` all right .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 15]: If we load the hundred camels , can I have half of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 22]: The driver was so glad he could n't hardly hold in , and says : `` Now you 're shouting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 60]: So they shook hands on the bargain , and the dervish got out his box and rubbed the salve on the driver 's right eye , and the hill opened and he went in , and there , sure enough , was piles and piles of gold and jewels sparkling like all the stars in heaven had fell down .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 37]: So him and the dervish laid into it , and they loaded every camel till he could n't carry no more ; then they said good-bye , and each of them started off with his fifty .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 35]: But pretty soon the camel-driver come a-running and overtook the dervish and says : `` You ai n't in society , you know , and you do n't really need all you 've got .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 16]: Wo n't you be good , and let me have ten of your camels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 22]: `` Well , '' the dervish says , `` I do n't know but what you say is reasonable enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 18]: So he done it , and they separated and the dervish started off again with his forty .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 62]: But pretty soon here comes the camel-driver bawling after him again , and whines and slobbers around and begs another ten off of him , saying thirty camel loads of treasures was enough to see a dervish through , because they live very simple , you know , and do n't keep house , but board around and give their note .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 8]: But that war n't the end yet .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 21]: That ornery hound kept coming and coming till he had begged back all the camels and had the whole hundred .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 39]: Then he was satisfied , and ever so grateful , and said he would n't ever forgit the dervish as long as he lived , and nobody had n't been so good to him before , and liberal .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 13]: So they shook hands good-bye , and separated and started off again .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 32]: But do you know , it war n't ten minutes till the camel-driver was unsatisfied again -- he was the lowdownest reptyle in seven counties -- and he come a-running again .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 23]: And this time the thing he wanted was to get the dervish to rub some of the salve on his other eye .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 4]: said the dervish .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 11]: `` Oh , you know , '' says the driver .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 5]: `` Know what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 14]: `` Well , you ca n't fool me , '' says the driver .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 17]: `` You 're trying to keep back something from me , you know it mighty well .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 27]: You know , I reckon , that if I had the salve on the other eye I could see a lot more things that 's valuable .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 8]: Come -- please put it on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 14]: The dervish says : `` I was n't keeping anything back from you .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 15]: I do n't mind telling you what would happen if I put it on .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 6]: You 'd never see again .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 11]: You 'd be stone-blind the rest of your days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 11]: But do you know that beat would n't believe him .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 33]: No , he begged and begged , and whined and cried , till at last the dervish opened his box and told him to put it on , if he wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 20]: So the man done it , and sure enough he was as blind as a bat in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 36]: Then the dervish laughed at him and mocked at him and made fun of him ; and says : `` Good-bye -- a man that 's blind hai n't got no use for jewelry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 30]: And he cleared out with the hundred camels , and left that man to wander around poor and miserable and friendless the rest of his days in the Desert .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 12]: Jim said he 'd bet it was a lesson to him .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' Tom says , `` and like a considerable many lessons a body gets .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 22]: They ai n't no account , because the thing do n't ever happen the same way again -- and ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 25]: The time Hen Scovil fell down the chimbly and crippled his back for life , everybody said it would be a lesson to him .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 6]: What kind of a lesson ?
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 8]: How was he going to use it ?
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 19]: He could n't climb chimblies no more , and he had n't no more backs to break . ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 19]: `` All de same , Mars Tom , dey IS sich a thing as learnin ' by expe'ence .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 12]: De Good Book say de burnt chile shun de fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 27]: `` Well , I ai n't denying that a thing 's a lesson if it 's a thing that can happen twice just the same way .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 61]: There 's lots of such things , and THEY educate a person , that 's what Uncle Abner always said ; but there 's forty MILLION lots of the other kind -- the kind that do n't happen the same way twice -- and they ai n't no real use , they ai n't no more instructive than the small-pox .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 40]: When you 've got it , it ai n't no good to find out you ought to been vaccinated , and it ai n't no good to git vaccinated afterward , because the small-pox do n't come but once .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 76]: But , on the other hand , Uncle Abner said that the person that had took a bull by the tail once had learnt sixty or seventy times as much as a person that had n't , and said a person that started in to carry a cat home by the tail was gitting knowledge that was always going to be useful to him , and war n't ever going to grow dim or doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 41]: But I can tell you , Jim , Uncle Abner was down on them people that 's all the time trying to dig a lesson out of everything that happens , no matter whether -- '' But Jim was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 38]: Tom looked kind of ashamed , because you know a person always feels bad when he is talking uncommon fine and thinks the other person is admiring , and that other person goes to sleep that way .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 55]: Of course he ought n't to go to sleep , because it 's shabby ; but the finer a person talks the certainer it is to make you sleep , and so when you come to look at it it ai n't nobody 's fault in particular ; both of them 's to blame .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 129]: Jim begun to snore -- soft and blubbery at first , then a long rasp , then a stronger one , then a half a dozen horrible ones like the last water sucking down the plug-hole of a bath-tub , then the same with more power to it , and some big coughs and snorts flung in , the way a cow does that is choking to death ; and when the person has got to that point he is at his level best , and can wake up a man that is in the next block with a dipperful of loddanum in him , but ca n't wake himself up although all that awful noise of his 'n ai n't but three inches from his own ears .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 14]: And that is the curiosest thing in the world , seems to me .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 21]: But you rake a match to light the candle , and that little bit of a noise will fetch him .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 24]: I wish I knowed what was the reason of that , but there do n't seem to be no way to find out .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 64]: Now there was Jim alarming the whole Desert , and yanking the animals out , for miles and miles around , to see what in the nation was going on up there ; there war n't nobody nor nothing that was as close to the noise as HE was , and yet he was the only cretur that was n't disturbed by it .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 37]: We yelled at him and whooped at him , it never done no good ; but the first time there come a little wee noise that was n't of a usual kind it woke him up .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 34]: No , sir , I 've thought it all over , and so has Tom , and there ai n't no way to find out why a snorer ca n't hear himself snore .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 19]: Jim said he had n't been asleep ; he just shut his eyes so he could listen better .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 8]: Tom said nobody war n't accusing him .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 13]: That made him look like he wished he had n't said anything .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 44]: And he wanted to git away from the subject , I reckon , because he begun to abuse the camel-driver , just the way a person does when he has got catched in something and wants to take it out of somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 41]: He let into the camel-driver the hardest he knowed how , and I had to agree with him ; and he praised up the dervish the highest he could , and I had to agree with him there , too .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 11]: But Tom says : `` I ai n't so sure .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 20]: You call that dervish so dreadful liberal and good and unselfish , but I do n't quite see it .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 12]: He did n't hunt up another poor dervish , did he ?
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 6]: No , he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 27]: If he was so unselfish , why did n't he go in there himself and take a pocketful of jewels and go along and be satisfied ?
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 18]: No , sir , the person he was hunting for was a man with a hundred camels .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 13]: He wanted to get away with all the treasure he could . ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 25]: `` Why , Mars Tom , he was willin ' to divide , fair and square ; he only struck for fifty camels . ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 18]: `` Because he knowed how he was going to get all of them by and by . ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 16]: `` Mars Tom , he TOLE de man de truck would make him bline . ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 11]: `` Yes , because he knowed the man 's character .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 37]: It was just the kind of a man he was hunting for -- a man that never believes in anybody 's word or anybody 's honorableness , because he ai n't got none of his own .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 11]: I reckon there 's lots of people like that dervish .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 19]: They swindle , right and left , but they always make the other person SEEM to swindle himself .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 25]: They keep inside of the letter of the law all the time , and there ai n't no way to git hold of them .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 37]: THEY do n't put the salve on -- oh , no , that would be sin ; but they know how to fool YOU into putting it on , then it 's you that blinds yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 40]: I reckon the dervish and the camel-driver was just a pair -- a fine , smart , brainy rascal , and a dull , coarse , ignorant one , but both of them rascals , just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 24]: `` Mars Tom , does you reckon dey 's any o ' dat kind o ' salve in de worl ' now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 9]: `` Yes , Uncle Abner says there is .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 61]: He says they 've got it in New York , and they put it on country people 's eyes and show them all the railroads in the world , and they go in and git them , and then when they rub the salve on the other eye the other man bids them goodbye and goes off with their railroads .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 6]: Here 's the treasure-hill now .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 4]: Lower away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 34]: We landed , but it war n't as interesting as I thought it was going to be , because we could n't find the place where they went in to git the treasure .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 22]: Still , it was plenty interesting enough , just to see the mere hill itself where such a wonderful thing happened .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 23]: Jim said he wou ` d n't ` a ' missed it for three dollars , and I felt the same way .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 69]: And to me and Jim , as wonderful a thing as any was the way Tom could come into a strange big country like this and go straight and find a little hump like that and tell it in a minute from a million other humps that was almost just like it , and nothing to help him but only his own learning and his own natural smartness .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 18]: We talked and talked it over together , but could n't make out how he done it .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 32]: He had the best head on him I ever see ; and all he lacked was age , to make a name for himself equal to Captain Kidd or George Washington .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 56]: I bet you it would ` a ' crowded either of THEM to find that hill , with all their gifts , but it war n't nothing to Tom Sawyer ; he went across Sahara and put his finger on it as easy as you could pick a nigger out of a bunch of angels .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 42]: We found a pond of salt water close by and scraped up a raft of salt around the edges , and loaded up the lion 's skin and the tiger 's so as they would keep till Jim could tan them .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 46]: THE SAND-STORM WE went a-fooling along for a day or two , and then just as the full moon was touching the ground on the other side of the desert , we see a string of little black figgers moving across its big silver face .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 17]: You could see them as plain as if they was painted on the moon with ink .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 5]: It was another caravan .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 24]: We cooled down our speed and tagged along after it , just to have company , though it war n't going our way .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 46]: It was a rattler , that caravan , and a most bully sight to look at next morning when the sun come a-streaming across the desert and flung the long shadders of the camels on the gold sand like a thousand grand-daddy-long-legses marching in procession .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 28]: We never went very near it , because we knowed better now than to act like that and scare people 's camels and break up their caravans .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 16]: It was the gayest outfit you ever see , for rich clothes and nobby style .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 69]: Some of the chiefs rode on dromedaries , the first we ever see , and very tall , and they go plunging along like they was on stilts , and they rock the man that is on them pretty violent and churn up his dinner considerable , I bet you , but they make noble good time , and a camel ai n't nowheres with them for speed .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 23]: The caravan camped , during the middle part of the day , and then started again about the middle of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 10]: Before long the sun begun to look very curious .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 68]: First it kind of turned to brass , and then to copper , and after that it begun to look like a blood-red ball , and the air got hot and close , and pretty soon all the sky in the west darkened up and looked thick and foggy , but fiery and dreadful -- like it looks through a piece of red glass , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 41]: We looked down and see a big confusion going on in the caravan , and a rushing every which way like they was scared ; and then they all flopped down flat in the sand and laid there perfectly still .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 39]: Pretty soon we see something coming that stood up like an amazing wide wall , and reached from the Desert up into the sky and hid the sun , and it was coming like the nation , too .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 47]: Then a little faint breeze struck us , and then it come harder , and grains of sand begun to sift against our faces and sting like fire , and Tom sung out : `` It 's a sand-storm -- turn your backs to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 39]: We done it ; and in another minute it was blowing a gale , and the sand beat against us by the shovelful , and the air was so thick with it we could n't see a thing .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 34]: In five minutes the boat was level full , and we was setting on the lockers buried up to the chin in sand , and only our heads out and could hardly breathe .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 27]: Then the storm thinned , and we see that monstrous wall go a-sailing off across the desert , awful to look at , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 31]: We dug ourselves out and looked down , and where the caravan was before there was n't anything but just the sand ocean now , and all still and quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 51]: All them people and camels was smothered and dead and buried -- buried under ten foot of sand , we reckoned , and Tom allowed it might be years before the wind uncovered them , and all that time their friends would n't ever know what become of that caravan .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 24]: Tom said : `` NOW we know what it was that happened to the people we got the swords and pistols from . ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 9]: Yes , sir , that was just it .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 8]: It was as plain as day now .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 37]: They got buried in a sand-storm , and the wild animals could n't get at them , and the wind never uncovered them again until they was dried to leather and war n't fit to eat .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 46]: It seemed to me we had felt as sorry for them poor people as a person could for anybody , and as mournful , too , but we was mistaken ; this last caravan 's death went harder with us , a good deal harder .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 45]: You see , the others was total strangers , and we never got to feeling acquainted with them at all , except , maybe , a little with the man that was watching the girl , but it was different with this last caravan .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 28]: We was huvvering around them a whole night and ` most a whole day , and had got to feeling real friendly with them , and acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 27]: I have found out that there ai n't no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 5]: Just so with these .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 18]: We kind of liked them from the start , and traveling with them put on the finisher .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 38]: The longer we traveled with them , and the more we got used to their ways , the better and better we liked them , and the gladder and gladder we was that we run across them .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 61]: We had come to know some of them so well that we called them by name when we was talking about them , and soon got so familiar and sociable that we even dropped the Miss and Mister and just used their plain names without any handle , and it did not seem unpolite , but just the right thing .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 16]: Of course , it was n't their own names , but names we give them .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 53]: There was Mr. Elexander Robinson and Miss Adaline Robinson , and Colonel Jacob McDougal and Miss Harryet McDougal , and Judge Jeremiah Butler and young Bushrod Butler , and these was big chiefs mostly that wore splendid great turbans and simmeters , and dressed like the Grand Mogul , and their families .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 54]: But as soon as we come to know them good , and like them very much , it war n't Mister , nor Judge , nor nothing , any more , but only Elleck , and Addy , and Jake , and Hattie , and Jerry , and Buck , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 29]: And you know the more you join in with people in their joys and their sorrows , the more nearer and dearer they come to be to you .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 56]: Now we war n't cold and indifferent , the way most travelers is , we was right down friendly and sociable , and took a chance in everything that was going , and the caravan could depend on us to be on hand every time , it did n't make no difference what it was .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 20]: When they camped , we camped right over them , ten or twelve hundred feet up in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 23]: When they et a meal , we et ourn , and it made it ever so much home-liker to have their company .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 46]: When they had a wedding that night , and Buck and Addy got married , we got ourselves up in the very starchiest of the professor 's duds for the blow-out , and when they danced we jined in and shook a foot up there .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 23]: But it is sorrow and trouble that brings you the nearest , and it was a funeral that done it with us .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 11]: It was next morning , just in the still dawn .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 60]: We did n't know the diseased , and he war n't in our set , but that never made no difference ; he belonged to the caravan , and that was enough , and there war n't no more sincerer tears shed over him than the ones we dripped on him from up there eleven hundred foot on high .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 32]: Yes , parting with this caravan was much more bitterer than it was to part with them others , which was comparative strangers , and been dead so long , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 78]: We had knowed these in their lives , and was fond of them , too , and now to have death snatch them from right before our faces while we was looking , and leave us so lonesome and friendless in the middle of that big desert , it did hurt so , and we wished we might n't ever make any more friends on that voyage if we was going to lose them again like that .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 37]: We could n't keep from talking about them , and they was all the time coming up in our memory , and looking just the way they looked when we was all alive and happy together .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 119]: We could see the line marching , and the shiny spearheads a-winking in the sun ; we could see the dromedaries lumbering along ; we could see the wedding and the funeral ; and more oftener than anything else we could see them praying , because they do n't allow nothing to prevent that ; whenever the call come , several times a day , they would stop right there , and stand up and face to the east , and lift back their heads , and spread out their arms and begin , and four or five times they would go down on their knees , and then fall forward and touch their forehead to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 46]: Well , it war n't good to go on talking about them , lovely as they was in their life , and dear to us in their life and death both , because it did n't do no good , and made us too down-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 59]: Jim allowed he was going to live as good a life as he could , so he could see them again in a better world ; and Tom kept still and did n't tell him they was only Mohammedans ; it war n't no use to disappoint him , he was feeling bad enough just as it was .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 48]: When we woke up next morning we was feeling a little cheerfuller , and had had a most powerful good sleep , because sand is the comfortablest bed there is , and I do n't see why people that can afford it do n't have it more .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 18]: And it 's terrible good ballast , too ; I never see the balloon so steady before .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 35]: Tom allowed we had twenty tons of it , and wondered what we better do with it ; it was good sand , and it did n't seem good sense to throw it away .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 18]: Jim says : `` Mars Tom , ca n't we tote it back home en sell it ?
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 7]: How long 'll it take ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: `` Depends on the way we go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 34]: `` Well , sah , she 's wuth a quarter of a dollar a load at home , en I reckon we 's got as much as twenty loads , hai n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 7]: How much would dat be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 5]: `` Five dollars . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 17]: `` By jings , Mars Tom , le 's shove for home right on de spot !
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 16]: Hit 's more 'n a dollar en a half apiece , hai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 16]: `` Well , ef dat ai n't makin ' money de easiest ever I struck !
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 16]: She jes ' rained in -- never cos ' us a lick o ' work .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 10]: Le 's mosey right along , Mars Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 16]: But Tom was thinking and ciphering away so busy and excited he never heard him .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 11]: Pretty soon he says : `` Five dollars -- sho !
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 21]: Look here , this sand 's worth -- worth -- why , it 's worth no end of money . ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 8]: `` How is dat , Mars Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 9]: Go on , honey , go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 52]: `` Well , the minute people knows it 's genuwyne sand from the genuwyne Desert of Sahara , they 'll just be in a perfect state of mind to git hold of some of it to keep on the what-not in a vial with a label on it for a curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 29]: All we got to do is to put it up in vials and float around all over the United States and peddle them out at ten cents apiece .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 17]: We 've got all of ten thousand dollars ' worth of sand in this boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 81]: Me and Jim went all to pieces with joy , and begun to shout whoopjamboreehoo , and Tom says : `` And we can keep on coming back and fetching sand , and coming back and fetching more sand , and just keep it a-going till we 've carted this whole Desert over there and sold it out ; and there ai n't ever going to be any opposition , either , because we 'll take out a patent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 24]: `` My goodness , '' I says , `` we 'll be as rich as Creosote , wo n't we , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 8]: `` Yes -- Creesus , you mean .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 33]: Why , that dervish was hunting in that little hill for the treasures of the earth , and did n't know he was walking over the real ones for a thousand miles .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 10]: He was blinder than he made the driver . ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 14]: `` Mars Tom , how much is we gwyne to be worth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 9]: `` Well , I do n't know yet .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 36]: It 's got to be ciphered , and it ai n't the easiest job to do , either , because it 's over four million square miles of sand at ten cents a vial . ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 38]: Jim was awful excited , but this faded it out considerable , and he shook his head and says : `` Mars Tom , we ca n't ` ford all dem vials -- a king could n't .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 24]: We better not try to take de whole Desert , Mars Tom , de vials gwyne to bust us , sho ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 26]: Tom 's excitement died out , too , now , and I reckoned it was on account of the vials , but it was n't .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 33]: He set there thinking , and got bluer and bluer , and at last he says : `` Boys , it wo n't work ; we got to give it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 6]: `` Why , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 8]: `` On account of the duties . ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 13]: I could n't make nothing out of that , neither could Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 11]: I says : `` What IS our duty , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 17]: Because if we ca n't git around it , why ca n't we just DO it ?
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 6]: People often has to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 15]: But he says : `` Oh , it ai n't that kind of duty .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 8]: The kind I mean is a tax .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 72]: Whenever you strike a frontier -- that 's the border of a country , you know -- you find a custom-house there , and the gov ` ment officers comes and rummages among your things and charges a big tax , which they call a duty because it 's their duty to bust you if they can , and if you do n't pay the duty they 'll hog your sand .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 24]: They call it confiscating , but that do n't deceive nobody , it 's just hogging , and that 's all it is .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 66]: Now if we try to carry this sand home the way we 're pointed now , we got to climb fences till we git tired -- just frontier after frontier -- Egypt , Arabia , Hindostan , and so on , and they 'll all whack on a duty , and so you see , easy enough , we CA N'T go THAT road . ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 28]: `` Why , Tom , '' I says , `` we can sail right over their old frontiers ; how are THEY going to stop us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 25]: He looked sorrowful at me , and says , very grave : `` Huck Finn , do you think that would be honest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 7]: I hate them kind of interruptions .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 23]: I never said nothing , and he went on : `` Well , we 're shut off the other way , too .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 41]: If we go back the way we 've come , there 's the New York custom-house , and that is worse than all of them others put together , on account of the kind of cargo we 've got . ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 34]: `` Well , they ca n't raise Sahara sand in America , of course , and when they ca n't raise a thing there , the duty is fourteen hundred thousand per cent .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 17]: on it if you try to fetch it in from where they do raise it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 13]: `` There ai n't no sense in that , Tom Sawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 6]: `` Who said there WAS ?
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 13]: What do you talk to me like that for , Huck Finn ?
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 23]: You wait till I say a thing 's got sense in it before you go to accusing me of saying it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 13]: `` All right , consider me crying about it , and sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 4]: Go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 34]: Jim says : `` Mars Tom , do dey jam dat duty onto everything we ca n't raise in America , en do n't make no ` stinction ` twix ' anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 10]: `` Yes , that 's what they do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 22]: `` Mars Tom , ai n't de blessin ' o ' de Lord de mos ' valuable thing dey is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 7]: `` Yes , it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 20]: `` Do n't de preacher stan ' up in de pulpit en call it down on de people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 8]: `` Whah do it come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 5]: `` From heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 3]: `` Yassir !
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 25]: you 's jes ' right , ` deed you is , honey -- it come from heaven , en dat 's a foreign country .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 4]: NOW , den !
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 11]: do dey put a tax on dat blessin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 8]: `` No , they do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 21]: `` Course dey do n't ; en so it stan ' to reason dat you 's mistaken , Mars Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 44]: Dey would n't put de tax on po ' truck like san ' , dat everybody ai n't ` bleeged to have , en leave it off 'n de bes ' thing dey is , which nobody ca n't git along widout . ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 17]: Tom Sawyer was stumped ; he see Jim had got him where he could n't budge .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 52]: He tried to wiggle out by saying they had FORGOT to put on that tax , but they 'd be sure to remember about it , next session of Congress , and then they 'd put it on , but that was a poor lame come-off , and he knowed it .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 38]: He said there war n't nothing foreign that war n't taxed but just that one , and so they could n't be consistent without taxing it , and to be consistent was the first law of politics .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 31]: So he stuck to it that they 'd left it out unintentional and would be certain to do their best to fix it before they got caught and laughed at .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 34]: But I did n't feel no more interest in such things , as long as we could n't git our sand through , and it made me low-spirited , and Jim the same .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 49]: Tom he tried to cheer us up by saying he would think up another speculation for us that would be just as good as this one and better , but it did n't do no good , we did n't believe there was any as big as this .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 52]: It was mighty hard ; such a little while ago we was so rich , and could ` a ' bought a country and started a kingdom and been celebrated and happy , and now we was so poor and ornery again , and had our sand left on our hands .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 93]: The sand was looking so lovely before , just like gold and di ` monds , and the feel of it was so soft and so silky and nice , but now I could n't bear the sight of it , it made me sick to look at it , and I knowed I would n't ever feel comfortable again till we got shut of it , and I did n't have it there no more to remind us of what we had been and what we had got degraded down to .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 13]: The others was feeling the same way about it that I was .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 21]: I knowed it , because they cheered up so , the minute I says le 's throw this truck overboard .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 31]: Well , it was going to be work , you know , and pretty solid work , too ; so Tom he divided it up according to fairness and strength .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 19]: He said me and him would clear out a fifth apiece of the sand , and Jim three-fifths .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 9]: Jim he did n't quite like that arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 44]: He says : `` Course I 's de stronges ' , en I 's willin ' to do a share accordin ' , but by jings you 's kinder pilin ' it onto ole Jim , Mars Tom , hai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 26]: `` Well , I did n't think so , Jim , but you try your hand at fixing it , and let 's see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 20]: So Jim reckoned it would n't be no more than fair if me and Tom done a TENTH apiece .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 42]: Tom he turned his back to git room and be private , and then he smole a smile that spread around and covered the whole Sahara to the westward , back to the Atlantic edge of it where we come from .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 22]: Then he turned around again and said it was a good enough arrangement , and we was satisfied if Jim was .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 5]: Jim said he was .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 91]: So then Tom measured off our two-tenths in the bow and left the rest for Jim , and it surprised Jim a good deal to see how much difference there was and what a raging lot of sand his share come to , and said he was powerful glad now that he had spoke up in time and got the first arrangement altered , for he said that even the way it was now , there was more sand than enjoyment in his end of the contract , he believed .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 6]: Then we laid into it .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 29]: It was mighty hot work , and tough ; so hot we had to move up into cooler weather or we could n't ` a ' stood it .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 41]: Me and Tom took turn about , and one worked while t ` other rested , but there war n't nobody to spell poor old Jim , and he made all that part of Africa damp , he sweated so .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 60]: We could n't work good , we was so full of laugh , and Jim he kept fretting and wanting to know what tickled us so , and we had to keep making up things to account for it , and they was pretty poor inventions , but they done well enough , Jim did n't see through them .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 20]: At last when we got done we was ` most dead , but not with work but with laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 72]: By and by Jim was ` most dead , too , but : it was with work ; then we took turns and spelled him , and he was as thankfull as he could be , and would set on the gunnel and swab the sweat , and heave and pant , and say how good we was to a poor old nigger , and he would n't ever forgit us .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 19]: He was always the gratefulest nigger I ever see , for any little thing you done for him .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 15]: He was only nigger outside ; inside he was as white as you be .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 59]: JIM STANDING SIEGE THE next few meals was pretty sandy , but that do n't make no difference when you are hungry ; and when you ai n't it ai n't no satisfaction to eat , anyway , and so a little grit in the meat ai n't no particular drawback , as far as I can see .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 18]: Then we struck the east end of the Desert at last , sailing on a northeast course .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 37]: Away off on the edge of the sand , in a soft pinky light , we see three little sharp roofs like tents , and Tom says : `` It 's the pyramids of Egypt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 7]: It made my heart fairly jump .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 61]: You see , I had seen a many and a many a picture of them , and heard tell about them a hundred times , and yet to come on them all of a sudden , that way , and find they was REAL , ` stead of imaginations , ` most knocked the breath out of me with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 54]: It 's a curious thing , that the more you hear about a grand and big and bully thing or person , the more it kind of dreamies out , as you may say , and gets to be a big dim wavery figger made out of moonshine and nothing solid to it .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 15]: It 's just so with George Washington , and the same with them pyramids .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 19]: And moreover , besides , the thing they always said about them seemed to me to be stretchers .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 68]: There was a feller come to the Sunday-school once , and had a picture of them , and made a speech , and said the biggest pyramid covered thirteen acres , and was most five hundred foot high , just a steep mountain , all built out of hunks of stone as big as a bureau , and laid up in perfectly regular layers , like stair-steps .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 16]: Thirteen acres , you see , for just one building ; it 's a farm .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 27]: If it had n't been in Sunday-school , I would ` a ' judged it was a lie ; and outside I was certain of it .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 65]: And he said there was a hole in the pyramid , and you could go in there with candles , and go ever so far up a long slanting tunnel , and come to a large room in the stomach of that stone mountain , and there you would find a big stone chest with a king in it , four thousand years old .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 37]: I said to myself , then , if that ai n't a lie I will eat that king if they will fetch him , for even Methusalem war n't that old , and nobody claims it .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 58]: As we come a little nearer we see the yaller sand come to an end in a long straight edge like a blanket , and on to it was joined , edge to edge , a wide country of bright green , with a snaky stripe crooking through it , and Tom said it was the Nile .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 20]: It made my heart jump again , for the Nile was another thing that was n't real to me .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 75]: Now I can tell you one thing which is dead certain : if you will fool along over three thousand miles of yaller sand , all glimmering with heat so that it makes your eyes water to look at it , and you 've been a considerable part of a week doing it , the green country will look so like home and heaven to you that it will make your eyes water AGAIN .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 13]: It was just so with me , and the same with Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 73]: And when Jim got so he could believe it WAS the land of Egypt he was looking at , he would n't enter it standing up , but got down on his knees and took off his hat , because he said it was n't fitten ' for a humble poor nigger to come any other way where such men had been as Moses and Joseph and Pharaoh and the other prophets .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 23]: He was a Presbyterian , and had a most deep respect for Moses which was a Presbyterian , too , he said .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 38]: He was all stirred up , and says : `` Hit 's de lan ' of Egypt , de lan ' of Egypt , en I 's ` lowed to look at it wid my own eyes !
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 81]: En dah 's de river dat was turn ' to blood , en I 's looking at de very same groun ' whah de plagues was , en de lice , en de frogs , en de locus ' , en de hail , en whah dey marked de door-pos ' , en de angel o ' de Lord come by in de darkness o ' de night en slew de fust-born in all de lan ' o ' Egypt .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 11]: Ole Jim ai n't worthy to see dis day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 14]: And then he just broke down and cried , he was so thankful .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 123]: So between him and Tom there was talk enough , Jim being excited because the land was so full of history -- Joseph and his brethren , Moses in the bulrushers , Jacob coming down into Egypt to buy corn , the silver cup in the sack , and all them interesting things ; and Tom just as excited too , because the land was so full of history that was in HIS line , about Noureddin , and Bedreddin , and such like monstrous giants , that made Jim 's wool rise , and a raft of other Arabian Nights folks , which the half of them never done the things they let on they done , I do n't believe .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 82]: Then we struck a disappointment , for one of them early morning fogs started up , and it war n't no use to sail over the top of it , because we would go by Egypt , sure , so we judged it was best to set her by compass straight for the place where the pyramids was gitting blurred and blotted out , and then drop low and skin along pretty close to the ground and keep a sharp lookout .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 35]: Tom took the hellum , I stood by to let go the anchor , and Jim he straddled the bow to dig through the fog with his eyes and watch out for danger ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 33]: We went along a steady gait , but not very fast , and the fog got solider and solider , so solid that Jim looked dim and ragged and smoky through it .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 13]: It was awful still , and we talked low and was anxious .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 22]: Now and then Jim would say : `` Highst her a p ` int , Mars Tom , highst her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 73]: and up she would skip , a foot or two , and we would slide right over a flat-roofed mud cabin , with people that had been asleep on it just beginning to turn out and gap and stretch ; and once when a feller was clear up on his hind legs so he could gap and stretch better , we took him a blip in the back and knocked him off .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 75]: By and by , after about an hour , and everything dead still and we a-straining our ears for sounds and holding our breath , the fog thinned a little , very sudden , and Jim sung out in an awful scare : `` Oh , for de lan 's sake , set her back , Mars Tom , here 's de biggest giant outen de ` Rabian Nights a-comin ' for us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 9]: and he went over backwards in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 47]: Tom slammed on the back-action , and as we slowed to a standstill a man 's face as big as our house at home looked in over the gunnel , same as a house looks out of its windows , and I laid down and died .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 64]: I must ` a ' been clear dead and gone for as much as a minute or more ; then I come to , and Tom had hitched a boat-hook on to the lower lip of the giant and was holding the balloon steady with it whilst he canted his head back and got a good long look up at that awful face .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 31]: Jim was on his knees with his hands clasped , gazing up at the thing in a begging way , and working his lips , but not getting anything out .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 32]: I took only just a glimpse , and was fading out again , but Tom says : `` He ai n't alive , you fools ; it 's the Sphinx ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 26]: I never see Tom look so little and like a fly ; but that was because the giant 's head was so big and awful .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 42]: Awful , yes , so it was , but not dreadful any more , because you could see it was a noble face , and kind of sad , and not thinking about you , but about other things and larger .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 31]: It was stone , reddish stone , and its nose and ears battered , and that give it an abused look , and you felt sorrier for it for that .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 20]: We stood off a piece , and sailed around it and over it , and it was just grand .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 37]: It was a man 's head , or maybe a woman 's , on a tiger 's body a hundred and twenty-five foot long , and there was a dear little temple between its front paws .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 34]: All but the head used to be under the sand , for hundreds of years , maybe thousands , but they had just lately dug the sand away and found that little temple .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 25]: It took a power of sand to bury that cretur ; most as much as it would to bury a steamboat , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 89]: We landed Jim on top of the head , with an American flag to protect him , it being a foreign land ; then we sailed off to this and that and t ` other distance , to git what Tom called effects and perspectives and proportions , and Jim he done the best he could , striking all the different kinds of attitudes and positions he could study up , but standing on his head and working his legs the way a frog does was the best .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 35]: The further we got away , the littler Jim got , and the grander the Sphinx got , till at last it was only a clothespin on a dome , as you might say .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 35]: That 's the way perspective brings out the correct proportions , Tom said ; he said Julus Cesar 's niggers did n't know how big he was , they was too close to him .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 79]: Then we sailed off further and further , till we could n't see Jim at all any more , and then that great figger was at its noblest , a-gazing out over the Nile Valley so still and solemn and lonesome , and all the little shabby huts and things that was scattered about it clean disappeared and gone , and nothing around it now but a soft wide spread of yaller velvet , which was the sand .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 13]: That was the right place to stop , and we done it .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 66]: We set there a-looking and a-thinking for a half an hour , nobody a-saying anything , for it made us feel quiet and kind of solemn to remember it had been looking over that valley just that same way , and thinking its awful thoughts all to itself for thousands of years , and nobody ca n't find out what they are to this day .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 49]: At last I took up the glass and see some little black things a-capering around on that velvet carpet , and some more a-climbing up the cretur 's back , and then I see two or three wee puffs of white smoke , and told Tom to look .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 12]: He done it , and says : `` They 're bugs .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 15]: No -- hold on ; they -- why , I believe they 're men .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 11]: Yes , it 's men -- men and horses both .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 19]: They 're hauling a long ladder up onto the Sphinx 's back -- now ai n't that odd ?
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 23]: And now they 're trying to lean it up a -- there 's some more puffs of smoke -- it 's guns !
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 8]: Huck , they 're after Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 12]: We clapped on the power , and went for them a-biling .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 39]: We was there in no time , and come a-whizzing down amongst them , and they broke and scattered every which way , and some that was climbing the ladder after Jim let go all holts and fell .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 28]: We soared up and found him laying on top of the head panting and most tuckered out , partly from howling for help and partly from scare .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 36]: He had been standing a siege a long time -- a week , HE said , but it war n't so , it only just seemed so to him because they was crowding him so .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 67]: They had shot at him , and rained the bullets all around him , but he war n't hit , and when they found he would n't stand up and the bullets could n't git at him when he was laying down , they went for the ladder , and then he knowed it was all up with him if we did n't come pretty quick .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 29]: Tom was very indignant , and asked him why he did n't show the flag and command them to GIT , in the name of the United States .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 13]: Jim said he done it , but they never paid no attention .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 50]: Tom said he would have this thing looked into at Washington , and says : `` You 'll see that they 'll have to apologize for insulting the flag , and pay an indemnity , too , on top of it even if they git off THAT easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 13]: Jim says : `` What 's an indemnity , Mars Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 12]: `` It 's cash , that 's what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 9]: `` Who gits it , Mars Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 7]: `` Why , WE do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 8]: `` En who gits de apology ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 5]: `` The United States .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 9]: Or , we can take whichever we please .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 22]: We can take the apology , if we want to , and let the gov ` ment take the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 12]: `` How much money will it be , Mars Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 29]: `` Well , in an aggravated case like this one , it will be at least three dollars apiece , and I do n't know but more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 19]: `` Well , den , we 'll take de money , Mars Tom , blame de ` pology .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 9]: Hai n't dat yo ' notion , too ?
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 9]: En hai n't it yourn , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 26]: We talked it over a little and allowed that that was as good a way as any , so we agreed to take the money .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 35]: It was a new business to me , and I asked Tom if countries always apologized when they had done wrong , and he says : `` Yes ; the little ones does . ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 41]: We was sailing around examining the pyramids , you know , and now we soared up and roosted on the flat top of the biggest one , and found it was just like what the man said in the Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 62]: It was like four pairs of stairs that starts broad at the bottom and slants up and comes together in a point at the top , only these stair-steps could n't be clumb the way you climb other stairs ; no , for each step was as high as your chin , and you have to be boosted up from behind .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 30]: The two other pyramids war n't far away , and the people moving about on the sand between looked like bugs crawling , we was so high above them .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 36]: Tom he could n't hold himself he was so worked up with gladness and astonishment to be in such a celebrated place , and he just dripped history from every pore , seemed to me .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 24]: He said he could n't scarcely believe he was standing on the very identical spot the prince flew from on the Bronze Horse .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 11]: It was in the Arabian Night times , he said .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 56]: Somebody give the prince a bronze horse with a peg in its shoulder , and he could git on him and fly through the air like a bird , and go all over the world , and steer it by turning the peg , and fly high or low and land wherever he wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 86]: When he got done telling it there was one of them uncomfortable silences that comes , you know , when a person has been telling a whopper and you feel sorry for him and wish you could think of some way to change the subject and let him down easy , but git stuck and do n't see no way , and before you can pull your mind together and DO something , that silence has got in and spread itself and done the business .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 19]: I was embarrassed , Jim he was embarrassed , and neither of us could n't say a word .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 20]: Well , Tom he glowered at me a minute , and says : `` Come , out with it .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 6]: What do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 16]: I says : `` Tom Sawyer , YOU do n't believe that , yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 9]: `` What 's the reason I do n't ?
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 7]: What 's to hender me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 19]: `` There 's one thing to hender you : it could n't happen , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 11]: `` What 's the reason it could n't happen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 11]: `` You tell me the reason it COULD happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 17]: `` This balloon is a good enough reason it could happen , I should reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 6]: `` WHY is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 5]: `` WHY is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 7]: I never saw such an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 16]: Ai n't this balloon and the bronze horse the same thing under different names ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 7]: `` No , they 're not .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 11]: One is a balloon and the other 's a horse .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 5]: It 's very different .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 16]: Next you 'll be saying a house and a cow is the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 12]: `` By Jackson , Huck 's got him ag ` in !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 10]: Dey ai n't no wigglin ' outer dat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 17]: `` Shut your head , Jim ; you do n't know what you 're talking about .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 5]: And Huck do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 18]: Look here , Huck , I 'll make it plain to you , so you can understand .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 37]: You see , it ai n't the mere FORM that 's got anything to do with their being similar or unsimilar , it 's the PRINCIPLE involved ; and the principle is the same in both .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 8]: Do n't you see , now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 20]: I turned it over in my mind , and says : `` Tom , it ai n't no use .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 39]: Principles is all very well , but they do n't git around that one big fact , that the thing that a balloon can do ai n't no sort of proof of what a horse can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 14]: `` Shucks , Huck , you do n't get the idea at all .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 11]: Now look here a minute -- it 's perfectly plain .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 9]: Do n't we fly through the air ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 15]: Do n't we fly high or fly low , just as we please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 12]: `` Do n't we steer whichever way we want to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 13]: `` And do n't we land when and where we please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 12]: `` How do we move the balloon and steer it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 7]: `` By touching the buttons . ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 13]: `` NOW I reckon the thing is clear to you at last .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 15]: In the other case the moving and steering was done by turning a peg .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 11]: We touch a button , the prince turned a peg .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 11]: There ai n't an atom of difference , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 18]: I knowed I could git it through your head if I stuck to it long enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 9]: He felt so happy he begun to whistle .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 31]: But me and Jim was silent , so he broke off surprised , and says : `` Looky here , Huck Finn , do n't you see it YET ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 16]: I says : `` Tom Sawyer , I want to ask you some questions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 17]: `` Go ahead , '' he says , and I see Jim chirk up to listen .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 25]: `` As I understand it , the whole thing is in the buttons and the peg -- the rest ai n't of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 20]: A button is one shape , a peg is another shape , but that ai n't any matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 21]: `` No , that ai n't any matter , as long as they 've both got the same power . ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 6]: `` All right , then .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 15]: What is the power that 's in a candle and in a match ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 7]: `` It 's the fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 11]: `` It 's the same in both , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 10]: `` Yes , just the same in both . ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 21]: Suppose I set fire to a carpenter shop with a match , what will happen to that carpenter shop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 7]: `` She 'll burn up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 19]: `` And suppose I set fire to this pyramid with a candle -- will she burn up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 8]: `` Of course she wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 10]: Now the fire 's the same , both times .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 13]: WHY does the shop burn , and the pyramid do n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 9]: `` Because the pyramid CA N'T burn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 3]: `` Aha !
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 8]: and A HORSE CA N'T FLY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 15]: `` My lan ' , ef Huck ai n't got him ag ` in !
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 14]: Huck 's landed him high en dry dis time , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 97]: Hit 's de smartes ' trap I ever see a body walk inter -- en ef I -- '' But Jim was so full of laugh he got to strangling and could n't go on , and Tom was that mad to see how neat I had floored him , and turned his own argument ag ` in him and knocked him all to rags and flinders with it , that all he could manage to say was that whenever he heard me and Jim try to argue it made him ashamed of the human race .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 12]: I never said nothing ; I was feeling pretty well satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 49]: When I have got the best of a person that way , it ai n't my way to go around crowing about it the way some people does , for I consider that if I was in his place I would n't wish him to crow over me .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 13]: It 's better to be generous , that 's what I think .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 97]: GOING FOR TOM 'S PIPE : BY AND BY we left Jim to float around up there in the neighborhood of the pyramids , and we clumb down to the hole where you go into the tunnel , and went in with some Arabs and candles , and away in there in the middle of the pyramid we found a room and a big stone box in it where they used to keep that king , just as the man in the Sunday-school said ; but he was gone , now ; somebody had got him .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 33]: But I did n't take no interest in the place , because there could be ghosts there , of course ; not fresh ones , but I do n't like no kind .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 83]: So then we come out and got some little donkeys and rode a piece , and then went in a boat another piece , and then more donkeys , and got to Cairo ; and all the way the road was as smooth and beautiful a road as ever I see , and had tall date-pa ` ms on both sides , and naked children everywhere , and the men was as red as copper , and fine and strong and handsome .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 7]: And the city was a curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 72]: Such narrow streets -- why , they were just lanes , and crowded with people with turbans , and women with veils , and everybody rigged out in blazing bright clothes and all sorts of colors , and you wondered how the camels and the people got by each other in such narrow little cracks , but they done it -- a perfect jam , you see , and everybody noisy .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 68]: The stores war n't big enough to turn around in , but you did n't have to go in ; the storekeeper sat tailor fashion on his counter , smoking his snaky long pipe , and had his things where he could reach them to sell , and he was just as good as in the street , for the camel-loads brushed him as they went by .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 38]: Now and then a grand person flew by in a carriage with fancy dressed men running and yelling in front of it and whacking anybody with a long rod that did n't get out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 43]: And by and by along comes the Sultan riding horseback at the head of a procession , and fairly took your breath away his clothes was so splendid ; and everybody fell flat and laid on his stomach while he went by .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 11]: I forgot , but a feller helped me to remember .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 12]: He was one that had a rod and run in front .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 22]: There was churches , but they do n't know enough to keep Sunday ; they keep Friday and break the Sabbath .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 12]: You have to take off your shoes when you go in .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 58]: There was crowds of men and boys in the church , setting in groups on the stone floor and making no end of noise -- getting their lessons by heart , Tom said , out of the Koran , which they think is a Bible , and people that knows better knows enough to not let on .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 58]: I never see such a big church in my life before , and most awful high , it was ; it made you dizzy to look up ; our village church at home ai n't a circumstance to it ; if you was to put it in there , people would think it was a drygoods box .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 28]: What I wanted to see was a dervish , because I was interested in dervishes on accounts of the one that played the trick on the camel-driver .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 26]: So we found a lot in a kind of a church , and they called themselves Whirling Dervishes ; and they did whirl , too .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 7]: I never see anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 53]: They had tall sugar-loaf hats on , and linen petticoats ; and they spun and spun and spun , round and round like tops , and the petticoats stood out on a slant , and it was the prettiest thing I ever see , and made me drunk to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 30]: They was all Moslems , Tom said , and when I asked him what a Moslem was , he said it was a person that was n't a Presbyterian .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 17]: So there is plenty of them in Missouri , though I did n't know it before .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 29]: We did n't see half there was to see in Cairo , because Tom was in such a sweat to hunt out places that was celebrated in history .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 65]: We had a most tiresome time to find the granary where Joseph stored up the grain before the famine , and when we found it it war n't worth much to look at , being such an old tumble-down wreck ; but Tom was satisfied , and made more fuss over it than I would make if I stuck a nail in my foot .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 12]: How he ever found that place was too many for me .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 48]: We passed as much as forty just like it before we come to it , and any of them would ` a ' done for me , but none but just the right one would suit him ; I never see anybody so particular as Tom Sawyer .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 45]: The minute he struck the right one he reconnized it as easy as I would reconnize my other shirt if I had one , but how he done it he could n't any more tell than he could fly ; he said so himself .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 55]: Then we hunted a long time for the house where the boy lived that learned the cadi how to try the case of the old olives and the new ones , and said it was out of the Arabian Nights , and he would tell me and Jim about it when he got time .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 60]: Well , we hunted and hunted till I was ready to drop , and I wanted Tom to give it up and come next day and git somebody that knowed the town and could talk Missourian and could go straight to the place ; but no , he wanted to find it himself , and nothing else would answer .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 5]: So on we went .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 11]: Then at last the remarkablest thing happened I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 23]: The house was gone -- gone hundreds of years ago -- every last rag of it gone but just one mud brick .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 39]: Now a person would n't ever believe that a backwoods Missouri boy that had n't ever been in that town before could go and hunt that place over and find that brick , but Tom Sawyer done it .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 13]: I know he done it , because I see him do it .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 23]: I was right by his very side at the time , and see him see the brick and see him reconnize it .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 13]: Well , I says to myself , how DOES he do it ?
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 9]: Is it knowledge , or is it instink ?
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 19]: Now there 's the facts , just as they happened : let everybody explain it their own way .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 29]: I 've ciphered over it a good deal , and it 's my opinion that some of it is knowledge but the main bulk of it is instink .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 63]: The reason is this : Tom put the brick in his pocket to give to a museum with his name on it and the facts when he went home , and I slipped it out and put another brick considerable like it in its place , and he did n't know the difference -- but there was a difference , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 14]: I think that settles it -- it 's mostly instink , not knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 35]: Instink tells him where the exact PLACE is for the brick to be in , and so he reconnizes it by the place it 's in , not by the look of the brick .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 31]: If it was knowledge , not instink , he would know the brick again by the look of it the next time he seen it -- which he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 28]: So it shows that for all the brag you hear about knowledge being such a wonderful thing , instink is worth forty of it for real unerringness .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 5]: Jim says the same .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 125]: When we got back Jim dropped down and took us in , and there was a young man there with a red skullcap and tassel on and a beautiful silk jacket and baggy trousers with a shawl around his waist and pistols in it that could talk English and wanted to hire to us as guide and take us to Mecca and Medina and Central Africa and everywheres for a half a dollar a day and his keep , and we hired him and left , and piled on the power , and by the time we was through dinner we was over the place where the Israelites crossed the Red Sea when Pharaoh tried to overtake them and was caught by the waters .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 23]: We stopped , then , and had a good look at the place , and it done Jim good to see it .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 76]: He said he could see it all , now , just the way it happened ; he could see the Israelites walking along between the walls of water , and the Egyptians coming , from away off yonder , hurrying all they could , and see them start in as the Israelites went out , and then when they was all in , see the walls tumble together and drown the last man of them .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 71]: Then we piled on the power again and rushed away and huvvered over Mount Sinai , and saw the place where Moses broke the tables of stone , and where the children of Israel camped in the plain and worshiped the golden calf , and it was all just as interesting as could be , and the guide knowed every place as well as I knowed the village at home .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 18]: But we had an accident , now , and it fetched all the plans to a standstill .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 37]: Tom 's old ornery corn-cob pipe had got so old and swelled and warped that she could n't hold together any longer , notwithstanding the strings and bandages , but caved in and went to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 9]: Tom he did n't know WHAT to do .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 53]: The professor 's pipe would n't answer ; it war n't anything but a mershum , and a person that 's got used to a cob pipe knows it lays a long ways over all the other pipes in this world , and you ca n't git him to smoke any other .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 12]: He would n't take mine , I could n't persuade him .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 5]: So there he was .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 49]: He thought it over , and said we must scour around and see if we could roust out one in Egypt or Arabia or around in some of these countries , but the guide said no , it war n't no use , they did n't have them .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 27]: So Tom was pretty glum for a little while , then he chirked up and said he 'd got the idea and knowed what to do .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 24]: He says : `` I 've got another corn-cob pipe , and it 's a prime one , too , and nearly new .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 19]: It 's laying on the rafter that 's right over the kitchen stove at home in the village .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 28]: Jim , you and the guide will go and get it , and me and Huck will camp here on Mount Sinai till you come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 14]: `` But , Mars Tom , we could n't ever find de village .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 37]: I could find de pipe , ` case I knows de kitchen , but my lan ' , we ca n't ever find de village , nur Sent Louis , nur none o ' dem places .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 11]: We do n't know de way , Mars Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 13]: That was a fact , and it stumped Tom for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 22]: Then he said : `` Looky here , it can be done , sure ; and I 'll tell you how .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 20]: You set your compass and sail west as straight as a dart , till you find the United States .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 22]: It ai n't any trouble , because it 's the first land you 'll strike the other side of the Atlantic .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 51]: If it 's daytime when you strike it , bulge right on , straight west from the upper part of the Florida coast , and in an hour and three quarters you 'll hit the mouth of the Mississippi -- at the speed that I 'm going to send you .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 56]: You 'll be so high up in the air that the earth will be curved considerable -- sorter like a washbowl turned upside down -- and you 'll see a raft of rivers crawling around every which way , long before you get there , and you can pick out the Mississippi without any trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 36]: Then you can follow the river north nearly , an hour and three quarters , till you see the Ohio come in ; then you want to look sharp , because you 're getting near .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 25]: Away up to your left you 'll see another thread coming in -- that 's the Missouri and is a little above St. Louis .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 19]: You 'll come down low then , so as you can examine the villages as you spin along .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 35]: You 'll pass about twenty-five in the next fifteen minutes , and you 'll recognize ours when you see it -- and if you do n't , you can yell down and ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 25]: `` Ef it 's dat easy , Mars Tom , I reckon we kin do it -- yassir , I knows we kin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 24]: The guide was sure of it , too , and thought that he could learn to stand his watch in a little while .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 18]: `` Jim can learn you the whole thing in a half an hour , '' Tom said .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 13]: `` This balloon 's as easy to manage as a canoe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 30]: Tom got out the chart and marked out the course and measured it , and says : `` To go back west is the shortest way , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 8]: It 's only about seven thousand miles .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 18]: If you went east , and so on around , it 's over twice as far . ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 50]: Then he says to the guide , `` I want you both to watch the tell-tale all through the watches , and whenever it do n't mark three hundred miles an hour , you go higher or drop lower till you find a storm-current that 's going your way .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 17]: There 's a hundred miles an hour in this old thing without any wind to help .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 18]: There 's two-hundred-mile gales to be found , any time you want to hunt for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 10]: `` We 'll hunt for them , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 6]: `` See that you do .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 36]: Sometimes you may have to go up a couple of miles , and it 'll be p ` ison cold , but most of the time you 'll find your storm a good deal lower .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 15]: If you can only strike a cyclone -- that 's the ticket for you !
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 24]: You 'll see by the professor 's books that they travel west in these latitudes ; and they travel low , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 33]: Then he ciphered on the time , and says -- `` Seven thousand miles , three hundred miles an hour -- you can make the trip in a day -- twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 12]: This is Thursday ; you 'll be back here Saturday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 26]: Come , now , hustle out some blankets and food and books and things for me and Huck , and you can start right along .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 25]: There ai n't no occasion to fool around -- I want a smoke , and the quicker you fetch that pipe the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 23]: All hands jumped for the things , and in eight minutes our things was out and the balloon was ready for America .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 27]: So we shook hands good-bye , and Tom gave his last orders : `` It 's 10 minutes to 2 P.M. now , Mount Sinai time .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 19]: In 24 hours you 'll be home , and it 'll be 6 to-morrow morning , village time .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 61]: When you strike the village , land a little back of the top of the hill , in the woods , out of sight ; then you rush down , Jim , and shove these letters in the post-office , and if you see anybody stirring , pull your slouch down over your face so they wo n't know you .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 61]: Then you go and slip in the back way to the kitchen and git the pipe , and lay this piece of paper on the kitchen table , and put something on it to hold it , and then slide out and git away , and do n't let Aunt Polly catch a sight of you , nor nobody else .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 17]: Then you jump for the balloon and shove for Mount Sinai three hundred miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 10]: You wo n't have lost more than an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 32]: You 'll start back at 7 or 8 A.M. , village time , and be here in 24 hours , arriving at 2 or 3 P.M. , Mount Sinai time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 10]: Tom he read the piece of paper to us .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 10]: He had wrote on it : `` THURSDAY AFTERNOON .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 35]: Tom Sawyer the Erro-nort sends his love to Aunt Polly from Mount Sinai where the Ark was , and so does Huck Finn , and she will get it to-morrow morning half-past six . ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 18]: * -LSB- * This misplacing of the Ark is probably Huck 's error , not Tom 's .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 20]: -- M.T. -RSB- `` That 'll make her eyes bulge out and the tears come , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 8]: Then he says : `` Stand by !
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 11]: One -- two -- three -- away you go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 6]: And away she DID go !
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 13]: Why , she seemed to whiz out of sight in a second .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 26]: Then we found a most comfortable cave that looked out over the whole big plain , and there we camped to wait for the pipe .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 36]: The balloon come hack all right , and brung the pipe ; but Aunt Polly had catched Jim when he was getting it , and anybody can guess what happened : she sent for Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 45]: So Jim he says : `` Mars Tom , she 's out on de porch wid her eye sot on de sky a-layin ' for you , en she say she ai n't gwyne to budge from dah tell she gits hold of you .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 16]: Dey 's gwyne to be trouble , Mars Tom , ` deed dey is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 15]: So then we shoved for home , and not feeling very gay , neither .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 2]: END .
