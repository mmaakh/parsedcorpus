Parsing [sent. 28 len. 33]: _ Frontispiece _ Scenes from the photo-drama Scenes from the photo-drama Scenes from the photo-drama ONE WONDERFUL NIGHT CHAPTER I DUSK `` There , sonny -- behold the city of your dreams !
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 11]: Good old New York , as per schedule ... Gee !
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 6]: Ai n't she great ? ''
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 52]: The slim , self-possessed youth of twenty hardly seemed to expect an answer ; but the man addressed in this pert manner , though the senior of the pair by six years , felt that the emotion throbbing in his heart must be allowed to bubble forth lest he became hysterical .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 11]: `` Old New York , do you call it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 4]: he asked quietly .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 101]: The tense restraint in his voice would perhaps have betrayed his mood to a more delicately tuned ear than his companion 's , but young Howard Devar , heir of the Devar millions -- son of `` Vancouver '' Devar , the Devar who fed multitudes on canned salmon , and was suspected of having cornered wheat at least once , thus woefully misapplying the parable of the loaves and fishes -- had the wit to appreciate the significance of the question , deaf as he was to its note of longing , of adulation , of vibrant sentiment . ''
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 35]: _ Coelum non animum mutat _ , which , in good American , means that it is the same old city on the level , and only changes its sky-line , '' he chortled .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 47]: `` Bet you a five-spot to a nickel I 'll walk blindfolded along Twenty-third Street from the Hoboken Ferry any time of the day , and take the correct turn into Broadway , bar being run over by a taxi or street-car at the crossings . ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 12]: `` I 'll take the same odds and do that myself .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 16]: How could any normal human being miss the rattle of the Sixth Avenue Elevated ? ''
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 7]: Devar 's forehead wrinkled with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 5]: `` Hello , there !
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 3]: Hold on !
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 20]: How often have you told me that you had never seen New York since you were a baby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 48]: `` Nor have I. Ten years ago , almost to a day , I sailed from Boston to Europe with my people , and I had never revisited New York after leaving it in infancy , though both my father and mother hailed from the Bronx . ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 18]: `` There 's a cog missing somewhere , or my mental gear-box is out of shape . ''
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 7]: `` Not a bit of it .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 12]: One may learn heaps of things from maps and books . ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 37]: `` Start right in , then , and take an honors course , for behold in me a map and a book and a high-grade society index for the whole blessed little island of Manhattan . ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 16]: What is that slender , column-like structure to the left of the Singer Building ? ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 16]: Devar gazed hard at the graceful tower indicated by his friend ; then he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 17]: `` Oh , you 're uncanny , that 's what you are , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 20]: `` You 've lived so long in the East that you 've imbibed its tricks of occultism and necromancy .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 24]: I suppose you have discovered in some way that that mushroom has sprung up since the old man sent me to Heidelberg ? ''
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 8]: `` I guessed it , I admit .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 17]: It does not figure among the down-town sky-scrapers in the latest drawing available in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 23]: `` And d'ye mean to tell me that you can pick out any of these top-notchers merely by studying a picture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 19]: Probably you could do the same if you , like me , felt yourself a returned exile . ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 18]: Young Devar awoke at last to the fact that his companion was brimming over with subdued excitement .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 34]: Whether this arose from the intense nationalism of an expatriated American , or from some more subtle personal cause , he could not determine , but , being young , he was cynical .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 63]: He looked at the strong , set face , the well-knit , sinewy figure , the purposeful hands gripping the fore rail of the promenade deck ; then he growled , with just the least spice of humorous envy : `` Say , Curtis , old man , you ought to have a hell of a good time in New York ! ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 20]: `` At any rate , I shall not suffer from lack of enthusiasm , '' came the quick retort .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 27]: Devar felt the spur , and his restless , bird-like eyes condescended to dwell for a few seconds in silence on the splendid panorama in front .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 42]: The _ Lusitania _ had passed through the Narrows before the two young men had strolled along the upper deck of the great steamship to the ` vantage point of a gangway which made a half-circle around the commander 's quarters .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 44]: Already the Statue of Liberty loomed majestically over the port bow , and the wide expanse of the Hudson River was framed by the wooded slopes of Staten Island , the low shores of New Jersey , and the heights of the Palisades .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 35]: Somewhat to the right rose the imperial outlines of newest New York , that wonderful city which , even in the memory of children , has raised itself hundreds of feet nearer the sky .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 22]: A thin , blue haze gave glamour to a delightful scene , glowing in the declining rays of a November sun .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 42]: The gigantic strands of the Brooklyn Bridge showed through it like some aerial path to a fabulous land , while , merging fast in the shadows , other dim specters told of even greater engineering marvels higher up the East River .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 94]: A fleet of bustling vessels , for the most part ferry-boats and tugs of every possible size and shape , scudded across the spacious waterways , and lent to the picture exactly that semblance of vitality , of energetic purpose , of relentless effort to be up and doing -- whether the New Yorker was going home from his office , or his wife was coming into town for dinner and a theater -- which one , at least , of the city 's uncounted sons had confidently expected to find in it .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 54]: So John Delancy Curtis drew a deep breath that sounded almost like a sigh , but a pleasant smile illumined his somewhat stern face as he turned to Devar and said : `` I am giving myself fourteen days ' free run of the town before I go West to visit some relatives .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 8]: They live in Indiana , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 12]: Bloomington , Monroe County , is the latest address I possess .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 9]: Do n't forget to ring me up to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 14]: You remember the hotel , the Central , in West 27th Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 7]: `` Oh , forget it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 5]: cried the other vexedly .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 14]: `` Why in the world are you burying yourself in that pre-historic shanty ?
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 76]: Man alive , the Holland House is only a block away , and there are ` steen hotels of the right sort strung out along Fifth Avenue , ` way up to Central Park -- '' `` It 's just a whim , '' broke in Curtis , who did not feel like explaining at the moment that he was choosing a quiet old inn in a side street because he had been born there !
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 37]: Nevertheless , his words held that ring of decision , of finality in judgment , which invariably forms part of the equipment of men who have lived in wild lands and lorded it over inferior races .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 19]: Devar was vaguely conscious , and perhaps slightly resentful , of this compelling quality in his new-found crony .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 53]: Oft-times it had quelled him for an instant during some stubbornly contested argument , though he raged at himself just as often for yielding to it , as if , forsooth , he were one of those patient , animal-like , Chinese coolies of whose courage and endurance Curtis spoke so admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 14]: Yet he was drawn to the man , and clung to his friendship .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 3]: `` Right-o !
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 22]: I s ` pose the place owns a telephone , '' he snickered , and then hurried away to finish packing .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 29]: Curtis , whose belongings were locked and strapped hours ago , remained on deck , and watched the preparations for bringing the great liner alongside the Cunard pier .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 20]: When her engines were stopped in mid-stream a number of fussy little tugs began nosing her round to starboard .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 45]: It seemed a matter of sheer impossibility that these puny creatures should move such a monster ; but faith can move mountains , and in half an hour , or less , the tugs had moved the _ Lusitania _ to her allotted berth .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 20]: Meanwhile , in each wide arch of the Customs shed , parterres of joyous faces grew momentarily more distinct .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 27]: It was easy to discern the very instant when one or other eager group on shore recognized the features of relatives and friends on the ship .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 40]: A frenzied waving of handkerchiefs , small flags , or umbrellas , an occasional wild whoop , a college cry or a rebel yell , would evoke similar demonstrations from the packed lines of onlookers fringing the lower decks .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 17]: One fact was dominant -- to the vast majority of the passengers , this was home .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 15]: Suddenly , Curtis found that he was the sole tenant of the open promenade .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 40]: Everyone on board had hurried to the less exalted levels , the many to hail their loved ones , the few to watch that first unique demonstration of welcome to a new land which New York gives so generously .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 32]: Somehow , he had never felt himself more alone -- not even by night in the solemn plains of Manchuria -- and he threw off the feeling , almost with contempt .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 8]: Was not this city his very own ?
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 17]: Had he not a birthright in every stone of it , from pavement to loftiest pinnacle ?
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 43]: This was _ his _ home-coming , too , more real , more literally complete , than in the case of any but the few born New Yorkers who might figure among the two thousand passengers carried by the _ Lusitania _ .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 20]: Insistently claiming his share of recognition , he turned abruptly , and made his way to the third deck .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 26]: There he met a lady , a young bride , who was returning to the States with her husband after a prolonged tour through Europe .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 25]: Her pretty face was wrung with emotion , but a second glance revealed that her distress was due to the pleasant pain of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 10]: `` Have you seen your father and mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 19]: he asked sympathetically , knowing that she had looked forward to this great hour with so much longing .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 7]: `` Y-yes , '' she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 7]: `` They are there -- somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 5]: B-but , oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 11]: I can not see them now for my tears . ''
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 10]: Someone dug a joyful thumb into Curtis 's ribs .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 7]: It was the girl 's husband .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 12]: `` Gee , it 's fine to be home again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 4]: he said huskily .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 62]: `` Your leaning towers of Pisa are all right by way of a change , but deal me the Metropolitan for keeps , an ' I 've just spotted my old dad grinning at me like a Cheshire cat from the middle of a crowd wedged so tight that it would take a panic to squeeze in an extra walking-stick . ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 43]: So the knowledge was borne in on Curtis that one could feel quite as lonely on C Deck as on A , and , case-hardened wanderer that he was , he badly wanted someone to yell at gleefully among the waiting multitude .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 15]: Now the gangways were out , and West folded East in her willing arms .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 35]: The stolid masses of steamship and Customs shed obliterated the orange and crimson sky still gleaming over the Jersey shore , and pallid electric lights revealed but vaguely the ever-changing groups beyond the gangways .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 21]: To an experienced traveler like Curtis all Custom-houses were alike , dingy , nerve-racking , superfluous clogs on free movement .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 62]: Taking his time , for he had none to embrace or greet with outstretched hand , he strolled quietly off the ship , collected his baggage , which was piled with other people 's belongings under a big `` C , '' and nodded to Devar , similarly engaged at `` D. '' The boy ran to him for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 12]: `` I may look you up to-night , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 15]: `` Dad is in Chicago , and wo n't be here till the morning .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 25]: You remember we passed the _ Switzerland _ after breakfast , and she signaled that she was steaming with the port engine only ? ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 23]: `` Well , her trouble was known by wireless , and there is a man on board whom dad has to meet .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 5]: This chap is important .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 5]: I am not . ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 50]: `` My dear fellow , do n't think of leaving your friends on my account this evening , '' and Curtis , without looking around , showed that he had noticed the befurred elderly lady and two very pretty daughters who were taking Howard Devar under their elegant wings .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 14]: `` Oh , that 's my aunt , and two of my cousins .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 13]: I have dozens of 'em , dozens of cousins , that is .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 23]: Anyhow , old sport , do n't wait in after 7.30 ; just leave word where you may be about eleven . ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 19]: No further protest by Curtis was possible , because Devar 's present behavior was of the whirlwind order .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 21]: He seemed to own as many trunks as cousins , and a lantern-jawed Customs official was gloating over them already .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 25]: Perhaps Curtis felt a faint whiff of surprise that his young friend had not introduced him to his relatives , but it vanished instantly .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 23]: Steamer acquaintance is a nebulous thing at the best ; in that respect , the land is more unstable than the sea .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 77]: At last , the stranger in his own country was consigned to a porter , his two steamer trunks , a kit-bag , a suit-case , and a bundle of worn golf clubs were placed on a taxi , and a breath of clean , cold air blew in on his face as the vehicle hurried along West Street , that broad and exceedingly useful thoroughfare which New York has finally wrested from its waterside slums .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 25]: The chief city of America is fortunate in the fact that a noble harbor presents her in full regalia to the voyager from Europe .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 46]: That favorable first impression , unattainable by the majority of the world 's capitals , is never lost , and now it enabled Curtis to disregard the garish ugliness of the avenues and streets glimpsed during a quick run to the center of the town .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 34]: For one thing , he realized how the mere propinquity of docks and wharves infects entire districts with the happy-go-lucky carelessness of Jack ashore ; for another , he knew what was coming .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 22]: Or he fancied that he knew , a state of mind which , particularly in New York , produces brain storms .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 51]: His first shock came when the taxi drew up in front of a narrow-fronted , exceedingly tall building , equipped with revolving doors , while a hall-porter , dressed like an archduke , peered through the window and inquired severely : `` Have you reserved a room , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 49]: Yes , this was the Central Hotel , rebuilt , gone skyward , in full cry after its more pretentious _ à la carte _ neighbors , and the hall-porter was pained by the mere suspicion that the fact was not accepted of all the world of travel .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 46]: Although the newcomer confessed that he had not made any reservation of rooms , the Archduke graciously permitted him to alight -- indeed , quelled an incipient rebellion on Curtis 's part by ordering a couple of negroes to disappear with most of the baggage .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 22]: So Curtis announced meekly to a super-clerk that he wanted a room with a bathroom , and was allowed to register .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 51]: As in a dream , he signed `` John D. Curtis , Pekin , '' and was promptly annoyed at finding what he had written , because , being a citizen of New York , he had meant to claim the distinction , and ignore his long years in Cathay .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 19]: `` You 'll find 605 a comfortable , quiet room , Mr. Curtis , '' said the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 13]: `` Going to make a long stay , may I ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 9]: `` A few days -- perhaps a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 7]: I can not say offhand . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 16]: `` Well , sir , I ca n't fix you better than in 605 . ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 15]: From some points of view , the clerk had never uttered a truer word .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 39]: It was wholly impossible that he or Curtis should guess how an apparently empty and really excellent apartment in the Central Hotel should be full to the ceiling that evening with that dynamite in human affairs called chance .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 61]: If the slightest inkling of the forthcoming explosion could have been vouchsafed to both men , there is no telling what Curtis might have done , for he was a true adventurer , of the D'Artagnan genus , but the clerk would certainly have used all his persuasiveness to induce the guest to occupy some other part of the house .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 26]: In later periods of unruffled calm , he was wont to date from that moment the genesis of gray hairs among his once raven-hued locks .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 28]: But chance , like dynamite , not only gives no warning of its explosive properties but resembles that agent of disruption in following a curiously wayward path .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 47]: Curtis was piloted into an elevator by an affable negro , was conducted to 605 , which , of course , lay on the sixth floor , and was plunged forthwith into the prosaic business of consigning a good deal of soiled linen to the laundry .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 25]: The room was insufferably hot , so he directed the negro attendant to shut off the radiator , and himself threw open the window .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 20]: Glancing out , he discovered that he was located in a corner which commanded a distant glimpse of Broadway .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 61]: Directly before his eyes , in the topmost story of a comparatively low building , a lady who had forgotten to draw the blinds of her flat was apparently indulging in calisthenic exercises , so Curtis , being a modest man , drew the blind in his own room , and busied himself with a partial unpacking of his baggage .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 14]: The door faced the bed , at a distance of some six feet .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 59]: A wardrobe occupied the recess , and the negro , while unstrapping a steel trunk at the foot of the bed , balanced the bag of golf clubs against the front of the wardrobe -- an action simple enough in itself , but comparable in its after effects to the setting of a clock attached to a bomb .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 25]: Soon afterwards , Curtis dismissed the man , and noticed casually that the opening of the door caused a pleasant draught of cool air .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 47]: He wrote a few letters , dressed , electing for a Tuxedo and black tie , filled a cigar-case , donned a green Homburg hat , threw an overcoat over his left arm , picked up the letters , extinguished the lights , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 42]: Again there came that rush of air from the window , and , just as the lock snapped , a crash from the interior announced the falling of the golf clubs , probably owing to a swaying of the wardrobe door .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 14]: Simultaneously , Curtis realized that he had left the key on the dressing-table .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 50]: It was hardly worth while searching the floor for a chamber-maid : he decided to inform the civil-spoken clerk , and have the key brought to the office , at which sapient resolve Puck , who was surely abroad in New York that night , must have chuckled delightedly .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 40]: Unhappily , there were other spirits brooding in the city , spirits before whose deathly scowls the prime mischief-maker would have fled in terror , and Curtis , all unwitting , brushed against one of them in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 26]: His only acquaintance , the clerk , was momentarily absent , so he turned to a bookstall and cigar counter , and bought some stamps .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 37]: A man who had been seated in a sort of café , which the news-stand and a flower-stall partially screened from the main hall , rose hurriedly when he saw Curtis , and purchased a cigar .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 19]: In doing so , he touched the young man 's shoulder , and said : `` Pardon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 26]: Curtis turned , and looked into the singularly unprepossessing face of a swarthy foreigner , a powerfully-built , ungainly person of about his own age .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 14]: `` That 's all right , '' said he , licking a stamp .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 41]: `` I jostled you by accident , monsieur , '' said the other , in correct French , though with a quaint accent which Curtis , himself no mean linguist , put down to a Polish or Czech nationality . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 28]: _ Ca ne fait rien _ , '' he replied civilly , and the stamping of the letters being completed , he took them to the letter-box .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 29]: The stranger , who seemed to be rather puzzled , if somewhat reassured , dawdled over the lighting of the cigar , and watched Curtis enter the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 11]: Then he went back to his chair in the café .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 31]: So much , and no more , did the youth in charge of the counter observe -- not a great deal , but it went a long way before midnight .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 15]: A clock in the hall showed that the hour was five minutes to seven .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 32]: Half hoping that Devar might actually put in an appearance a little later , Curtis gave his hat and coat to a negro , and decided to dine in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 16]: Evidently , the place still retained its old-time repute as a family and commercial resort .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 50]: The family element was in evidence at some of the tables , while , in the case of solitary diners , each man could have been labeled Pittsburg , Chicago , or Philadelphia , almost without error , by those acquainted with the industrial life of the United States .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 19]: He ate well , if simply , and treated himself to a small bottle of a noted champagne .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 23]: At half-past seven , meaning to give Devar ten minutes ' grace , he ordered coffee and a glass of green Chartreuse .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 41]: As a time-killer , there is no liqueur more potent , but , regarded in the light of subsequent occurrences , it would be hard to say exactly how far the cunning monkish decoction helped in determining his wayward actions .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 28]: Undoubtedly , some fantastic influence carried him beyond those bounds of calm self-possession within which everyone who knew John Delancy Curtis would have expected to find him .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 85]: His subsequent light-headedness , his placid acceptance of a mad romance as the one thing that was inevitable , his ready yielding to impulse , his no less stubborn refusal to return to the beaten path of common sense -- these unlikely traits in a character gifted with the New England dourness of purpose can only be explained , if at all , as arising from some unsuspected hereditary streak of knight-errantry brought into sudden and exotic life by the good wines of France .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 66]: Be that as it may , at twenty minutes to eight he paid what he owed , lighted a cigar , donned his hat , and , still carrying the overcoat , was walking to the office to leave word about the key , when his attention was attracted by the peculiar behavior of the man who had pushed against him at the cigar counter .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 35]: This person , apparently obeying a signal from another man of his own type who had just emerged from the elevator , hastened from the café , and the two ran to the door .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 30]: Now , the weather had been mild during the afternoon , and the revolving shutters of the doorway were folded back to allow of the overheated hall being cooled .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 32]: A porter stood there , and it was ascertained afterwards that , noticing a certain air of flurry and confusion about the foreigners , he asked if they wanted a taxi .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 21]: They gave no heed , but continued to gaze up and down the street , as though they awaited someone .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 16]: Equally did they seem to expect , or dread , an apparition from the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 25]: It would have been hard to pick out , at that instant , two persons more singularly ill at ease in all New York .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 38]: Curtis saw that the clerk , now at his desk , was engaged with a lady , so he strolled to the door , being rather interested in the excited antics of the pair on the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 37]: He had just passed through the door when an automobile dashed up , and he fancied , though he could not be quite sure in the half-light , that the chauffeur nodded to the waiting men .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 25]: The porter opened the door of the automobile , and a young man in evening dress , and carrying an overcoat , leaped out .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 26]: Obviously , he was in a desperate hurry , and Curtis heard him say in French : `` Do n't stop the engine , Anatole .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 8]: I shall be but one moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 10]: At that instant the two foreigners sprang at him .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 32]: One , swinging the porter off his feet , seized the newcomer 's right arm , and , helped by his comrade , endeavored to force him back into the vehicle .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 24]: The effort failed , however , so the second desperado drew a knife and plunged it deliberately into the unfortunate man 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 31]: It was a fearsome stroke , intended both to silence and to kill , and , with a gurgling cry , its victim collapsed in the grip of his assailants .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 27]: Curtis , though almost stupefied by the suddenness of the crime , did not hesitate a second when he caught the venomous gleam of the knife .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 44]: Throwing aside his coat , he rushed forward , but he had to cross the whole width of the pavement , and the murderers , realizing that the capture of one or both was imminent , thrust the inert body in his way .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 58]: The chauffeur , who must have seen all that happened , had already started the car , the two men scrambled into it , and all that Curtis could do was to run after it and shout frantically to the driver of a taxi coming in the opposite direction to turn his vehicle and block the roadway .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 25]: The man understood , but was naturally slow to risk a sharp collision merely at the order of an excited gentleman in evening dress .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 45]: He stopped quickly enough , but , by the time his help was available , pursuit was hopeless ; the one thing Curtis could do he had done -- while running up the street he had deciphered the number of the car , X24-305 .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 26]: Before Curtis rejoined the dazed hall-porter a small crowd had gathered , and it was difficult to get near the body lying on the curb .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 39]: A man picked up an overcoat , and Curtis , cool and clear-headed now , took it , and appealed to him , if he knew where the nearest doctor lived , to run thither at top speed .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 6]: The man obeyed him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 15]: `` Meanwhile , let me see to the poor fellow , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 25]: `` I am not a doctor , but I know enough about wounds to say whether those scoundrels have killed him or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 32]: The throng yielded to an authoritative voice , and some of the more sensible bystanders formed a ring , thus securing a semblance of light and air around the prostrate man .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 34]: Curtis struck a match , and it needed no second glance to learn that the stranger 's lung had been pierced by an almost vertical thrust ; indeed , he was already dying .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 34]: The poor lips , from which blood and froth were bubbling , strove vainly to articulate words which , in the prevalent hubbub of alarm and excitement , it was impossible to distinguish .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 41]: A policeman came , and , as a traffic station for the precinct happened to lie within a couple of doors , the moribund form was carried in , and placed on a stretcher kept there for use in emergency .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 26]: A doctor was soon on the spot , but he arrived just in time to record the last flicker of life in the tortured eyes .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 61]: Then , as one in a dream , Curtis gave the policeman the details of the crime , the name of the chauffeur , and the number of the car , his testimony being borne out to some extent by the hall-porter , and , so far as the car was concerned , by the sharp-eyed driver of the taxi .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 61]: His own name and address were taken , and a police captain and a couple of detectives , called to the scene by telephone , thanked him for his alertness in securing valuable clews , not only in regard to the car and chauffeur but also in describing the features , figure , and dress of one of the criminals .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 45]: Finally , he was warned to hold himself in readiness to attend the opening of an inquest on the following morning , and the police intimated that they did not desire the presence of witnesses while the dead man 's clothing was being scrutinized .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 35]: So Curtis went out into the street , and , with no other purpose than to avoid the publicity and questioning of the crowd gathered in and around the hotel , sauntered into Broadway .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 14]: At the corner he halted for a moment to put on the overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 48]: He had gone some few yards up the brilliantly illuminated thoroughfare when he fancied that his nervous system needed the tonic of a cigar , and he searched in the pockets of the overcoat for a box of matches he had placed there before leaving his bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 31]: The box had gone , but in the right-hand pocket his fingers closed on a long , narrow envelope , made of stiff linen paper , which somehow seemed unfamiliar .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 18]: He drew it out , and examined it , standing in front of a well-lighted shop window .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 12]: Then he whistled with sheer amazement , as well he might .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 49]: The envelope held a marriage license for two people named Jean de Courtois and Hermione Beauregard Grandison ... In a word , he was wearing the dead man 's overcoat , and the fearsome conviction leaped to his brain that the dead man must be Jean de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 30]: CHAPTER II EIGHT O'CLOCK From one aspect , Curtis 's sense of dread and horror was merely altruistic , the natural welling forth of the springs of human sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 42]: If the man now lying stark and lifeless in that dreary official bureau had in truth been hurrying on his way to a marriage feast , then , indeed , tragedy had assumed its grimmest aspect that night in New York .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 48]: But , beyond an enforced personal contact with a ghastly crime , Curtis had no vital interest in its victim , and it should have occurred to him , as a law-abiding citizen , that his instant duty was to communicate this new discovery to the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 18]: Nay more , such definite information would help the police materially in their pursuit of the murderers .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 28]: It might lay bare a motive , put the bloodhounds of the law on a well-marked trail , and render impossible the escape of the guilty ones .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 49]: That was the sane , level-headed , man-of-the-world view , and , to one inured to deeds of violence in a land where the Foreign Devil oft-time holds his life as scarce worth an hour 's purchase , no other solution of the problem should have presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 25]: But , for all his strength of character , Curtis had been breathing an intoxicating atmosphere ever since he set foot on American soil .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 20]: His home-coming had begun by producing in his soul a subtle exaltation which had survived a conspiracy of repression .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 118]: Devar 's careless acceptance of the city 's grandeur had jarred ; the exuberance of the joyous throng on the jetty had touched dormant chords of sad memories ; even at the very portals of the hotel the building 's newness had struck a bizarre note ; and now , as though to emphasize the vile crime of which he had been an involuntary witness , came the stifling knowledge that somewhere in New York an expectant bride was chafing at delay -- a delay caused by an assassin 's dagger , while there was not lacking even the tormenting suspicion that somehow , had he been more wide-awake , he could have prevented that malignant thrust .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 9]: Yet , his head remained in the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 37]: In common with most men whose lot is cast in climes far removed from civilization , Curtis worshiped an ideal of womanhood which was rather that of a poet than of the blasé , cynical town-dweller .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 51]: He had seen death too often to be shocked by its harsh visage , and , perhaps in protest against the idle belief that the crime was preventable , his sympathies were absorbed now by the vision of some fair girl waiting vainly for the bridegroom who would never come .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 18]: His analytical mind fastened instantly on the theory that murder had been done to prevent a marriage .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 36]: He took it for granted that the Jean de Courtois of the marriage certificate was dead , and his heart grieved for the hapless young woman whose aristocratic name was blazoned on that same document .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 46]: So , instead of retracing his steps , and warning the officers of the law , he bent his brows over the certificate , and , in acting thus , unconsciously committed himself to as fantastic a course as ever was followed by mortal man .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 48]: It is only fair to urge that had he known the truth , had the veil been lifted ever so slightly on other happenings in the Central Hotel that night , he would not have hesitated a moment about returning to the conclave of policemen and detectives .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 42]: He acted impulsively , absurdly , almost insanely , it may be held , but he did honestly act in good faith , and that is the best and the worst that can be said of him , or for him .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 26]: And now to peer over his shoulder at the printed form and its written interlineations , which he was perusing with anxious , thoughtful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 99]: It was headed `` State of New York , County of New York , City of New York , '' and bade all men know that any person authorized by law to perform marriage ceremonies within the State was thereby `` authorized and empowered to solemnize the rites of matrimony between Jean de Courtois , a citizen of the French Republic , now residing in the Central Hotel , West 27th Street , New York , and Hermione Beauregard Grandison , a citizen of Great Britain , now residing at 1000 West 59th Street , New York . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 11]: It had been issued that very day , November 8th .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 28]: Annexed to the license was the actual marriage certificate , with blanks for names and dates , to be filled in by the person performing the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 79]: A set of printed rules , reciting various duties , legal obligations , and penalties for infringing the same , was also inclosed ; but Curtis was in no mood to master the provisions of `` An Act to Amend the Domestic Relations Law , by providing for Marriage Licenses , '' for they must perforce be silent on the one topic wherein he needed guidance -- the course to be pursued in the circumstances now facing him .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 71]: His thoughts were focussed on the name and address of the girl who had been so cruelly , so wantonly , bereft of her lover , and it seemed to him both fitting and charitable that someone other than a police sergeant or detective should interpose between the grim tragedy of 27th Street and the even more poignant horror which was fated to descend on some house in 59th Street .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 31]: Apparently , fate had decreed that he should be the messenger charged with this sad errand , and , with a singular disregard of consequences , he accepted the mandate .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 6]: He did not act blindly .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 18]: When all was said and done , the certificate had come into his possession by unavoidable chance .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 33]: At the hapless bride 's residence he would surely be able to meet someone who could accompany him to the police office , and give the details needed for a successful chase .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 45]: Indeed , he argued that he was saving valuable time by his prompt action , and , reviewing the whole of the facts while being carried swiftly up Broadway in a taxi , he found , at first , no flaw in his judgment .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 32]: Though busy in mind with the extraordinary events of the past quarter of an hour , his alert eyes missed few features of the abounding life of the Great White Way .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 39]: As it happened , a stranger in New York could not have entered the city 's main thoroughfare at any point better calculated to bewilder and astound than the very corner where Curtis had picked up the cab .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 28]: On both sides , from the level of the street to a height often measurable in hundreds of feet , nearly every building blazed with electric signs .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 9]: Many of the devices seemed to be alive .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 119]: Horses galloped , either in Roman stadium or modern polo-ground ; a girl 's skirts were fluttered by a rain-storm ; a giant 's hand , with unerring skill , bowled a ball at ten-pins in a bowling alley ; the names of theaters , of hotels , of drugs , of patent foods , of every known variety of caterer for human needs and amusements , flickered , and winked , and stared , at the passer-by from ground floor to attic -- while each and all -- horses , skirts , rain-drops , hand , ball , pins , and names -- glowed in every known shade of color from every known form of electric lamp .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 45]: The glare of this advertisers ' paradise was so overpowering that even the marvel-surfeited citizens who crowded the sidewalks would gather in dense groups at a corner , thence to watch and take in the dazzling significance of some sign new to their vision .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 76]: Curtis noticed many such assemblies before the taxi sped out of the magic area which ends at 42nd Street ; but it was all novel to him ; he could not discuss the contrast between last week 's glorification of Somebody 's Pickles and to-night 's triumph of Everybody 's Whisky , and he was almost bemused by the display , which provided such a bizarre anti-climax to the terrible drama he had just witnessed .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 41]: It was a positive relief , therefore , when the vehicle bowled swiftly into a quiet cross street , and he was vouchsafed only fleeting glimpses of broad avenues where fresh multitudes of lamps again bade defiance to the night .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 46]: In one place , an illuminated dial showed that the hour was eight o'clock , and the curiously simple fact of noting the time roused him to a perception of all that had happened since he strolled out of the dining-room of the Central Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 10]: He smiled dourly when he remembered the mislaid key .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 8]: Did it still repose in the bedroom ?
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 18]: Or had a housemaid found it , and restored it to a numbered hook in the office ?
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 20]: Had not that immaculately dressed clerk said he would find Number 605 `` a comfortable , quiet room '' ?
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 72]: Well , it might be all that , yet Curtis could hardly help dwelling on the thought that had he been put in any other cell of the human beehive called the Central Hotel it was highly probable he would not now be flying across New York on a self-imposed mission so nebulous , so ill-defined , that already his orderly brain was beginning to doubt the logic which inspired it .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 8]: Was it too late to draw back ?
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 46]: To this handy automobile city distances were negligible quantities , and he would rejoin the detectives before they could have any reason to suspect him even of carelessness in withholding from their ken the new and important fact revealed by the accidental change of overcoats .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 7]: And , yes -- by Jove !
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 60]: -- it would be assumed that _ his _ overcoat was the dead man 's , though , indeed , certain papers in the pockets would soon show that there was a blunder somewhere , because the John D. Curtis mentioned therein necessarily figured as the chief witness in the case now being worked up against three unknown malefactors .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 28]: Oddly enough , it was contemporaneous with this thought that the queer similarity of his own name to that of the unfortunate Frenchman first dawned on him .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 29]: John D. Curtis and Jean de Courtois were , as names , particularly as the names of two men of different nationalities , sufficiently alike to invite comment .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 63]: Well , that being so , there was all the more reason why the identity of poor Jean de Courtois should be established beyond doubt , and this reflection appealed so strongly that , when the cab stopped , Curtis was once more reconciled to the policy hurriedly arrived at while he was standing at the corner of Broadway and 27th Street .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 32]: He opened the door , alighted , glanced up at a rather imposing block of flats , and said to the driver : `` Is this 1000 West 59th Street ? ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 13]: Quite a bunch of people live here , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 21]: `` I take it , then , that the lady I wish to see occupies one of the flats ? ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 18]: The driver smiled broadly , for it seemed to him that the naïve statement sounded rather funny .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 15]: `` I guess that 's about the size of it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 5]: Curtis smiled , too .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 22]: This needless blurting out of confidences to a cabman was the one folly essential to a complete restoration of his wits .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 9]: `` Wait for me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 28]: `` I may be only a minute or two , and I shall want you to take me right back to the point I came from . ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 15]: The man nodded , and turned to set the time index of the taximeter .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 18]: A few steps led up to a spacious doorway , and Curtis passed through a revolving door .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 18]: Halfway along a well-lighted passage he saw an elevator sign , and found an attendant sitting there .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 10]: `` I believe that Miss Grandison lives here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 12]: `` Second floor -- Number 10 -- take you up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 5]: was the time-saving reply .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 14]: `` Yes , but I am not anxious to see Miss Grandison herself .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 11]: I would prefer to speak to some male relative . ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 43]: The attendant looked puzzled ; perhaps he was wishful to make smooth the way for a visitor who was obviously a gentleman , but the problem offered by Curtis 's request presented difficulties , and he fell back on his official instructions .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 38]: `` Sorry , but you must explain matters to the maid at Number 10 , '' he said , quite civilly , and Curtis was soon pressing an electric bell at the door of the flat itself .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 6]: A neatly dressed girl appeared .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 41]: Her out-of-doors costume suggested that she was either just going out or just returned , and Curtis , unaccustomed to the domestic problem as it exists in New York , fancied that she ranked above the level of a house-maid .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 7]: `` Is Miss Grandison in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 7]: `` I 'll inquire , sir .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 7]: What name shall I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 15]: It was a noncommittal answer , so he changed ground in the next question .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 32]: `` I would prefer not to meet Miss Grandison herself if it is in any way possible to interview a relative of hers , or a friend , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 38]: This colorless statement , intended to be reassuring , seemed to have such an alarming effect on the girl that he hastened to add : `` I am here with reference to Monsieur Jean de Courtois . ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 13]: His hearer smiled , and her manner changed from fright to friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 47]: Indeed , if he had not been so wrapped up in the highly disagreeable task which lay before him , he could hardly have failed to notice that she welcomed , rather than resented , the visit of a smart looking young man to the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 23]: `` Oh , come in , do , '' she said , glancing up at him with demure but very bright eyes .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 30]: `` Why did n't you say at once that you had been sent by Mr. de Courtois , without trying to scare me stiff by talking about relatives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 9]: He obeyed , and he closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 12]: `` I really meant what I said , '' he persisted .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 19]: `` Something has happened to prevent Monsieur de Courtois coming here this evening -- '' `` Not coming !
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 8]: Then there will be no wedding ! ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 39]: Her voice was subdued , but she put such distress , such perplexity , into her words that at any other time Curtis would have marveled at the gamut of emotion which the feminine temperament was capable of .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 37]: Still , he had to risk even a mild display of hysteria , so he went on quietly : `` You will understand now why I would rather meet some person other than Miss Grandison . ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 8]: `` But who is there to meet ?
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 4]: She is alone .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 26]: I do believe I am the only living being she knows in New York , except Mr. de Courtois ... Why ca n't he come ?
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 5]: What is keeping him ?
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 7]: Has he met with an accident ?
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 20]: ... Oh , I can see by your face that he is hurt -- or he has been kidnapped !
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 9]: Yes , that 's it , for sure !
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 15]: And that dear young lady will be trapped like a bird in a cage !
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 4]: ... Miss Hermione !
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 3]: Miss Hermione !
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 35]: Here is someone come to tell you that Mr. de Courtois has been spirited away ... Oh dear , to think that this should be the end of all our planning and contriving ! ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 49]: During this crescendo of excited and scarcely intelligible utterances the girl had first backed away from Curtis , and then turned , running to open , without knocking , a door on the right of the extreme end of a corridor which divided the suite into two sections .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 8]: Curtis did not attempt to stop her .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 18]: Whatsoever the outcome , he was committed now to an undertaking from which there was no retreat .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 35]: He half expected that the maid , whose disjointed outburst betokened , at least , that she was her mistress 's trusted confidante , would reappear from the room into which she had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 38]: But he was mistaken , doubly mistaken , since the mental picture he had formed of Hermione Beauregard Grandison was utterly falsified by the slight , elegant , girlish figure which presented itself before his astonished eyes .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 41]: Somehow , those superfine Christian names and that aristocratic surname had prepared him for a rather magnificent person , young , probably , because the dead man might be of his own age within a year , but decidedly impressive .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 49]: He had gone so far as to imagine her an actress , of the sinuous , well-rounded type , who would address him in a deep contralto , and , if and when she fainted , would sink gracefully on to a couch correctly placed for scenic effect .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 7]: The reality took his breath away .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 34]: He saw a girl , not a day older than twenty , dressed in a simple costume of brown cloth , and wearing a hat , veil , and gloves of harmonizing tints .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 43]: The veil had been hurriedly lifted above the brim of the hat , and a pair of what seemed to be intensely dark violet eyes gazed at him from a small-featured , pallid face from which every vestige of color had fled .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 7]: `` Is this thing true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 12]: she said , halting timidly within a few feet of him .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 7]: `` Perhaps Marcelle has misunderstood you .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 4]: Who sent you ?
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 10]: -- Monsieur de Courtois himself , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 30]: Her voice , so wistful , so pleading , perfect in cadence yet almost childlike in its evident anxiety to be reassured , reached uncharted depths in his soul .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 47]: At once he began to ask himself why this mere girl should be exposed to the impish trick which fate had played on her , and , in the same breath , he was conscious of a fierce anger against the ghouls who had contrived it .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 7]: `` Are you Miss Grandison ? ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 17]: he asked , rather to gain time than because of any doubt as to her personality .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 4]: And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 10]: `` My name is Curtis -- John D. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 11]: I only landed in New York three hours ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 36]: He added the explanatory sentence in order to clear the ground , as it were , for the strange and horrible story he had to tell , but its effect was curious in the extreme .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 17]: The girl 's white face blanched to that wan hue which personal fear lends to distress .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 8]: `` Where have you come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 5]: `` From Pekin . ''
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 5]: `` From Pekin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 13]: I have been traveling without pause during the past eight weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 14]: By this time he had ascertained two certain facts about Hermione Beauregard Grandison .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 35]: In the first place , she was the prettiest and most graceful creature he had ever met ; in the second , she had all the hall-marks of good breeding and high social caste .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 29]: His brain was so busy over these discoveries that he disregarded the really remarkable way in which the object of his visit had been shelved for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 35]: It might reasonably be expected that the disconsolate lady would be concerned mainly as to the fate of the missing bridegroom , but the mistress evidently shared the maid 's disquietude about Curtis himself .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 27]: And , precisely as in the case of Marcelle , Miss Grandison 's face showed relief when it became manifest that he was a complete stranger .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 34]: `` Pray forgive me for questioning you in this manner , '' she said , with a rapid reversion to a conventional air that disconcerted her hearer in a way she little imagined .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 11]: `` Will you come in here , and be seated ?
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 16]: ... Now , please tell me just why you have called , Mr. Curtis . ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 45]: She had preceded him into a prettily furnished dining-room , and the notion leaped up in his troubled mind that she was not so deeply moved by the malfortune of Monsieur Jean de Courtois as might be expected from the man 's prospective bride .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 18]: Still , he tried bravely to accommodate himself to conditions which left his brain in a whirl .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 36]: `` I had better begin by saying that your marriage can not take place -- to-night -- '' he added , flinching from the necessity of bringing that look of dismay into those charming eyes .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 22]: `` That is why I asked your maid if there was no other person whom I could take into my confidence .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 31]: You see , it is a terribly hard thing to be compelled to discuss such a matter with one so closely bound up with -- with Monsieur de Courtois . ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 8]: `` But there is no one else .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 9]: Marcelle and I live here quite alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 27]: More than ever did Curtis feel uncomfortable , but he had deliberately elected for this miserable job , and he meant to go through with it .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 13]: `` So I gathered from Mademoiselle Marcelle herself , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 43]: `` Well , then , Miss Grandison , I have no option but to inform you , with all the sympathy any man must feel for a woman in your position , that Monsieur de Courtois has met with an accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 6]: `` Oh , how terrible !
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 6]: Is he badly hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 13]: `` Yet it may be possible for the ceremony to be performed .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 83]: Monsieur de Courtois has proved himself such a true friend , he has always been so anxious to help me , that I am sure he would be glad if I brought the minister to the hospital , or to his apartments in the hotel if he has been taken there , and the marriage would be solemnized without causing him the slightest inconvenience or worry , no matter how ill he may be , so long as he is conscious . ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 21]: Curtis thought he had never before heard the English language twisted into such enigmas as these few simple words presented .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 24]: It was an outrage to credit this well-mannered and delightful girl with the cold-blooded callousness which seemed to reveal itself in every syllable .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 22]: That she was blithely unaware of this element in her excited utterances was shown by her eager face and animated attitude .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 37]: She had risen from the chair in which she had seated herself when they entered the room , and obviously expected him to lose no time in conducting her to the bedside of Jean de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 51]: `` Pray sit down again , Miss Grandison , '' said Curtis , and his voice assumed a sterner , more commanding note , though he , too , stood up , and approached nearer , lest she might collapse in a faint and fall before he could save her .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 33]: `` I fear I have blundered woefully in assuming a role for which I am ill-fitted , but I must make you realize somehow that your marriage is irrevocably -- postponed . ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 15]: A slight color tinged her cheeks ; she was actually becoming annoyed with him !
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 11]: `` I will tell you when you are seated . ''
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 4]: `` What nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 8]: One can hear as well standing . ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 5]: Nevertheless , she obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 12]: People generally did obey when Curtis spoke in that insistent manner .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 14]: Now he was quite near her , and his tone grew gentle again .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 16]: `` The accident from which Monsieur de Courtois suffered was fatal , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 30]: She looked at him , wide-eyed , alarmed , but assuredly not with the soul-sickened terror of a woman who loves when she hears that her lover is dead .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 11]: `` Do you mean that he has been killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 6]: `` Oh , poor fellow .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 24]: I have lost my only friend , and now , indeed , I am the most wretched girl in all the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 24]: Flinging her clasped arms on the table , she hid her face in them , and sobbed as though her heart would break .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 50]: Curtis placed a hand on her shoulder , and strove to calm her with such commonplace phrases as his dazed brain could dictate , but she wept bitterly , just as a child might weep if disappointed about the non-fulfillment of some object on which its heart was set .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 27]: `` It sounds horrid -- I know -- '' she murmured brokenly , `` that I should -- seem to be thinking -- only of myself .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 16]: But -- Monsieur de Courtois -- was the one man -- who could save me .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 13]: Now -- I do n't know -- what will become of me .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 5]: How cruel is fate !
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 20]: If only -- we could have been married yesterday -- perhaps this dreadful thing would not have happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 39]: Curtis , who had never been so mystified in his life , followed up those last disjointed words as a man lost in a forest might cling to a path in the certainty that it would lead somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 21]: He rejected all else , since the wild vagaries of events during the past few minutes were beyond his comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 39]: He waited , therefore , until the vehemence of her grief had somewhat subsided , and then , with another friendly pressure on her shoulder , he spoke with as much firmness as he thought the situation demanded .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 17]: `` Now , Miss Grandison , you must endeavor to regain self-control , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 38]: `` Monsieur de Courtois has been killed , and your -- your friendship for him -- no less than the interests of justice -- demand that those responsible for his death should be discovered and punished . ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 40]: At that , she raised her head , and lifted her swimming eyes to his , and Curtis saw that they were blue , not violet , and that their hue changed as the light irradiated their profound depths .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 14]: `` He met with no accident , then , but was murdered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 7]: `` And for my sake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 14]: `` I gather from what you have said that that is possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 8]: `` But what have I said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 17]: `` Well , you seemed to hint that your marriage might have prevented this crime . ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 29]: No more exasperating monosyllable can fall from a woman 's lips than that one word `` why , '' and Curtis felt its full force then and there .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 17]: `` That is what I am asking you , '' he said , a trifle brusquely .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 9]: `` But how can I tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 16]: `` I am only striving vainly to pierce the fog which seems to envelop us .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 5]: Let me begin again .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 47]: I , a mere stranger in New York , just three hours landed from the _ Lusitania _ , witnessed a murderous attack on a young man who was alighting from a cab in front of my hotel , the Central , in West 27th Street .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 36]: I saw him stabbed so seriously that he died within a couple of minutes , and his assailants made off in an automobile , the very vehicle , in fact , in which he arrived .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 28]: I managed to note its number , and I gathered , from instructions the victim himself had given , that the chauffeur 's Christian name was Anatole .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 41]: The two men who actually committed the murder -- though the chauffeur was in league with them -- seemed to me to be Czechs or Hungarians -- '' `` Ah , I thought so , '' broke in the girl .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 13]: `` And now may I ask why you did think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 9]: `` I may tell you later , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 4]: Please forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 11]: I am quite unnerved , and oh , so unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 7]: Why have you come here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 14]: `` That is due to one of those fantastic chances which occur occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 38]: In the effort to save Monsieur de Courtois , or rather to seize his slayers , because I was too far away to interfere when the blow was struck , I dropped the overcoat I was carrying .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 17]: A crowd gathered , and someone gave me a coat which I took as my own .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 55]: It was not until I had quitted the police and doctor , who arrived almost immediately , and I had gone into Broadway to avoid the clamor in the hotel , that I discovered I was wearing the dead man 's overcoat , and in one of the pockets I found a marriage license .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 4]: Here it is .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 34]: By that means I learnt your address , and I came here quickly , hoping to save you some of the agony which the appearance of a policeman or detective would have caused .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 15]: Unfortunately , I have proved but a sorry substitute for an official messenger . ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , no , Mr. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 9]: You have been most kind , most considerate .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 27]: If anyone is to blame , it is I. '' `` Will you pardon me , then , if I remind you that time is pressing ?
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 12]: Even a half-hour gained to-night by the authorities may be invaluable .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 37]: If you are able to supply any clew , the least hint of motive , the most shadowy of guesses at a personality behind this beastly crime , you will be rendering a great service . ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 11]: `` Please , please , give me time to think .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 37]: I am not heartless -- indeed I am not ... If I could do anything to save Monsieur de Courtois ' life I would make the sacrifice -- you will believe that , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 24]: ... But he is dead , you say , and I might blurt out something in my distress which would cause endless mischief .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 11]: Perhaps I have thought too much of my own troubles .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 12]: Now I must begin to endure for the sake of others .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 32]: That is the woman 's lot in life , I fear ... Have you a wife or a sister , Mr. Curtis , or is there some woman whom you love ?
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 24]: For her sake , have pity on me , and do not drag me into the horrible arena of courts and newspapers . ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 30]: Her pleading , her attitude , her pathetic gestures , gave extraordinary force to an appeal which , by contrast with her extreme agitation , was almost grotesquely inconsequent .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 46]: Curtis was at his wits ' end to find the line of reasoning calculated to convince this beautiful creature that she might , indeed , begin enduring `` for the sake of others '' by expressing her determination to give the police all possible assistance .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 25]: `` There is no urgency for a few minutes , '' was the best reply he could frame on the spur of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 11]: `` Shall I leave you alone for a little while ?
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 9]: Perhaps you would like to consult your maid ?
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 13]: Indeed , her services might meet all the requirements of the case .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 35]: The police would be the first to recognize that a woman who had lost her affianced husband under such terrible -- '' `` Ah , but that is the wretched difficulty I am in .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 10]: Poor Monsieur de Courtois was nothing to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 6]: `` Nothing to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 40]: Probably Curtis 's brain did not reel , but it assuredly felt like reeling , and it is quite certain that his eyes blazed down on the half-hysterical girl with an intensity that magnetized her into a broken excuse .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 36]: `` It is -- quite -- true , '' she stammered , with the diffidence of a child explaining some lapse which , it was hoped , might not be regarded as a real fault .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 36]: `` I never dreamed of marriage -- in the sense -- that people mean -- when they intend to live happily together ... Monsieur de Courtois was to be my husband -- only in name .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 34]: I -- I paid him for that ... I -- I gave him a thousand dollars -- and -- and -- Do n't look at me in that way or I shall scream !
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 46]: ... I have done nothing wrong ... I was trying to protect myself ... Oh , if you are a man you will want to help me , rather than push me into the living tomb which threatens to engulf me before to-morrow morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 14]: Even in their agitation , they both heard the jar of a bell .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 5]: The girl sprang upright .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 23]: There was something splendid in her courage , in the way she threw back her proud head and clenched her tiny hands .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 5]: `` Ah me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 3]: she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 9]: `` Perhaps it is already too late ! ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 22]: CHAPTER III EIGHT-THIRTY They stood in silence , listening to the footsteps of Marcelle on the parquet floor of the passage .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 15]: The outer door was opened , and a murmur of voices reached them indistinctly .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 73]: `` I have had the honor of knowing you not much longer than ten minutes , Miss Grandison , '' said Curtis , and the strong , vibrant note in his voice might well have won any woman 's confidence , `` but if you feel that you can trust me , and my help is of value , please command me , that is , if your enemies are men . ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 10]: She rewarded him with one swift look of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 18]: `` If it is my father , both you and I are powerless , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 12]: `` And the other would not dare come without him . ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 9]: A discreet tap on the door heralded Marcelle .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 31]: That sprightly young person , despite her Parisian name , was unquestionably American in every inch of her self-possessed neatness ; she smiled at Curtis while giving him a message .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 26]: `` The driver of your taxi has sent up the hall-porter to ask if you wish him to wait any longer , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 19]: Not often , even in comedy , has the mountain heaved and brought forth such a ridiculous mouse .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 15]: Curtis did actually laugh ; even his distraught companion tittered in sheer nervous reaction .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 19]: `` Please tell him to wait , and not to worry about the fare , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 42]: `` I suppose , '' he added , turning to Miss Grandison , `` the man put me down as a newcomer , and , taught by previous experience , thought it best to warn me how the register mounts . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 46]: The effort to restore their rather strained relations to a sedate level was well meant , but the girl 's downcast eyes and tremulous lips revealed a state of piteous uncertainty and confusion that was more distressing to Curtis than anything which had gone before .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 27]: Nevertheless , reminding himself that precious time was being wasted , he determined to seek a full explanation of circumstances which at present savored of Bedlam .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 31]: `` Now that the fears of the taxi-driver have been stilled , '' he said cheerfully , `` suppose you and I sit down and discuss matters like sensible people .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 28]: I am an American , Miss Grandison , and , although long an exile from my own country , I appreciate the national characteristic of plain speech .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 41]: Let me explain that I am not married , that I have no ties which prevent free action on my part , and that nothing on earth will stop me from helping a woman who pins her faith to me .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 29]: With that preamble , as the lawyers say , I purpose taking off this heavy overcoat , and listening in comfort to anything you may wish to tell .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 42]: Or , if you are afraid of being disturbed , what do you say if we go to some restaurant , where , perhaps , we may eat , and , at any rate , talk without fear of interference ? ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 44]: `` I think we had better remain here , '' said the girl sadly , though it was plain that Curtis 's offer of protection during the alarm created by the hall-porter 's errand had advanced him a long way in her esteem .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 41]: `` There are only two persons living who dare pretend to exercise control over my actions , and if they have arrived in New York this evening I have good reason to believe that I can not escape them . ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 9]: `` Are they coming here from Europe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 17]: asked Curtis quickly , for his active mind was already groping toward certain dimly defined conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 15]: `` Could they have been fellow-passengers of mine on the _ Lusitania _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 13]: `` No , they are on board the _ Switzerland _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 9]: He smiled , and discarded that fateful overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 25]: `` Then set your mind at rest , '' he said , with the nonchalance of a man who has shelved a major difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 9]: `` The _ Switzerland _ has broken down .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 6]: We passed her early to-day .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 22]: She is staggering into port with engines partly disabled and she can not possibly reach New York before to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 7]: `` Are you quite sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 5]: came the eager demand .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 38]: `` Well , there is nothing so uncertain as the sea but a young friend of mine said that those facts were signaled by wireless , and , to some extent , they governed his own movements .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 23]: I myself can assure you that the _ Switzerland _ was limping along like a lame duck at 8 A.M. to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 11]: `` Ah , thank Heaven for that small mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 4]: murmured the girl .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 35]: For a few seconds she busied herself with gloves , veil , and hat-pins , and Curtis happened to glance at the overcoat , which he had placed over the back of a chair .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 48]: To his dismay , he noticed that one of the sleeves , the left , was bespattered with blood , but he contrived to refold the garment so as to conceal this grewsome record of a tragedy before his hostess had divested herself of hat and gloves .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 71]: Then they seemed to survey each other with a new interest , for Curtis was a good figure of a man in evening dress , and Hermione Grandison became , if possible , more attractive to the male eye because of the wealth of brown hair which crowned her smooth forehead , almost hid her tiny ears , and clustered low at the back of her slender , well-shaped neck .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 17]: Where the rays of light caught the coiled tresses they had the sheen of burnished gold .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 32]: In the shadow they commingled those voluptuous tints by which the magic of Rubens has immortalized one fair woman , Isabella Brant , in every gallery of note throughout the world .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 23]: Hermione it was , now , who first broke the silence which had reigned in the room for a minute or more .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 35]: Seating herself on the opposite side of a square table , and resting her elbows thereon , she propped her pretty chin on her small , clenched fists , and gazed fearlessly at Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 14]: `` You must think me a very extraordinary person , '' she began .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 26]: `` Let that pass , '' said he , with a smile , wise in the knowledge that the present was no hour for compliments .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 35]: `` But I am , and I know it , not because I differ so greatly from other girls of my own age , but owing to the misery which has been my portion .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 18]: The one man in the world who should wish to secure my happiness has become my persecutor .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 47]: I am here to-night because I have run away from my father , and I have used every lawful means to get married -- under conditions framed by myself , of course -- in order to escape from a hateful marriage which he has planned . ''
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 14]: She hesitated , for a reflective frown was deepening on Curtis 's face .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 8]: `` Now you recognize my name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 12]: `` Have you seen anything about me in the newspapers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 8]: `` You are Lady Hermione Grandison ? ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 9]: he said , meeting her watchful eyes frankly .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 9]: `` Daughter of the Earl of Valletort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 33]: `` And about a month ago you were reported missing from some apartment in the Rue de Rivoli , on the eve of your marriage with -- with some Hungarian prince ? ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 8]: `` Yes , Count Ladislas Vassilan . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 13]: `` So you came here -- with Monsieur Jean de Courtois ? ''
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 13]: `` I brought him here , and paid him for his services .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 48]: I have no desire to minimize his friendly aid , but I was buying the security of his name as my husband , and he had given me his guarantee that , when it suited my purposes , he would help me to dissolve the marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 9]: Curtis disregarded a perceptible coldness in her tone .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 9]: He was too busy sweeping away the mists .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 7]: `` What sort of guarantee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 10]: `` His promise , his word of honor . ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 8]: `` Was he -- a gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 10]: `` Not socially , but in every other sense .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 8]: He was my music-master in Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 7]: Curtis put his next question hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 48]: He was anxious to avoid the least suspicion on the girl 's part that he might be crediting Jean de Courtois with motives which would not pass muster before a jury of cool-headed men so readily as they seemed to have satisfied an impetuous and frightened girl .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 14]: `` How did your father ascertain that you were in New York ? ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 42]: `` Oh , it seems that a certain period of residence was necessary before a marriage license could be obtained , and it was unavoidable that my name should be found out by those whom he hired to track me . ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 13]: `` But why were you not married under an assumed name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 17]: `` Monsieur de Courtois assured me that such a thing would render the marriage invalid . ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 10]: `` He was wrong , '' said Curtis dryly .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 26]: `` It subjected you to some small legal penalty , but you would be just as effectually married if you called yourself Jane Smith . ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 8]: `` I really think you are mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 10]: Monsieur de Courtois made the most exhaustive inquiries . ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 14]: `` Were you not leaving the ceremony to the latest possible hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 28]: went on Curtis , divided now between the fear of shocking her and the paramount importance of learning the truth about the curiously scrupulous Jean de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 18]: `` We were to have been married two days ago , but the license was stolen . ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 55]: `` So it is rather by accident than otherwise that Lord Valletort and Count Vassilan , who , I take it , is with your father on board the _ Switzerland _ , have not arrived in time to prevent the marriage -- that is , if they were able to prevent it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 7]: `` No , I think not .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 28]: Poor Monsieur de Courtois was here this afternoon , and he was jubilant because we had plenty of time , provided we were married this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 10]: `` Where was the ceremony to take place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 8]: `` I -- I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 12]: I left everything in the hands of Monsieur de Courtois . ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 22]: A very real and active doubt of the Frenchman 's good faith was beginning to peep up in Curtis 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 43]: Rather to account for the thoughtful lines on his forehead than for any reason connected with the license , he took that document from the table , where it had lain since he produced it , and affected to examine it judiciously .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 23]: Therefore , he was really surprised when he found an endorsement on the back which read ; -- `` Issued in duplicate .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 13]: This license is not available if the original has been used . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 12]: he said , and the monosyllable might mean much or little .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 8]: `` What have you discovered there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 21]: said the girl , rising and coming nearer , to stoop over the table and scrutinize the paper with him .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 35]: `` The original license certainly seems to have disappeared , '' said Curtis , who had suddenly become aware that the propinquity of a charming woman was one of the subtle joys of life .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 5]: `` Ah me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 14]: sighed Lady Hermione , straightening her supple form , and turning slightly aside .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 6]: There was a little pause .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 22]: Curtis , whose enunciation was usually distinguished by its ease and clearness , found some slight difficulty in resuming the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 15]: He resolved firmly that , in future , he would eschew liqueurs after champagne .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 47]: `` I hate to act the role of inquisitor , Lady Hermione , '' he said , rather huskily as to the first few words , `` but would you mind telling me why you are so opposed to Count Ladislas Vassilan as a husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 46]: `` First , because I do not want to marry any man ; secondly , because Count Vassilan is a vile person , both in appearance and repute ; and thirdly , because my father is only urging this match to serve his own ends .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 46]: Our unhappy history is so widely known that there is no harm in telling you that my mother and he were separated during many years , and when mamma died three years ago she left all her money to me , absolutely under my control .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 47]: I was young , only seventeen , but I managed to retain it , though goodness only knows how , and this horrid Hungarian prince wants it -- to help him to regain a throne , he says -- but I do n't believe him . ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 25]: `` You could not be forced into matrimony , '' said Curtis , with a slow gravity that was lost on his dejected hearer .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 22]: `` You can not have lived in France , or you would not say that , '' was the bitter answer .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 10]: `` Everyone , everything , was opposed to me .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 10]: I was a minor , and one against many .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 63]: The laws seemed to conspire with my relatives to force me into the power of a beast ... Yes , it sounds horrid on my lips , but the man is really a beast , '' and she stamped an emphatic foot on the floor ; Curtis could see the white circles over the tiny knuckles as her hands clenched in protest .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 8]: They were such pretty hands , too .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 29]: He had often smiled at the notion of a man kissing a woman 's hand , but it did not strike him now as a specially foolish act .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 10]: `` Let us forget him , '' he agreed .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 8]: `` But how can I forget him ?
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 6]: He will be here to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 15]: Once my father and he have found me , what am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 5]: Die , I suppose !
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 33]: ... I would rather die than marry Count Vassilan , and again I would rather die than figure in a vulgar brawl , such as the newspapers would take a delight in .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 32]: My father is well aware of that , and will play on my weakness ... B-but -- I may -- be able -- to defeat them -- in another way . ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 4]: Curtis stood up .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 16]: The sound of her grief maddened him , and he threw prudence to the winds .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 37]: `` The first reason you gave was the most convincing one , so far as you personally are concerned , Lady Hermione , '' he said , making the effort of his life to speak calmly .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 13]: `` You said you did not want to marry any man . ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 7]: `` Y-yes , it is true .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 18]: I d-don ` t. '' `` Still , there is only one way out of your trouble .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 8]: You must marry me -- to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 20]: The girl whirled round on him ; her eyes were glistening with tears , but her face was radiant .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 8]: `` Do you really mean that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 16]: `` Then never let anyone tell me that the age of chivalry has passed . ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 19]: `` I fancy it has just begun , '' he said , though the jest nearly choked him .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 24]: `` But why should you do this kind and gracious thing for a girl you have been acquainted with only a brief half-hour ?
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 39]: You see , I understand that you are a gentleman -- I realize that , although I have plenty of money , I can not offer to recompense you as I did that poor Jean de Courtois . ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 8]: `` No , '' he agreed grimly .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 11]: `` Do n't you grasp what this one-sided bargain implies ?
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 17]: You are merely to pose as my husband until Count Vassilan leaves me in peace ? ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 11]: `` And then we are to obtain a divorce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 18]: `` You are , not I. '' `` Is n't that a distinction without a difference ? ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 3]: `` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 27]: The fact remains that I shall agree to all your terms save one -- you , of course , can divorce me at your own pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 12]: The procedure is simple in some States of the Union . ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 9]: For no obvious reason , Lady Hermione blushed .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 20]: For an instant , indeed , she was somewhat disconcerted , and the vivacity fled from her mobile face .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 25]: `` Perhaps , Mr. Curtis , I have no right to let you make this sacrifice , '' she said , a trifle coldly .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 14]: `` It would be different if I could repay you in some way .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 37]: Surely , although you may be a wealthy man , there will be expenses -- you will , at least , lose a good deal of time , which you could occupy to better purpose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 15]: `` I have given myself twelve months ' respite from railway construction in China .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 21]: I really do n't see how I could pass a part of my holiday better than as your husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 6]: `` In idle make-believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 20]: `` Every decent man has the heart of a child , and make-believe is reality to some children . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 23]: `` But , even though in my need I take you at your word , how can a marriage become possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 6]: `` Here is the license .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 12]: For the purposes of the ceremony I become Jean de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 30]: By singular chance , the change of name is not such a wrench as it might be if I did n't happen to be called John D. Curtis . ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 4]: Still she hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 26]: Somehow , becoming Mrs. John D. Curtis impressed her as a far more serious undertaking than purchasing the right to pose as Madame de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 15]: `` We do n't even know where to get married , '' she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 19]: `` Given a license and a comparatively small sum of money , New York abounds with facilities . ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 18]: `` Are you sure the ceremony will be legal if you appear under a false name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 5]: `` Quite positive . ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 12]: `` Can you be punished if it is found out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 8]: `` I 'll run the risk . ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 36]: After a fateful pause , which would have been considerably curtailed had Lady Hermione Grandison been vouchsafed the least premonition of events in which the night was still rich , she held out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 20]: `` I can only thank you from the depths of my heart , Mr. Curtis , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 15]: `` I must trust someone , and I do trust you most implicitly . ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 15]: `` You will never regret it , Lady Hermione , '' he said reverently .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 41]: He wondered whether or not this was an occasion on which hand-kissing was permissible , but contented himself with returning the friendly pressure of the girl 's fingers -- retaining them , in fact , for a second or two .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 22]: `` I have your word of honor that you will regard the ceremony as a formal compact between us two ? ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 22]: she murmured , unaccountably shy , and seemingly half-afraid that he meant to clasp her in his arms then and there .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 12]: `` You have , '' he said , relinquishing her hand .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 35]: Perhaps , at that instant , Puck sighed , and wondered what would have happened had this husband only in name strained to his heart the bride whom he had vowed not to embrace .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 8]: But Curtis did nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 15]: His tone became intensely practical and businesslike , and he glanced at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 10]: `` It is half-past eight , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 18]: `` How soon will you be ready to come with me and hunt up a minister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 8]: `` Now -- I am ready now .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 17]: Marcelle and I were waiting for -- for that unhappy Monsieur de Courtois when you arrived .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 37]: It sounds rather dreadful , Mr. Curtis , to talk of marriage , even as a mere means of cheating the law , at a moment when a man is already lying dead for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 22]: Please do n't consider me , but draw back , if you want to , before it is too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 16]: `` My grandfather commanded the Fifth Cavalry during the Civil War , Lady Hermione . ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 12]: `` Pray , how does that interesting fact affect us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 20]: `` It is well-known that the Fifth never retreat , and the habit has become a family tradition . ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 27]: He pocketed the license , and picked up the overcoat , meaning to put it on in the hall while her ladyship was rearranging her hat .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 11]: But Marcelle was waiting there , hatted , and gloved .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 7]: `` Have you fixed things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 4]: she whispered breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 8]: `` We have , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 4]: `` Goodness me !
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 5]: But I guessed it .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 9]: Nobody can resist her , can they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 16]: `` I did n't try , '' said Curtis , wriggling into the coat sideways .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 6]: `` Poor _ dear _ .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 6]: She has had a time .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 14]: What a piece of luck I met her the day she landed . ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 18]: Curtis had no opportunity to inquire just what Marcelle meant , for Lady Hermione had joined them .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 25]: Sedulously keeping that tell-tale sleeve out of sight , Curtis took the lead , and opened the door , which Marcelle closed and locked .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 28]: While they were waiting for the elevator , Curtis fathomed Marcelle 's stock of information as to the addresses of neighboring ministers of the Protestant Episcopal Church .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 4]: It was nil .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 30]: He appealed to the attendant when the elevator came up , but that worthy thoughtfully tickled his scalp under his cap , and suggested a consultation with the taxi-driver .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 39]: Indeed , to further the quest , he went with them to the door , and , while Lady Hermione and Marcelle seated themselves in the cab , the three men discussed the religious problem on the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 19]: `` Ministers do n't use taxis much in N ' York , sir , '' commented the driver .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 43]: `` Fact is , they mostly ca n't afford 'em , but I do happen to know where one old gentleman lives , an ' he 's sure to be home , because he 's crippled something cruel with the rheumatiz . ''
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 6]: `` Is it far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 3]: demanded Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 13]: `` Three blocks away , in 56th Street , near Seventh Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 11]: Lives next door to the church , he does . ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 26]: `` Take us there , '' and Curtis entered the vehicle , which whirled out of sight in the peculiarly downright fashion of the automobile .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 15]: The elevator man looked after it , and tickled another section of his scalp .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 19]: `` I 'd a notion she was going to marry that Frenchman , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 28]: `` Of course , it 's her business , an ' not mine , but of the two I 'd take a chance with this new fellar .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 28]: An ' it 's odd , too , that they should n't know where to go , unless they mean to pick up Froggy on the road .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 25]: Well , wimmen is queer creetures , they are , sure , an ' the English ones are just as queer as the Americans .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 40]: Not that Miss Grandison ai n't a peach wherever she comes from , an ' I hope she 'll be happy , night an ' day till the time comes when she do n't care if it snows . ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 32]: He glanced up at the sky , rolled a cigarette , and , before returning indoors , sniffed a keen wind which was rustling the last crisp leaves in Central Park .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 14]: The street was quiet , and no one was stirring in the mansion .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 29]: `` I 'm not likely to be wanted for another minnit or two , '' he said , `` so I 'll just give the furnace a shake-out .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 12]: Unless I 'm mistaken , there 's a frost coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 59]: Had he prophesied a hurricane he would not have been far wrong , but it was entirely in keeping with the other remarkable developments of a night already noteworthy for its strange happenings that the elevator attendant at No. 1000 59th Street should have chosen the next few minutes to attend to the steam-heating arrangements in the basement .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 57]: There is little to be gained , however , from speculation as to the probable outcome of conditions which did not obtain , and the trivial space of time which was demanded for the shaking-out and re-coaling of a furnace was largely responsible for John D. Curtis and Hermione Beauregard Grandison being made man and wife .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 50]: Curiously enough , the tying of this particular knot was facilitated by the fact that the clergyman was hale mentally but decrepit physically , and , as might be expected , resented the conclusion , long ago arrived at by his friends , that he was unfitted for work .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 51]: He burgeoned with delight when a servant announced that two young people wanting to get married were waiting in the vestibule ; he hobbled out of the library , where he was poring over an essay on the Sixtine text of the Septuagint , and ushered them into a parlor .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 45]: The room was not well-lighted , because of some defect in the electric installation , but the old gentleman -- `` Rev. Thomas J. Hughes '' was the legend on the door-plate -- bustled about in the liveliest way , and talked most cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 27]: `` Ah , young folk -- as usual , leaving things to the last moment , and then in a desperate hurry , '' he chirped .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 7]: `` Got the license -- yes ?
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 6]: Complied with all the formalities ?
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 6]: Of course , of course .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 5]: Where 's the ring ?
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 10]: You 've _ not _ forgotten the ring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 35]: Curtis and Hermione looked at each other in blank dismay ; even Marcelle 's aplomb yielded under this unforeseen strain , and her agitation showed itself in a gasping murmur : `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 7]: What shall we do now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 8]: Mr. Hughes positively chortled over their discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 11]: He limped to a secretaire , and opened a drawer .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 18]: `` See what it is to have a long experience in these affairs , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 16]: `` Do you fancy you are the first couple who failed to provide a ring ?
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 3]: Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 48]: When I was quite a boy in the cloth I learnt the necessity of keeping rings in stock , so a jeweler friend of mind replenishes my store , and , when I sell one , I apply a small profit to a favorite charity of mine .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 24]: The wearing of a wedding ring has no legal significance , but it is a fine old custom , and should be preserved .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 21]: Among the Romans the ring was a pledge , _ pignus _ , that the betrothal contract would be fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 42]: Pliny tells us that the ring , or circle , was of iron , but the ladies speedily determined that it should be of gold , and the Church went a step farther in recognizing it as a symbol of matrimony .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 80]: Hence , perhaps , the Episcopal ring , and even the Ring of the Fisherman itself , though some authorities hold that signets -- Ah , yes , '' for Curtis had intimated politely that the hour was growing late , `` if the lady will say which of these rings fits ; they are fifteen dollars each -- cheaper , I believe , than you can buy them in Fifth Avenue ... Ah , _ that _ one ?
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 10]: Now , as to the form of service ? ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 10]: `` The full marriage rite , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 10]: `` Precisely , just what I would have suggested .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 7]: I adhere to the time-honored formula .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 48]: Now , let me examine the license -- my eyes fail me a little , but I take the utmost pains to be accurate , because accuracy is of the greatest importance ... Yes , yes , State of New York -- what are the names ? ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 13]: `` John D. Curtis and Hermione Beauregard Grandison , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 25]: His tone was so calm and self-confident that even the prospective bride was deaf for a moment to the vital significance of the words .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 14]: Then she whispered tremulously : `` Are you not making some mistake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 14]: `` No , '' he replied , looking her straight in the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 21]: The minister , whose ears partook of the defects in his other faculties , caught the word `` mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 35]: `` This is no place for mistakes , my dear young lady , '' he said , `` A nice young couple like you should only require to be married once in your lives .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 39]: Take my advice , and stick to one another in sunshine and in storm , and you shall be blessed even unto the fourth generation ... Now , all is in order ... Is this your witness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 7]: and he nodded affably toward Marcelle .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 7]: `` Shall we have one other ?
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 19]: William Jenkins , my factotum , has been privileged to assist on many such occasions ... Wil-li-am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 24]: He raised his voice , and a wizened little man appeared suddenly , having evidently waited outside the door until he was summoned .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 79]: Then , with due ritual , John Delancy Curtis and Hermione Beauregard Grandison were joined in the bonds of wedlock , and , by the time Mr. Hughes had completed the ceremony , he had pronounced their names so often , and was so accustomed to their form and sound , that when he filled in the certificate annexed to the license , `` John D. Curtis '' appeared therein in place of `` Jean de Courtois . ''
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 15]: Hermione was in a pitiable state of suppressed excitement before the ordeal was concluded .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 28]: The solemnity and impressiveness of the vows she was taking disturbed the serenity with which she had schooled herself to regard the marriage as `` make-believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 8]: She was frightened at her own daring .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 29]: A dread that the tie she was so lightly assuming might be harder to undo than she had contemplated was fluttering her heart and almost paralyzing her limbs .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 36]: But Curtis was unemotional as an icicle ; or , at any rate , he looked it , which was all that the half-hysterical girl by his side could ascertain by an occasional timid glance .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 48]: The fact lent her a sort of courage to persevere to the end , and she signed her maiden name for the last time with a numb confidence in the man whom she had , so to speak , bargained for as a husband in an emergency .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 21]: Curtis did not fail to note that the aged clergyman 's handwriting was crabbed and palsied as his bent frame .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 57]: None could tell , for certain , whether he wrote `` Jean '' or `` John , '' `` Courtois '' or `` Curtis , '' though , indeed , the balance of probability inclined to the latter of the two names , Christian and surname , since those were indubitably what he meant to write .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 23]: Then , having stated his fee , and been paid for the ring , he handed Hermione a copy of the certificate .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 15]: `` Treasure that during all your days , Mrs. Curtis , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 13]: `` May it be a charter of lasting happiness and content ! ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 3]: Mrs. Curtis !
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 3]: Another shock !
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 13]: Hermione felt that she would scream if there were many more such .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 20]: And the pressure of the little gold ring on the third finger of her left hand was becoming intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 38]: Iron , it used to be , said the minister , and a band of iron it seemed to have become since this man whom she had taken , so completely on trust had placed it there .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 31]: On the way out , Curtis tipped Jenkins , tipped him so lavishly that a queer little voice squeaked from a queer little face : `` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 19]: Fair weather to both you and your wife , and a safe berth when you drop anchor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 22]: So Jenkins had been a sailor , for none but a shell-back would put his good wishes in such nautical lingo .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 25]: `` I have just finished one long voyage , but seem to have begun another , '' said Curtis to his `` wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 21]: He accompanied the words with a laugh , and was really talking for the sake of breaking an awkward silence .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 32]: They were descending a few steps from the door , and he noticed that a private automobile was speeding down the street from the same direction as the taxi had taken .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 30]: It swung close to the curb , and was pulled up barely a yard short of the waiting cab , whose engine the driver was starting with the crank .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 13]: A shout came from the interior , and a man leaped out .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 16]: The street was rather dark in that part , but Hermione recognized the stranger instantly .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 5]: `` Count Vassilan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 15]: she cried , and the fear in her voice thrilled Curtis to the core .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 35]: Almost as quickly , the man now running along the sidewalk knew that a long chase had ended , or he fancied that it had ended , which is not always the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 8]: `` Here we are , Valletort ! ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 7]: `` Got 'em , by -- !
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 5]: You see after Hermione !
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 11]: I 'll attend to this d -- d Frenchman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 28]: Curtis gently disengaged the clasp of a tiny hand on his arm , a clasp which was eloquent of a woman 's sore need and complete trust .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 25]: He stepped forward to meet the Count , a stoutly built , heavy man , who had reckoned on closing with an undersized Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 8]: There was no time to rectify mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 15]: Curtis met his rival 's onset with a beautiful half-arm jab on the nose .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 54]: Scientifically , it was perfect , since the blow was delivered at the back of the Count 's head with complete disregard of intervening tissues , and its recipient went down like one of those pins which succumbed so regularly to the ball bowled by a colossal fist in the Broadway electric sign .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 20]: The only difference was that the pin fell noiselessly , whereas Count Vassilan roared like a bull in anguish .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 60]: In the next instant Curtis , who , for a mild-mannered person , appeared to possess a singularly close acquaintance with the ethics of a street row , sprang at the automobile , pushed back a man who was getting out , slammed the door , seized the speed levers , and bent them hopelessly with a violent tug .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 37]: A swearing chauffeur fumbled in the seat , but was in no real hurry to alight , because he had noted the Count 's _ débâcle _ , and Curtis ran to the two cowering women .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 6]: `` In with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 22]: he said cheerily , adding , with a grin at the driver : `` Fifty for you if we win clear .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 7]: Now , be a sport ! ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 13]: Of course , the driver of a taxi would be a sport .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 32]: In five minutes he pulled up somewhere in Madison Avenue , and , leaning back and twisting his neck , bawled : `` Where to _ now _ , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 100]: CHAPTER IV AN INTERLUDE The appearance on the scene of the Earl of Valletort and Count Ladislas Vassilan at a moment which , though undeniably critical , might be described as either opportune or inopportune -- the choice of an adjective depending solely on the varying points of view of the one who gave and the one who received that powerful thump on the nose -- was due to no feat of skill on the part of the engine-room staff of the _ Switzerland _ , but to a judicious combination of wireless telegraphy , money , and influence .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 43]: When it became evident , very early in the morning , that the vessel might , with luck , crawl up to the quarantine station about midnight , urgent messages were sent to two consulates and the Port Authorities of New York .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 41]: In the result , a fast steam-yacht drew up alongside the vessel when she took the pilot on board , and the two magnates and their baggage were transferred from the disabled liner to the deck of the trim yacht .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 24]: She made praiseworthy efforts to reach a quay and a batch of Customs officers before eight o'clock , but failed by five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 43]: Consequently , some slight delay was experienced , and , with the best of good will on the part of the officials , the two fuming passengers could not fling themselves into a waiting automobile until nearly twenty minutes past the hour .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 11]: Then , however , they made up for lost time .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 33]: Intrusting their belongings to a porter and a taxi , with instructions to proceed to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , they bade the chauffeur travel at top speed to No. 1000 59th Street .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 65]: Many times were they sworn at en route by endangered pedestrians and enraged drivers of horsed vehicles ; the growing torrent of ill wishes thus engendered may have exercised some unrecognized form of telepathy at No. 1000 , because a regulating valve in the steam-heat apparatus , which had never proved intractable before , suddenly took it into its metallic head to go wrong .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 28]: Thus , the elevator man was not aware of a good deal of ringing of electric bells and hammering on the locked door of flat Number 10 .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 51]: Ultimately , the valve resumed its normal functions , for no cause that a hot and oily human being could perceive other than the occasional `` cussedness '' which inanimate objects can be capable of ; while surveying it wrathfully , he awoke to the racket in the upper regions .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 62]: Behold him , then , angry and perspiring , vowing by all his gods that he had other duties to perform than eternally watching the comings and goings of the mansion 's occupants ; being a free-born American of Irish ancestry , name of Rafferty , he would certainly have bandied contumely with Count Ladislas Vassilan had not the Earl intervened .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 31]: The Hungarian had addressed Rafferty as though he were a dog : the Englishman , more certain of his social predominance , treated him as a person endowed with reason .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 44]: `` Now , listen to me , my good man , '' he said , calmly but emphatically , `` I am the Earl of Valletort , and the lady you know as Miss Grandison is the Lady Hermione Grandison , my daughter .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 52]: She has come to New York in order to marry a wretched little French adventurer named Jean de Courtois , and it is absolutely essential , for her own welfare , not to mention other considerations , that the wedding , which is to take place to-night , shall be prevented .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 31]: Two European consuls and several important men in your own city have helped me to land this evening from a vessel which will not disembark her passengers till the morning .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 55]: Therefore , it is fairly obvious that you run several sorts of risk by refusing to help me in finding my daughter , and I can hardly believe that you know nothing about her movements ... Come , my man , do n't be both a fool and a knave , but speak ! ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 18]: Rafferty , who had calmed down during this impressive harangue , took thought , and did speak .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 26]: `` If yer friend had said half as much , my lord , I 'd have made him wise straight away , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 32]: `` Miss Grandison went off at 8.30 in a taxi with her maid , Marcelle Leroux , and a strange gentleman who certainly was n't Mr. de Courtois , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 62]: They wanted to find out where a clergyman lived , an ' I could n't tell them -- not about the Protestant Episcopal , I mean , my lord -- but the driver of the taxi remembered that there was a minister of that persuasion living in 56th Street , near 7th Avenue , an ' next door to a church .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 34]: So they made a bee-line that-a-way , my lord , an ' I went to see to the furnace , an ' that 's all there is to it , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 11]: `` You say the man was not de Courtois ? ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 5]: queried the Earl impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 30]: `` I 'm sure he was n't the man who has passed under that name hereabouts nearly every day for a month , my lord , '' said Rafferty .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 45]: `` Oh , some fellow of his own kidney he has hired to assist him , '' put in Vassilan , who held fast to that theory , in part , even after he had been painfully disillusioned as to other parts of it .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 17]: `` Come quickly now , you , and tell our chauffeur where to take us . ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 56]: If Rafferty had dared , he would have given the chauffeur directions likely to lead to further bickering , but the presence of the Earl restrained him , for Valletort , though thin and hawk-nosed , was an aristocrat in every inch , whereas Count Ladislas Vassilan wore the stage aspect of a successful pork-butcher .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 26]: So he explained matters to the chauffeur , yet smiled grimly when the automobile wheeled away almost in the very tracks of Curtis 's taxi .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 12]: `` Who sez there 's no such thing as luck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 3]: he chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 34]: `` That valve knew what it was about when it stuck , an ' my name ai n't what it is if that wedding is n't over and done with by this time .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 14]: An ' I gev him ` my lord ' for it , too !
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 16]: Played the high-tone society act for all it was worth , eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 32]: The next scene in the drama began for the Hungarian when he sat upon the sidewalk in 56th Street , and tried to pacify certain outraged blood-vessels in the nasal region .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 34]: Of course , the curtain had been up some time , but , so far as he was concerned , the incidents which followed his precipitate descent from the automobile were merely catastrophic .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 52]: He had seen a vivid , violet-colored star close to his eyes , had felt a crushing blow , had heard his own voice vaguely ; and then he awoke to a singular sense of personal dis-ease , and to the fact that the noble Earl had nearly lost his temper .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 15]: `` It was entirely your fault , Vassilan , '' his lordship was saying .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 12]: `` You gain nothing but lose everything by your bullying tactics .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 12]: Dash it all , the fellow downed you like a prize-fighter .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 4]: Who was he ?
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 16]: Not Jean de Courtois , I 'll swear , so where has de Courtois gone ?
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 6]: Ca n't you stand up ?
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 12]: It 's damn silly to sit there , nursing your nose .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 7]: Our motor-car is out of action .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 15]: We had better interview this clergyman , and learn exactly what has happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 3]: Vassilan rose .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 19]: He was neither a coward nor a weakling , but he felt sore in mind as in body .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 9]: `` What 's wrog with the car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 10]: `` Ad cad you led me ad hadkerchief ? ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 23]: `` That rascal who was with Hermione nearly pulled the gear levers out by the roots , '' said the Earl testily .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 20]: `` He pushed me back into the limousine -- with some degree of force , too , confound him !
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 6]: Who can he be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 40]: `` Suppose we idquire , '' growled Vassilan , and , mopping his nose with the Earl 's handkerchief , he tugged viciously at the old-fashioned bell-pull which served the needs of visitors to the Rev. Thomas J. Hughes .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 35]: The maid-servant who took the names of the two men was surprised , and showed it , but her democratic respect for titles yielded to suspicion when she observed Count Vassilan 's villainous guise .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 4]: `` Wil-li-am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 29]: she cried , and , when the ex-sailor appeared from the depths , she asked him to `` look after the gentlemen '' while she summoned Mr. Hughes .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 20]: `` Cad you take me somewhere , ad supply me with a towel ad pledty of cold water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 9]: said the Hungarian , addressing the wizened one .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 50]: Now , Jenkins was verger and pew-opener in the church as well as trusted assistant to the aged minister , but the ways and language of the fo ` c 's ' l came back to him with irresistible force when he gazed on the Hungarian 's damaged organ .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 20]: `` Lord love a duck , you 've had it handed to you all right , '' he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 7]: `` How did you get it ?
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 15]: Did you foul a lamp-post , or bump a rock , or what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 17]: `` It is edough that I have met with ad accided , '' snarled the Count .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 12]: `` Cad ' t you see that I wadt some water ?
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 10]: Is there do place where I cad wash ? ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 14]: `` What you reelly want is a tap , '' said Jenkins sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 41]: `` An ' I should n't be surprised if a slab of raw beefsteak across yer lamps would n't be a bully good notion , too , or you 'll have a lovely pair of mice in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 20]: Then , hearing Mr. Hughes 's voice from the library , he suddenly recollected the habits of later years .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 18]: `` Come with me , sir , '' he said , leading the way to the basement .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 10]: `` I 'll do my best for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 24]: Perhaps it was fortunate for the success of his mission that the Earl of Valletort was left free to deal with the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 27]: The Count 's hectoring methods would certainly have stiffened the worthy old gentleman 's back , whereas he yielded readily to the Earl 's skillful handling .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 21]: He was much pained at hearing that a peer 's daughter should have fallen into the hands of an adventurer .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 4]: `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 4]: Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 3]: he wheezed .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 6]: `` This is very sad .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 11]: The man looked quite a gentleman , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 11]: And he had not the least semblance to a foreigner .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 19]: His name , too -- John D. Curtis -- is your lordship really certain of the facts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 59]: Now , `` John '' and `` Jean '' are sufficiently alike in sound to pass muster with the average man , who also connotes no difference between `` D '' and `` de , '' but the Earl was moved to say quickly : `` Perhaps you are not accustomed to French names , Mr. Hughes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 7]: `` No , I admit it .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 22]: But , here is an unimpeachable witness , '' and the minister produced the license from a drawer in the writing-desk .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 16]: Lord Valletort glanced at it , and a peculiarly unpleasant scowl convulsed his aristocratic features .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 41]: Hitherto , a stranger might have believed that Hermione 's unfavorable picture of her father had been tinged by a high-spirited girl 's hatred of the marriage which he was forcing upon her ; but that fleeting expression spoke volumes .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 18]: If Count Vassilan was of the bovine order , the Earl of Valletort savored of the tiger .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 51]: He contrived to smile , however , and the effort to figure wholly as a disconsolate parent cost him far more than he dreamed , since he examined neither the actual certificate nor the register , though both would have been submitted to his scrutiny by the bewildered Mr. Hughes .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 8]: `` Thank you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 7]: `` I fully appreciate the position .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 14]: The scoundrel has learnt how to give an English sound to his name .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 6]: Probably my daughter taught him .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 28]: Hard though it is for a father to say such a thing , she is the real brain behind this sordid story of intrigue and wrong-doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 5]: gasped Mr. Hughes again .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 12]: He felt that he must , indeed , be growing old .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 60]: He had married many hundreds of couples during his ministerial career , and had , in many instances , compared the subsequent lives of his matrimonial clients with the impressions formed during the ceremony , yet never had he been so gravely at fault as in his summing-up of the characteristics of John D. Curtis and Hermione Beauregard Grandison .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 26]: Vassilan emerged from the kitchen , dripping but less gory , and the two visitors disappeared , whereupon Mr. Hughes confided his mystification to Jenkins .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 7]: But Wil-li-am shook his cadaverous head .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 19]: `` Mebbe the Earl was right , an ' mebbe he was wrong , '' he said decisively .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 55]: `` I did n't size up the Earl , so I let it go at that , but I did see the other guy -- beg pardon , sir , I mean the other gentleman -- an ' he 'll be lucky if he gets to bed to-night without being clubbed by a policeman .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 31]: Someone has been at him already -- hard at him -- an ' I 'm not surprised , for his langwidge reminded me of my best days at sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 4]: `` William ! ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 5]: `` What , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 11]: Oh , I meant my young days , of course .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 36]: Now , I wonder -- '' It had just occurred to Jenkins that Mr. Curtis and his bride could hardly have got clear away from 56th Street before the Earl and his companion turned up .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 4]: `` Gee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 3]: he cackled .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 14]: `` I wish I had n't closed the door so damn quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 12]: Mr. Hughes raised hands of horrified protest , and Jenkins wilted .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 9]: `` Sorry , sir , '' he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 18]: `` I must have got a bit wound up when I saw the foreign gentleman 's nose .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 45]: When I went a-whalin ' on the _ Star of the Sea _ we had a first mate who could man-handle anybody , but even he would have had to use a belayin ' pin to stamp his trade-mark in _ that _ shape .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 17]: Now , the question is -- _ could _ it have been this here Mr. Curtis ?
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 16]: It reely is a pity I was so -- so spry on the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 50]: Outside , the chauffeur had announced that he had straightened the levers sufficiently to render them serviceable , and he was directed to make for the Central Hotel , 27th Street , but he had not reached Broadway before the Earl bade him return to Mr. Hughes 's residence .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 64]: What had happened was this -- Lord Valletort 's recollection of the physique and manner of Jean de Courtois fitted in so ill with the knock-down blow delivered to a portly individual like Ladislas Vassilan that he began to compare the remarks of the elevator man at 1000 59th Street with the confusion in the clergyman 's mind on the question of names .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 48]: Then , though the light had been dim , and his mind was given more to the recognition of his daughter than of the person accompanying her , he was conscious of a growing conviction that the French music-master was a being of an altogether different species .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 39]: Vassilan , too , having regained some degree of self-control , confirmed him in the belief that there must be some error in their reckoning , and agreed that they might save time by interviewing Mr. Hughes again .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 36]: But when the mild eyes of the minister rested on the Count 's truculent visage , and noted his water-soaked and blood-stained clothing , there was a distinct drying up in the fount of information .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 36]: `` No , '' he said stiffly , in reply to the Earl 's request that the marriage license should be produced again , `` I regret that I can not reopen that matter to-night .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 18]: To-morrow , if you have any cause for complaint , you should consult the proper authorities . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 49]: `` But you must allow me to emphasize the fact that the license is made out for the marriage of a man with a French name , whereas admittedly you have married my daughter to a man with an English or American name , '' said the Earl .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 9]: `` I express no opinion on the point .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 12]: Your lordship may be assuming facts which are not facts . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 13]: `` I am making a statement which can be verified quite easily .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 49]: The name I saw on the license was that of Jean de Courtois , an undersized Frenchman whom I know by sight , whereas my unfortunate friend is a living witness to the presence here of a man who must be of powerful build and exceptional strength . ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 27]: Mr. Hughes surveyed Vassilan 's battered face again , and a doubt , born of a vague memory , began to intrude into his own mind .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 10]: Moreover , he was an eminently reasonable old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 9]: `` Ah , yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 144]: `` My man , Jenkins , said something about a first mate and a belaying pin , whatever that may be -- I fancy it is an instrument connected with the flaying of whales -- and the bridegroom could certainly not be described as ` an undersized Frenchman ' by anyone who paid due regard to the truth ... Well , the whole proceeding is highly irregular , but the circumstances are quite exceptional , so -- '' In a word , the Earl and Count Vassilan were soon gorged with astonished wrath , for , no matter what discrepancies might exist between license and certificate , there could be no dispute as to the bold signature `` John D. Curtis '' in the register , while Hermione 's handwriting compelled Lord Valletort to believe that he was not the victim of hallucination .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 31]: It is easy to see , therefore , how the chase after John D. Curtis became hot thenceforth , but cooled off perceptibly on the trail of Jean de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 51]: The hunters , of course , credited Hermione with a talent for craft and duplicity which she certainly did not possess ; being rogues , or of the essence of rogues , they suspected her of roguery , and , in so doing , dug a deep pit for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 38]: On arriving at the Central Hotel they were plunged into a denser fog than ever , and by means so ludicrously simple that even a budding dramatist would hesitate to avail himself of such a crude device .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 18]: The police had searched the dead man 's clothing without finding any positive clew to his name .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 84]: His linen was marked H. R. H. , and certain laundry marks might serve to establish his identity after long and patient inquiry , but the detective who had charge of the case felt that it was becoming unusually complex when the victim 's overcoat was produced and the pockets were found to contain letters , a _ Lusitania _ wine bill , and a Marconigram -- all pointing to the clear fact that the owner of the coat was John D. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 51]: The detective , Steingall by name , was one of the shrewdest men in the New York police , and his extraordinary faculty of observing minute facts which had escaped others while investigating a crime had earned him the repute of being `` the man with a microscopic eye . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 12]: But he owned to being mystified by this juggling with names .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 46]: `` Why , '' he said to the police captain of the precinct , `` this fellow Curtis is the man who witnessed the murder , and who will be our most reliable witness if we lay hands on the scoundrels who committed it . ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 15]: `` He _ said _ his name was Curtis , '' commented the other .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 15]: The implied doubt seemed to be justified , but Steingall stroked his chin reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 8]: `` These papers bear out his story .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 18]: Look at the dates on the telegram and the bill , and the postmarks on the letters .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 17]: Can he , by some queer chance , have changed overcoats with the dead man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 11]: `` A most unlikely thing , I should say . ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 9]: `` Something of the sort must have happened .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 16]: Anyhow , let us get hold of him , and sift this matter thoroughly . ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 39]: An ambulance came just then , to take the body to the mortuary , and , when it had departed , the two men quitted the traffic bureau where they had been talking , and entered the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 9]: Here , excitement was still at fever heat .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 31]: The press had heard of the murder , and a number of reporters were interviewing everybody in sight , while photographers were adding to the confusion by taking flash-light pictures .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 10]: The super-clerk was already showing tokens of the strain .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 15]: He glared wildly at Steingall when the latter asked if Mr. Curtis was in .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 28]: `` You 're the hundred and first man to whom I have answered ` No ' in the last quarter of an hour , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 16]: `` The first hundred did n't count , anyway , '' was the dry response .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 14]: `` Pull yourself together , and read that card slowly and collectedly . ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 29]: `` Well , '' he went on , seeing that the clerk had apparently mastered the copper-plate script , `` you see I am not here for amusement .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 16]: Now , about Curtis , are you sure he is not in his room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 24]: `` His key has not been given up , but I have sent to 605 , and we ca n't get in . ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 6]: `` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 6]: Is the door locked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 10]: `` We can open every lock in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 5]: It is bolted . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 6]: `` Have you knocked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 14]: `` We 've done everything , short of breaking open the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 11]: Steingall looked perplexed , but the police captain was confident .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 30]: `` He has buncoed us , for sure , '' he said with a smile , though the smile boded evil for John D. Curtis at their next meeting .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 11]: `` Did you notice him particularly when he registered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 8]: demanded the detective , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 8]: Came to-night by the _ Lusitania _ .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 6]: Here is his signature . ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 25]: The three men gazed at the register , and Steingall produced a card , on which Curtis had written the name of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 5]: `` Same handwriting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 24]: `` By the way , '' he continued , addressing the clerk , `` were you here when the murder took place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 9]: `` Did you see anything of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 5]: `` Not a scratch .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 17]: I was busy with a lady , who was worrying me about a train to Montclair .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 21]: She was five minutes making up her mind whether to take the Jersey tunnel or the 23rd Street ferry . ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 19]: `` The only other person , beside Curtis , who saw the whole affair was the hall-porter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 8]: `` I guess that 's so . ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 8]: `` Call him into the office . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 17]: Questioned anew , the hall-porter was positive about everything except Curtis 's connection with the attack .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 15]: The reporters had scalped him , metaphorically speaking , and his brain was seething .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 39]: He said `` No '' when he meant `` Yes , '' and `` Yes '' for `` No , '' and contradicted himself in each fresh version of the cataclasm which had seared his sky with lightning .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 10]: Steingall ultimately gave him up as hopeless that night .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 18]: Perhaps , next morning , when he had slept and eaten , he might become sane again .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 27]: `` It 's an odd thing that Curtis should have wandered away in this fashion , wearing a strange overcoat , '' mused the detective aloud .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 13]: `` He must know it , '' said the police captain meaningly .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 14]: `` I rather think we must force that door , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 23]: The clerk did not understand the reference to the overcoat , but he was ready enough to adopt the detective 's suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 16]: `` Shall I send for the engineer , and tell him to bring tools ? ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 15]: `` There is nothing else for it , '' admitted Steingall with a shrug .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 13]: Be it remembered he had seen Curtis , and heard his story .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 38]: If such a man had committed the most daring crime recorded in New York during a decade , and had flouted the police with such cool effrontery , he -LRB- Steingall -RRB- would never again trust impressions .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 46]: The policemen , the clerk , and a strong-armed artificer went up in the elevator , and , after an imperative knock and a loud-voiced summons to open had been met with blank silence from the interior of No. 605 , the workman got busy .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 11]: The door was stout , and offered a stubborn resistance .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 31]: It had to be forced off its upper hinge ; then it yielded so suddenly that it fell into the room , with the engineer sprawling on top of it .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 32]: The man yelled , thinking he was being plunged headlong into tragedy , but Steingall switched on the lights , and four pairs of eager eyes peered at nothing in particular .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 38]: They found the golf clubs , which partially explained the blocking of the door , though it did not occur to any of them at once that the open window might have caused the bag to fall .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 29]: They rummaged Curtis 's portmanteaux and steamer trunks , and came upon evidence in plenty to prove that he was no mere masquerader in another man 's name .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 5]: But that was all .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 41]: They could form no theory to account for his disappearance , until Steingall noticed the key , lying on the dressing-table , which , with its odds and ends of small articles , was the last place to invite scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 18]: He was gazing at it when the blind flapped , and the door of the wardrobe creaked .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 5]: `` Confound it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 9]: `` The bedroom door was fastened by accident !
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 6]: The man forgot his key .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 3]: Look here !
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 11]: I 'll show you just how it came about . ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 27]: He illustrated the slipping of the clubs , and his theory was borne out subsequently by the negro porter who had brought Curtis 's belongings upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 54]: But an atmosphere of suspicion , of non-comprehension , had been created around the missing man , and it was not to be dispelled , even in Steingall 's acute mind , by whittling away the mystery of the blocked door to a minor incident which might occur in any hotel any day .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 36]: Leaving the mechanic and the negro to patch the shattered door sufficiently to serve its purpose until it was replaced by another in the morning , the clerk escorted the representatives of the law downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 27]: Of course , their departure from the hall and their prolonged absence had been noted by the phalanx of reporters , and they were surrounded instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 47]: Searching questions were fired at them , but Steingall , who knew how to use the press for his own ends , countered by asking genially : `` In your hunt for copy , have any of you boys come across Mr. John D. Curtis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 9]: `` The man who really saw the riot ?
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 4]: I guess not .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 6]: We want him badly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 13]: An approving grin from his colleagues vouched for the speaker 's accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 10]: `` Who was killed , anyhow , Steingall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 9]: demanded the journalist who had answered the detective .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 9]: `` We do n't know , yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 6]: `` Does Curtis know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 29]: `` He said he did n't , but I 'll tell you something -- I sha n't be happy till I 've had another chat with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 18]: `` Can anyone say who ` John D. Curtis , of Pekin , ' really is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 5]: went on the reporter .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 10]: `` That is the man we are looking for .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 21]: If there are police officers present , I want them to understand that Curtis should be arrested at sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 19]: Everyone turned at the sound of the authoritative English voice which had intervened so unexpectedly in the conclave .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 19]: They saw an elderly man , well dressed , and bearing the unmistakable tokens of good social standing .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 45]: With him was a foreigner , a most truculent looking person , whose collar , shirt , and waistcoat carried other signs , quite as obvious , but curiously ominous in view of the cause of this gathering in the hall of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 11]: `` May I ask who you are , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 3]: said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 22]: `` I am the Earl of Valletort , '' said the stranger , `` and this is Count Ladislas Vassilan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 8]: Count Vassilan is not an Englishman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 18]: `` No , but -- '' `` Is he , by any chance , a Hungarian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 8]: `` Count Vassilan is a Hungarian prince .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 10]: But the nationality of either of us is unimportant .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 10]: Are you connected with the New York police ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 17]: He answered the Earl , but kept that microscopic eye of his fixed on the Count .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 6]: `` Very well , then .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 15]: I repeat that John D. Curtis must be found and arrested -- to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 8]: `` Because he is a dangerous adventurer .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 22]: I -- '' `` That 's a lie , first sizz out of the syphon , '' broke in another voice .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 14]: `` I have the honor to be a friend of John D. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 32]: My name is Howard Devar , and I 'll stand for John D. all the time against the noble Earl and any God 's quantity of blue-blooded , full-blooded Hungarians . ''
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 25]: Each member of the animated group was gazing at Devar 's boyish , self-possessed , well-chiseled face , when another interruption held them agog .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 17]: A stout , middle-aged man , followed by a stouter matron , bustled into the circle .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 30]: The newcomers were just as clearly Americans as the Earl was English , and the man cried angrily : `` Who says that John D. Curtis is a tough ?
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 6]: I 'm his uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 13]: `` And I 'm his aunt , '' chimed in the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 14]: `` Of Bloomington , Monroe County , Indiana , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 13]: `` Mr. and Mrs. Horace P. Curtis , '' announced the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 4]: `` Shake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 3]: said Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 24]: `` I heard about you to-day on board the _ Lusitania _ ... Now , my lord , we are three to two .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 11]: What charge do you bring against John D. Curtis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 31]: CHAPTER V NINE O'CLOCK A new note had crept into the voice of the taxi-cab driver when he stopped his vehicle in Madison Avenue and sought Curtis 's further commands .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 32]: No longer did he address his patron with a species of good-humored tolerance , almost of sarcasm ; his mental attitude had now become one of respect , even of hero-worship .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 30]: A little later , while smoking a thoughtful pipe in his own cozy flat somewhere near Second Avenue , he tried to explain this curious development to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 32]: `` You see , my dear , '' he said , `` I picked up a fare in Broadway , an ' took him where he said he wanted to go .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 46]: When he got out , he did n't seem to be quite sure whether he wanted to be there or not , an ' you can bet I smiled when he said that he supposed the lady he was callin ' on lived somewhere around .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 41]: Anyhow , after hesitatin ' a bit , an ' tellin ' me he would n't keep me a minnit , in he dives , an ' kep ' me coolin ' my heels a good quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 34]: I grew uneasy , because fares do get so nasty about waitin ' charges , so I signals the elevator man , name o ' Rafferty , to ask if it was O.K. .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 94]: When Rafferty comes back , we had a chat , an ' he tells me that this Miss Grandison -- a mighty smart piece she is , too , -- was goin ' to marry a little Frenchman right away -- she was expectin ' him to call at eight o'clock an ' take her to the minister 's place -- so it gev ' both Rafferty an ' me a jar when my dude turns up with the girl an ' pipes us for any old address where people could get married .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 39]: Well , I remembers the number of a shovel hat in 56th Street , an ' away we hike , man , girl , an ' lady 's maid , with never a sign of any Frenchman anywheres .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 19]: An ' , by Jove , in they skipped to the parsonage , an ' were spliced . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 6]: `` No , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 6]: exclaimed his highly interested hearer .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 3]: `` Fact .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 8]: True as I 'm sittin ' here .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 20]: When they were comin ' out , a queer lookin ' specimen who opened the door wished 'em happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 47]: ` Fair weather to you an ' your wife , sir , ' he said ; an ' Mr. Curtis -- that 's my fare 's name , I asked him -- said something about havin ' finished one long voyage an ' beginnin ' another .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 5]: Then the fun began .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 23]: I was just startin ' the machine when a private auto dashes up , an ' out jumps a foreign-lookin ' swell .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 53]: The girl spots him , an ' screams his name -- Count Vaseline it sounded like -- an ' he shouts , ` Here we are , Valtaw ' -- p ` raps that was his way of sayin ' Walter -- ` Got 'em , by -- You see after Hermione .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 9]: I 'll fix this -- Frenchman ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 15]: `` Do n't swear , George , '' remonstrated the driver 's better half .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 7]: `` I 'm not swearin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 11]: Ai n't I tellin ' you what he said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 5]: The point was waived .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 12]: `` And the lady 's name was Hermione , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 7]: It 's a pretty name . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 9]: `` You have n't got it quite right .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 11]: It was more like the way I said it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 40]: And , indeed , the correction was justified , since it is a regrettable fact that the taxi-cab driver 's wife made `` Hermione '' rhyme with `` bone , '' and laid no stress on the second syllable .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 29]: Strong in her superior knowledge , for she was an omnivorous reader of fiction -- and Greek names were fashionable last November -- she passed that point also .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 4]: she demanded breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 6]: `` Ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 5]: The narrator laughed joyfully .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 34]: `` The Dago Count went for Curtis as if he was on to a sure thing , but before you could say ` knife ' he was on his back on the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 11]: I 've never seen a man put down so quick .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 17]: I could n't have floored him so beautifully if I 'd hit him with a spanner .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 9]: But that was only part of the entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 32]: Curtis -- mind you , before that I 'd been treatin ' him as an ordinary dude in evenin ' dress -- acted like an injarubber man filled with chain lightning .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 48]: He shoved ` Valtaw ' back into the auto , grabs the brake an ' gear lever , an ' puts 'em both out of action , sweeps the two girls into my cab , and -- '' Here the taxi-driver bethought himself , and grinned vacuously .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 13]: `` Well -- an ' here I am , '' he concluded .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 15]: `` I suppose he handed out a good fare , '' said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 10]: `` Yes , he was quite decent about it .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 14]: Tipped me a couple of dollars over an ' above the register . ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 11]: `` I should have thought it would have been more .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 11]: Men are usually generous when they are getting married . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 32]: `` He was takin ' on a rather expensive bit of stuff , unless I am much mistaken , an ' p ` raps he was just rememberin ' it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 18]: In this ingenuous fashion was a poor woman neatly headed off the scent of a fifty-dollar bill .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 13]: She rang the knell of a new hat by her next question .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 15]: `` What was the young lady really like -- how was she dressed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 22]: ... Hardly a word was said within the taxi until the corner was turned out of 56th Street into Seventh Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 27]: Curtis , who was sitting with his back to the driver , rose , apologized for the disturbance , and looked through the tiny rear window .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 10]: `` That 's all right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 41]: `` That car wo n't be able to move for several minutes ; but we must leave nothing to chance , '' so he sank back into a seat , and permitted the driver to take them whither he listed .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 16]: Hermione 's first words were not exactly those of a fair maid in utmost distress .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 28]: `` Oh , how splendid it must be to feel sure that you are able to hit a wretch like Count Vassilan and knock him flat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 4]: Curtis was surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 30]: He could not see her kindling eyes , her parted lips , the color which was suffusing forehead and cheeks , and he rather expected to hear subdued sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 21]: `` I should hate to have you dislike me as thoroughly as you dislike that fellow , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 5]: `` I never could .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 15]: It can not be in your nature to treat women as he treats them .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 9]: I do hope you have hurt him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 15]: `` I am certain of that , at any rate , '' laughed Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 58]: `` He impressed me as weighing a hundred and ninety pounds or thereabouts , and , if it will afford you the slightest gratification , I 'll take the first opportunity to work out the approximate force required to drive back a moving body of that weight while traveling forward , say , fifteen miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 18]: There are angles of resistance to be calculated , too , so it offers a decent problem .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 13]: Meanwhile , the vital question is -- where are we going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 10]: Hermione was easily chaffed out of her bellicose mood .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 23]: He could picture the droop in the corners of her mouth as she said forlornly : `` I do not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 27]: `` It is evident , '' he went on , `` that they procured the minister 's address from the elevator man at your dwelling . ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 6]: `` Ah , that Rafferty !
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 11]: Wait till I see him , '' broke in Marcelle .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 13]: `` Please do not scarify Rafferty , if that is his name .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 33]: I am much more to be blamed than he , because I assured your mistress that the Earl and Count Vassilan were safe on board the _ Switzerland _ till the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 57]: I see now that they telegraphed for a tug , and it is best to assume that they have been kept informed by wireless of nearly every move in the game ... You agree with me , I suppose , Lady Hermione , that your return to 1000 59th Street is out of the question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 19]: `` It is , if this mock marriage is to serve any real purpose , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 12]: `` But pray remember that it is not a mock marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 23]: You and I are as firmly bound together by the law as if -- well , as if we meant it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 21]: She leaned forward a little ; her face was etched in Rembrandt lights by the glare from some shop windows .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 38]: `` Mr. Curtis , '' she said earnestly , `` it is neither just nor reasonable that you should plunge yourself into difficulties for the sake of a girl whom you met to-night for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 12]: Why not go out of my life now -- this instant ?
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 9]: ... Marcelle and I can find refuge somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 14]: The hour is early ... Why should you take all the risk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 11]: He was ready for some such appeal on her part .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 35]: `` I was taught in school if I did a thing at all to do it thoroughly , '' he said , `` and my experience of life has given the adage a halo .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 14]: It would be worse than useless to desert you now , Lady Hermione .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 19]: Whatever penalties I may have incurred in the eyes of the law are committed beyond hope of redemption .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 41]: If I am sought for , the police know exactly where to lay hands on me , and my crime would become monstrous if it were proved that I ran away from my wife on the night of our marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 12]: No ; we must face the music boldly , and together .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 38]: We must go to some well-known hotel , register openly , secure rooms , and conduct ourselves on the orthodox lines of all runaway couples , who are presumably head over heels in love with each other .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 31]: Moreover , in the morning , or whenever we are run to earth , you should allow me to face your father and play the part of the indignant husband .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 22]: It is essential that your marriage should appear real , or you go back to bondage and I to prison . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 5]: `` To prison ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 21]: The girl 's horrified accents showed that she had hardly given a thought to the bald consequences of her escapade .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 27]: I am not trying to frighten you ; but what sort of mercy would a judge show to the craven who absconded before the battle began ?
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 45]: If , on the other hand , I am , so to speak , torn from your arms -- if a plausible lawyer can depict you tearful and inconsolable -- if -- '' `` You make out a fairly strong case , Mr. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 28]: I have told you that I trust you , and I can only repeat my words of gratitude ... Marcelle , you will not leave me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 14]: `` Never , miss , ma'am -- that is , your ladyship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 25]: Thus it befell that Curtis was ready with the name of a prominent hotel in Fifth Avenue when the driver halted in Madison Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 28]: He made his choice almost at random , but selected one of the newest uptown caravanserais , merely because it lay a considerable distance from 27th Street .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 61]: Otherwise , his object in picking a large hotel being to avoid notice among a fashionable throng , he might easily have taken his `` wife '' to the Waldorf-Astoria , in which event certain complications even then hot in the making would not have followed their intricate course , while Hermione 's future must have been affected most powerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 18]: `` I suppose you are prepared to submit to certain conditions which govern this new venture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 16]: said Curtis , when the cab was once more speeding onward to a definite goal .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 6]: `` What are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 82]: It would be scarcely fair to describe Hermione 's tone as suspicious , for she was a loyal soul , and was wondering in her heart of hearts what manner of man this knight errant could be ; but his very self-possession fluttered her ; she had been so accustomed to think and act in her own defense that she experienced a subtle fear of this calm , cool-headed , masterful person whom she must learn to regard as her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 56]: `` Well , '' -- Curtis 's speech was so unemotional that he might have been describing one of his Manchurian railway schemes -- `` we must treat each other with a certain familiarity -- even use little endearments -- in public -- and address each other by pet names -- mine is Chow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 29]: Despite her troubles , the girl laughed , and Curtis recalled the tinkle of silver bells in a temple at evening on the banks of the far-away Wei-ho .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 11]: `` But that is the name of a dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 3]: she tittered .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 20]: In my case , it denoted some unpleasant personal characteristics when a stupid mandarin put obstacles in my way .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 35]: I never gave any warning , but rushed in and bit him , not actually , of course , but in his illicit commissions , which annoyed him more than a real bite . ''
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 11]: `` I do n't like Chow , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 6]: `` Your name is John .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 6]: Wo n't Jack do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 4]: `` Fine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 15]: It was lucky she could not see the smile that flitted across his face .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 5]: `` And yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 32]: `` Mamma always used my full name , and I have never had anyone else to give me a pet name , unless it was ` Tatters ' at school . ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 17]: `` We might bracket Tatters with Chow , and dismiss both , '' he said lightly .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 36]: `` And I like the sound of Hermione so well that it is pat on my lips already ... Now , you , Marcelle -- remember that her ladyship has become Lady Hermione Curtis . ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 8]: `` Oh , not Mrs. Curtis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 12]: An earl 's daughter retains her courtesy title after marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 6]: `` All right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 6]: I sha n't forget . ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 6]: Indeed , Marcelle was jubilant .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 28]: She had been `` dying '' to use her mistress 's title , once she became aware of it , but it was taboo at 59th Street .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 30]: Curtis had covered a good deal of ground during that brief discussion in the cab , but Hermione was not quite prepared for its logical sequel in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 13]: Naturally , they attracted no unusual attention when they entered the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 60]: Other people merely noticed the passing of a distinguished looking young man in evening dress -- for Curtis had promptly whipped off that ominous overcoat -- and a slender , veiled lady , of elegant carriage , who walked up to the bureau , followed by a smartly dressed girl who gazed about her with bright , all-seeing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 9]: -LSB- Illustration : Scenes from the photo-drama . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 23]: `` My wife and I have been detained in New York this evening unexpectedly , '' explained Curtis to the hotel clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 34]: `` We want a suite of rooms , a sitting-room , three bedrooms with baths -- you would like Marcelle 's room to communicate with yours , would n't you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 7]: and he turned suddenly to Hermione .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 14]: `` Y-yes , '' she faltered , for the attack took her unaware .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 6]: `` What floor , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 10]: We have a nice suite on the tenth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 11]: `` Not so high , please , '' said Hermione .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 10]: Then she sprung a mine on her own account .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 20]: `` I know it is stupid , Jack , darling , but I am so afraid of fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 57]: `` This hotel is absolutely fireproof , madam , '' put in the clerk , stating a fact implicitly believed by every hotel proprietor in New York in so far as his own building is concerned , `` but we can accommodate you on the second floor , Suite F. , fifty dollars a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 33]: That will be just right , '' said Curtis quickly , for he meant to live like a prince during one night at least , let the morrow bring its own cares .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 52]: `` Now , you understand that we are here without baggage , though my wife 's maid will procure some necessaries while we eat , and I mean to get some clothes later , but , if you would like a deposit of , say , a hundred dollars -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 26]: He felt for his pocketbook , but , to the credit of the clerk be it said , the suggestion was negatived with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 16]: `` No need at all for any deposit , sir , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 25]: `` I would n't be on to my job it I did n't know how and when to discriminate in matters of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 5]: Will you register ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 18]: Curtis took a pen and wrote : `` Mr. and Lady Hermione Curtis , and maid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 20]: Some imp of adventure moved him to inscribe `` Pekin '' in the column for visitors ' home addresses .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 23]: But the clerk was obviously impressed by Hermione 's title , no less than the singularly remote locality the couple hailed from .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 12]: He leant back , and took a key from its hook .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 4]: `` Page ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 32]: `` Show Mr. Curtis and her ladyship to Suite F. '' Then he added , as an afterthought : `` Would you like dinner served in your sitting-room , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 20]: `` I think so , '' said Curtis , `` but my wife shall decide a little later . ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 19]: Hermione kept silent until they were safely behind the closed door of a well-furnished and delightfully spacious apartment .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 14]: `` Of course , I bear all expenses , '' she said firmly .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 9]: `` What -- are we quarreling already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 15]: `` No , but -- '' `` You think I am being wildly extravagant .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 24]: Why , bless your ladyship 's dear little heart , this hotel does n't begin to know how to charge like a taxi .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 7]: Now , no argument till to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 42]: An American millionaire can really be quite a decent sort of fellow at times , and , if we may assume that this is one of the times , please let me play at being a millionaire -- for once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 15]: She raised her veil , and looked at him , straight in the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 10]: `` Why are you so different from other men ?
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 13]: Why have I never before spoken to a man like you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 34]: `` But I am not different , and there are plenty of men like me ; the other poor chaps have n't had my glorious chance of serving you -- that is all .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 25]: Now , wo n't you go and see if your room is comfortable , and whether or not Marcelle 's quarters are just right ?
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 26]: Then come back here , and we 'll discuss menus , for which purpose I shall ring for a waiter _ ek dum _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 6]: `` Is that Chinese ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 5]: `` No , Hindustani .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 17]: It means ` at once , ' but every hotel-wala east of Suez understands it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 4]: Still she lingered .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 11]: `` Have you any sisters -- a mother living ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 10]: I 'm the sole survivor of my own family .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 19]: But I mean to give myself the pleasure of a full introduction while we dine , or sup .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 7]: Do say you are hungry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 14]: `` I have not eaten a morsel since luncheon , '' she confessed .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 5]: `` Oh , joy !
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 7]: I must interview the head waiter .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 6]: No common serf will suffice .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 4]: Please hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 32]: She left him , not without an impulsive movement as though she meant to utter some further words of thanks , but checked her intent on the very threshold of speech .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 39]: As the lock of the bedroom door clicked , and he was alone , he essayed a review of the amazing sequence of events which had befallen since he strolled out of the dining-room of the Central Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 78]: He stood there , motionless , with hands plunged deep in his pockets , but , at the outset of a reverie in which judgment and prudence might have helped in the council , he happened to catch sight of himself in an oblong mirror over the mantelpiece , for the apartment , redolent of New York 's later architecture , contained an open grate , and was furnished with the chaste beauty of the Chippendale period .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 35]: In his present position the reflection in the mirror was oddly reminiscent of a half-length portrait of his grandfather , the warrior who rode at the head of the Fifth Cavalry in ' 61 .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 25]: Then Curtis laughed , with the pleasant conviction of a man whose mind has been made up for him by circumstances beyond his control .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 64]: `` It 's bred in the bone -- a clear case of Mendelism , '' he murmured softly , because he had just remembered how Colonel Curtis , before ever the war was ended and its bitterness assuaged , had decided a Southern girl 's conflict between love and duty by galloping fifty miles across Confederate South Carolina and carrying off the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 9]: Grandfather and grandson alike were men of action .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 13]: Curtis seldom used a gesture , and never cried over spilt milk .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 29]: Now he merely turned , peered into his own bedroom , assured himself that Hermione would find its prototype to her fancy , and then summoned a waiter .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 34]: Behind the closed door of the other room a girl was similarly engaged in taking stock of the situation ; but she had feminine assistance , so there was bound to be talk .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 22]: `` Oh , your ladyship , is n't this just the dandiest bit out of a novel you ever read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 14]: cried Marcelle when she entered her mistress 's room through a communicating door .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 23]: `` It might be more thrilling if it were not a page out of my own life , '' said Hermione sadly .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 41]: She , too , was gazing in a mirror , though , being a woman , the oppressive thought bobbed up through a sea of troubles that her hair must be untidy , and she owned neither comb nor brush .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 24]: `` But , what luck , miss , your ladyship , to have found a gentleman like Mr. Curtis at the right moment .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 33]: Talk about life buoys for drowning men and rich uncles from California in plays -- who ever heard of anyone wanting a nice husband and getting him in such a way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 7]: Marcelle 's eyes were positively glistening .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 24]: And these two now were not mistress and maid , but a pair of highly strung women , and young ones at that .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 18]: `` You have lost your wits in this night 's excitement , Marcelle , '' said Hermione .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 14]: `` Do n't you realize that I am only married under mere pretense .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 12]: Mr. Curtis is nothing to me , nor I to him .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 26]: He has been kind and gallant , and I am under an obligation which I can never discharge -- but that is not marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 11]: `` It 's awful like it , your ladyship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 7]: Drive such nonsense from your head .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 28]: When you marry , do n't you hope to love the man of your choice , and will you not feel sure that he loves you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , miladi . ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 21]: `` Then how is it possible for any relationship of that sort to exist between Mr. Curtis and me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 15]: `` You 've gone a long way already , ma'am , '' giggled Marcelle .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 8]: `` Please do n't call me ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 7]: It -- it irritates me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 28]: `` Sorry , miladi , but you will admit , at least , a marriage being necessary , that you were fortunate in finding Mr. Curtis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 18]: `` Yes , doubly fortunate -- it is that fact which makes things hard for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 10]: `` Makes what things hard , your ladyship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 8]: `` Oh , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 7]: I scarce recognize my own voice .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 17]: Marcelle , if I seem distraught and unreasonable , promise me you will pay no heed .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 11]: For pity 's sake , do n't leave me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 16]: Hermione 's eyes filled with tears , and Marcelle was on the verge of hysteria .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 20]: `` I -- ca n't imagine -- what there is -- to cry about , '' she murmured brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 41]: `` Nothing on earth would induce me to go away now -- but I do hope -- and pray -- you will be happy -- even though -- you only met your husband -- little more than an hour ago !
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 38]: ... And I believe in my heart , Lady Hermione , that you will soon see how fortunate you were in escaping that mincing little Frenchman -- '' `` Marcelle , the poor man is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 14]: `` Then it is the best turn he has done you , miladi .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 5]: I never fancied him .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 9]: There was something underhanded and mean about him .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 21]: I have seen his face when you were not looking , and I 'm sure he was a hypocrite . ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 9]: `` Marcelle , you will drive me crazy .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 16]: Do n't you understand that I have never intended to marry anybody -- really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 15]: A knock at the door opening into the sitting-room came to Hermione 's relief .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 30]: `` If you can spare Marcelle , I would recommend that she should go to your flat for any clothes you may need , '' said Curtis 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 6]: Hermione threw open the door .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 22]: `` A little while ago you told me that it was impossible to think of returning there , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 12]: `` For you , yes , but not for your maid .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 5]: Who is to hinder ?
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 13]: That man , Rafferty , looked a decent sort of fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 13]: `` I can manage Rafferty all right , '' put in Marcelle .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 10]: `` Of course you can , '' smiled Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 35]: `` Just pack a trunk or a couple of bags with Lady Hermione 's belongings -- you know what to bring -- and get Rafferty to call a taxi without attracting too much notice .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 15]: If you think you are being followed , put your pursuers off the scent .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 21]: But my own view is that 1000 59th Street is the last place anyone will think of watching to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 11]: `` Shall I go at once , your ladyship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 20]: said Marcelle , and Hermione said `` Yes , '' with a meekness that was admirable in a wife .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 9]: Curtis looked at his pretty bride 's hat .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 11]: `` I have ordered a meal , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 11]: `` It will be served in a few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 18]: `` I shall be ready , '' she replied , beginning nervously to take off her gloves .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 24]: The wedding ring was inclined to accompany the left hand glove , but , after a second 's hesitation , she replaced it .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 31]: When she appeared in the sitting-room she had discarded her jacket , a close-fitting one of a style that fastened _ à la militaire _ , high in the neck .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 28]: Beneath it she had been wearing a white silk blouse , and the delicate pink of her arms and throat was revealed now through its diaphanous sheen .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 35]: A string of pearls supported a diamond cross on her breast , and on her left wrist was a watch set in small diamonds and turquoises and carried by a bracelet of gold filigree .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 28]: She wore only one ring -- _ the _ ring -- and even the slight glance which Curtis gave it brought a vivid blush to her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 39]: `` I am not a past master in the art of ordering banquets , '' he said cheerily , turning at once to draw her attention to the table , `` but the head-waiter here is a gourmet .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 23]: He suggested caviare , a white soup , a king-fish , a tourne-dos , and a grouse -- does that appeal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 19]: `` You take my breath away , '' she said , with valorous effort to seem at ease .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 8]: `` Now -- as to wine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 7]: `` I seldom touch wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 8]: `` To-night it will make you sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 12]: What do you say to a glass of Clos Vosgeot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 7]: `` Is that a claret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 16]: `` Well , as it happens , that is the one wine I take . ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 6]: The dinner proceeded most pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 34]: To his own astonishment , Curtis worked up sufficient appetite to enjoy the meal , though he would have stuffed himself remorselessly to save his charming _ vis-à-vis _ from the slightest embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 23]: But he only sipped the wine , for a sixth sense warned him that he must keep a clear head that night .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 54]: By inference rather than plain statement , for a deft waiter was constantly coming in and out , he supplied Hermione with glimpses of his own career , and ascertained from her that she had secured Marcelle 's services through the good offices of a lady who was a fellow-passenger on the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 23]: `` She comes from New Orleans , but , notwithstanding her name , she does not speak French , '' said Hermione .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 40]: `` I think that rather accounts for -- '' She stopped , and Curtis did not press for an explanation , but she continued , after a second 's pause : `` Marcelle did not like Monsieur de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 20]: I imagined she was annoyed because he always conversed with me in a language she did not understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 11]: `` Then I shall avoid Chinese , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 8]: `` Marcelle -- '' Again she hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 22]: She was positively dismayed by consciousness of the imminent disclosure , yet too well-bred even to appear to be withholding confidences .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 14]: `` You have won Marcelle 's golden opinion already , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 10]: `` But let us talk of something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 17]: For the moment they were alone , and she glanced at the watch on her wrist .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 8]: `` Have you made any plans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 13]: she inquired , and her voice was low , yet sufficiently composed .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 6]: `` For the future ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 15]: `` When Marcelle arrives , I am going to my hotel for some baggage .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 11]: You , I suggest , are going to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 6]: `` You will return ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 11]: `` Within the hour -- if I am alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 5]: `` And to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 17]: `` To-morrow , may it please your ladyship , we breakfast together at nine o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 15]: `` Your plan , then , is mainly composed of eating and sleeping ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 12]: `` What else -- our policy is one of drifting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 12]: `` You are extraordinarily good to me , Mr. Curtis . ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 11]: `` It is ` Jack ' in the compact . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 3]: She sighed .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 10]: `` Alas , this compact reads only one way .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 9]: It means that you give and I receive .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 26]: Will you -- will you believe , in the future , that despair alone could have driven me to the course I have pursued ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 8]: `` No , '' he said sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 3]: `` No ?
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 11]: That is the only unkind thing you have said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 14]: `` I refuse to vilify happy chance in the name of black despair .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 11]: But -- here is Marcelle , and slaves bearing packages .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 9]: I hear thuds in the next room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 34]: And , indeed , the waiter entering just then with coffee , Marcelle 's voice reached them sharply from the corridor : `` Now , you boy , be careful with that hat-box !
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 13]: Do you think you are an express man , or what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 27]: CHAPTER VI NINE-THIRTY Chance is often a skilled stage manager , and chance had arranged a really effective scene in the hall of the Central Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 59]: The Earl of Valletort seemed to be somewhat unwilling to take up any of the gauntlets so readily thrown down by Devar and the Curtis family , and , for a few seconds , the ring of reporters was held spellbound by a situation which promised most excellently with regard to the all-important question of `` copy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 33]: Then the police captain , after waiting for Steingall to take the lead , nudged his silent colleague , and said gruffly : `` This thing can not be gone into here .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 23]: Those who can bring forward testimony of any value ought to come with Mr. Steingall and myself to the precinct station-house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 12]: `` Why lose time which can not be overtaken later ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 23]: urged the Earl , appealing to Steingall , since it was the detective who had spoken to him in the first instance .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 13]: `` We appear to be at cross purposes , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 17]: `` How did you two gentlemen get to know that a murder had been committed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 4]: `` Murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 4]: gasped Count Vassilan .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 39]: `` We are not talking of a murder , but of a most scandalous abduction , which will provide only one of a number of most serious charges against this person , Curtis , '' cried the Earl .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 8]: Vassilan seized him by the arm excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 15]: `` Do n't you understand , dear friend , '' he muttered in French .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 19]: `` The rascal must have killed de Courtois in order to gain possession of the marriage certificate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 18]: `` It will save trouble , sir , if you speak English here , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 8]: Then he turned to the hotel clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 10]: `` Place a room at our disposal at once .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 6]: Lord Valletort is quite right .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 9]: We have not a second to waste . ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 33]: A murmur of protest arose from the pressmen , though it was obvious that the police could not conduct the inquiry in the midst of an ever-growing crowd of residents and servants .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 26]: `` Say , Steingall , '' whispered the reporter who had spoken for the others earlier , `` ca n't you let us into this ?
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 18]: We 'll suppress anything you wish -- I 'll guarantee that , absolutely without reservation . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 22]: _ I _ have no objection , but these high-toned strangers may not like it , '' said the detective quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 30]: The Earl , when the point was referred to him , made no difficulty whatsoever about the presence of the journalists -- in fact , he rather welcomed publicity .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 21]: `` It is better that the truth should appear than a garbled and misleading version , '' he said affably .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 8]: `` I want your help , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 48]: I know enough of newspaper ways to feel sure that a story of some sort will be star-headed in every news sheet in New York to-morrow , so my friend , Count Vassilan , and I are more than willing that you should be well informed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 20]: Now , that phase of the problem was precisely what Count Ladislas Vassilan seemed to be exceedingly disconcerted about .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 7]: He was singularly ill at ease .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 30]: His florid face had paled to a dusky wanness when he heard the ugly word `` Murder , '' and each passing moment served only to increase his agitation .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 37]: Steingall , to all intents and purposes paying less heed to the man than to any other person present , had not missed one labored breath , one twitch of an eyelid , one nervous gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 16]: His phenomenal instinct in the detection of crime had fastened unerringly on a singular coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 21]: Curtis had hazarded a guess that the real malefactors were Hungarians , and here was a Hungarian Count denouncing Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 9]: Certainly that question of nationality promised remarkable developments .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 33]: When the whole party , consisting of some fifteen persons , had gathered behind the closed door of the hotel 's private office , Steingall took the lead in directing the proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 33]: `` It will help straighten out a tangle if I say exactly what has taken place here to-night -- that is , to the best of our knowledge , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 30]: `` There is every reason to believe that Mr. John D. Curtis arrived in New York this afternoon from Europe -- '' `` Right , '' broke in Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 12]: `` I traveled with him on the _ Lusitania _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 20]: `` Yes , his presence on board was announced in most of the papers , '' added a journalist .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 11]: `` Please do n't interrupt , '' said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 9]: `` You will be heard in your turn .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 31]: Now , this Mr. Curtis was allotted room No. 605 , and there is evidence to prove that he behaved like any ordinary individual who had just come from shipboard .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 27]: He superintended the unpacking of his clothes , gave out a quantity of linen for the laundry , changed into evening dress , and dined alone .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 26]: Thus far , there is ample corroboration of his own story , because his movements can be checked by the observation of half-a-dozen hotel employés .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 47]: He says , by the way , that while buying some stamps at the cigar counter before going to the restaurant , he was jostled by a rough-looking foreigner , who apologized in broken French , and whom he took to be a Czech or Hungarian .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 22]: No one seems to have witnessed this incident , but I have not questioned the man who sold him the stamps .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 40]: Anyhow , after dinner , at twenty minutes of eight to be exact , he came into the lobby , intending to inform the clerk that he had closed the bedroom door and left his key in the room .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 38]: We have ascertained that this statement is true ; the door had to be forced , because a bag of golf clubs had fallen and become wedged between the door and the side of a steel trunk .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 50]: Curtis never did speak to the clerk about the key ; at that instant , he says , his attention was drawn to the queer behavior of the foreigner who had pushed against him , and who had been joined in the meantime by another man of similar type .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 43]: They seemed to be very excited , and were apparently expecting someone to turn up , either in the street or from the hotel -- Curtis fancied that they were on the look-out for interruption , or news , from both quarters .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 33]: The porter on duty at the door , who is not quite intelligible to-night , remembers asking these men if they wanted a taxi , but they gave no heed to him .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 53]: Then , according to Curtis 's version of the affair , an automobile dashed up outside , and a young man in evening dress , carrying an overcoat , stepped out , and told the chauffeur to keep the engine going , as he would not be detained more than a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 27]: At that instant the two foreigners -- Hungarians according to Curtis -- sprang at the newcomer , and endeavored to force him back into the auto .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 31]: Failing in this , one of them drew a knife , and stabbed him so severely that he died within a few minutes , and without uttering an intelligible word .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 40]: Curtis ran to help , but was too far away to prevent the crime , and was further balked in an attempt to seize either of the wretches by having the dying man 's body flung in his way .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 64]: He endeavored to hinder the escape of the scoundrels in the automobile , but failed , because the chauffeur was evidently in league with them , and , when he came back to the crowd which had collected around the prostrate man , it would appear that someone gave him , by mistake , the victim 's overcoat in place of his own .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 35]: This error was not discovered until the police came to search the dead man 's clothing , when various documents showed beyond question that the overcoat believed to be his was really Curtis 's .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 26]: Curtis told his story in a clear and straightforward way , and I , for one , have not seen any reason to doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 57]: It is odd that he should have disappeared so completely since a few minutes after the crime , but that may be capable of a simple explanation , while it is possible that he has not as yet discovered the change of overcoats , or he must surely have returned and informed us of the mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 42]: I am assuming , of course , that he would act as one would expect of any reasonable minded citizen who had witnessed a serious crime ... Now , Lord Valletort , what have you to say about Mr. Curtis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 12]: A guttural exclamation from Count Vassilan drew all eyes to him .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 17]: He seemed to be on the verge of collapse , and was positively livid with fright .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 41]: In other conditions than those obtaining at the moment , such a display of terror on the part of a truculent looking , strongly built man would have been almost ludicrous ; but Steingall found no humor in the spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 51]: He was gazing at the Hungarian with a curious concentration , and the police captain , who had begun by thinking his colleague was saying far too much , and who was inclined to disagree with some of his conclusions , now thought he could discern method in his madness .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 53]: Again did Vassilan murmur something to the Earl in a strange tongue , and Valletort , with difficulty repressing his annoyance , explained that his friend was feeling the effects of a blow received earlier in the evening , and wished to retire at once to his room in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 10]: `` By all means , '' said Steingall suavely .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 24]: `` I gather that Count Vassilan has no connection with the inquiry -- in fact , he is not interested in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 30]: `` He is , in a sense -- '' began the Earl , but Vassilan grasped his arm , and evidently besought him to come away without another word .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 21]: Though Valletort was in a towering rage , he obviously thought fit to fall in with his companion 's views .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 23]: `` You see how it is , '' he said , with a nonchalant gesture that was belied by his grating tone .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 23]: `` I am afraid I must postpone my branch of this inquiry till a later hour -- probably until the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 12]: `` Do you withdraw all charges against John D. Curtis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 17]: demanded Devar , and his clear , incisive voice was distinctly hostile in its icy precision .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 10]: I do not , '' was the angry retort .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 43]: `` Well , I guess you know best why you and the Hungarian potentate have developed this sudden attack of cold feet , but -- '' `` I 'll thank you not to interfere , Mr. Devar , '' said Steingall determinedly .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 25]: `` If Lord Valletort thinks his business can wait till Count Vassilan has recovered from an indisposition , that is his affair only . ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 13]: `` I think nothing of the sort , '' snapped the Earl .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 21]: `` You all see that the Count is ill , and common humanity impels me to attend to him first .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 25]: It may serve to curb this young gentleman 's tongue if I say -- '' But Vassilan would not permit him to say anything .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 20]: Though he was the ailing man , he literally dragged Valletort out of the room and into the street .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 13]: Steingall looked at the police captain , who quitted the apartment instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 33]: Then the detective gazed around at the others with a placid smile which seemed to show that he , for one , was well content with the unusual turn taken by events .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 28]: `` I suppose you boys have verbatim notes of all that was said , '' he inquired , tossing the remark collectively to the group of pressmen .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 9]: `` Every word , '' came the assurance .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 18]: `` Well , now , I want you to keep all that out of the papers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 14]: `` If we do that , Steingall , what is there left ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 6]: said one of them good-humoredly .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 30]: `` The biggest thing you have dropped on to this year ; unless I am greatly mistaken , the scoop of scoops for those who happen to be present .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 35]: I 'm not going to pretend that any of you are blind or deaf , and it will assist the police materially if no comment is made on what you have heard and seen .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 45]: I do n't like to put it otherwise than as a friendly hint ; but I may want the whole bunch as witnesses before this thing is through , so your mouths should be closed effectually with regard to incidents in this room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 36]: A half-hearted laugh went around , and someone asked : `` We must put up a readable story of some kind -- if we cut out certain details , surely we can use others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 15]: `` I said ` incidents in this room , ' '' repeated the detective .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 18]: `` Then we can mention the arrival of the Earl and the Count on the scene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 14]: `` One minute , sir , '' put in Mr. Horace P. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 31]: `` If these gentlemen take you at your word , the charge made against my nephew will be published throughout the length and breadth of the United States to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 19]: `` I do n't see how something of the sort is to be avoided , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 36]: `` Then , in common fairness , the newspapers ought to state that my wife and I , as well as Mr. Devar , as good as told the Earl that he was lying . ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 23]: `` I imagine you can leave the matter safely in the very capable hands of the reporters present , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 18]: `` Remember , please , that no charge was actually named against Curtis , '' said Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 58]: `` The Earl of Valletort demanded that he should be found and arrested , and described him as a dangerous adventurer , but gave no shred of proof of his wild-cat statement that Curtis had been engaged in a scandalous abduction , and , when asked for it , discovered that he had urgent business elsewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 9]: Steingall held up a hand in quiet reproof .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 34]: `` My own view is that it would be best , at this stage , to say merely that the two noblemen came here inquiring for Curtis , and leave it at that .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 12]: I am not trying to deprive the press of a sensation .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 43]: Surely there is enough in Chapter One for to-night , and those reporters who have had the luck to be present will be able to fill in gaps in Chapters Two and Three when they come along to-morrow or next day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 19]: `` Right , '' said the journalist who , by tacit agreement , seemed to represent his confrères .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 20]: `` There are one or two items we want you to clear up , if you do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 17]: First , did Curtis , or anybody else , note the number of the automobile ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said Steingall instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 22]: `` The number is X24-305 , and Curtis heard the man who was murdered address the chauffeur as ` Anatole . '
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 10]: He spoke French to the man , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 20]: `` You omitted both of those interesting facts from your summary , '' commented the reporter with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 4]: `` Did I ?
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 12]: That was a piece of sheer forgetfulness on my part . ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 22]: `` You did n't forget to rope us all in here as witnesses when the Hungarian prince came on the boards .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 17]: I knew you had something up your sleeve the moment you began to fill in details .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 22]: But , as to the crime itself -- have you found out the name of the man who was killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 24]: There were no papers in his clothes , but that may be accounted for by the singular accident of the exchange of overcoats .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 30]: His linen was marked ` H. R. H. ' '' '' ` H. R. H. , ' '' cried a bespectacled journalist who had been a silent listener hitherto .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 6]: `` That 's rather odd .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 15]: Those are the initials of Henry R. Hunter , a member of our staff .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 45]: The news editor wanted him to take hold in the first instance when the fact that a murder had been committed was ` phoned to the office , but he could not be found anywhere , so I am here in his stead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 15]: `` I do n't recall anyone of that name , '' said Steingall sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 7]: `` No , you would n't .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 12]: He was in our Chicago office till the beginning of September .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 33]: He did one or two bright things there that caught the chief 's eye , so he was brought to New York ... By Jove , Hunter is a good French scholar .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 18]: It was on that account he got on the track of a gang of Chicago anarchists . ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 8]: A curious stillness fell on the gathering .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 25]: It was as though a spirit of evil had suddenly made its presence felt ; even the electric lamps seemed to have grown dimmer .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 5]: `` Describe Hunter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 28]: Steingall 's voice rang out incisively ; the reporter took off his spectacles , and began to burnish them , for his face was glistening with perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 21]: `` He is about five feet ten inches in height , and weighs somewhere in the neighborhood of 150 pounds .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 37]: He is straight and well-built , and his face is finely molded , with big , luminous eyes , deeply recessed , and -- '' `` Has he a white scar across the left eyebrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 17]: For some reason , the journalist carried his description of Hunter 's personal appearance no farther .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 4]: It was unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 37]: Before Steingall uttered another word everyone in the room had a foreboding that they were on the threshold of a discovery which lifted this tragedy into a prominence far beyond aught they had yet dreamed of .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 20]: Except for that momentary touch of amazement in the detective 's tone they could gather nothing from his manner .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 22]: But his invariable habit was to speak to the point , and without the least suggestion of ambiguity in his words .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 23]: `` I am very much afraid , gentlemen , that the murdered man is Mr. Henry B. Hunter , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 19]: `` I must trouble you to come with me , and place the question of identity beyond doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 25]: I hope that you , Mr. and Mrs. Curtis , and you , Mr. Devar , will make it convenient to await my return .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 13]: There are matters on which you can give me valuable information . ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 10]: In a few seconds the three found themselves alone .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 24]: The clerk had business to attend to , but he courteously invited them to remain in the office until the detective came back .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 20]: `` Did you ever hear such nonsense as this talk about Curtis being mixed up in an abduction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 19]: began Devar , eager to dispossess his friend 's relatives of any false impressions they might have formed .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 21]: `` Why , he did n't know a soul in the States -- except yourselves , '' he added tactfully .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 78]: The uncle , who had been polishing his domed forehead with a large handkerchief at intervals during the past quarter of an hour , cleared his throat as a preliminary to some important announcement , but his better half had only kept silent because of a real fear that her nephew had been engaged in the commission of serious crime from the instant he set foot in New York , and she entered the fray vigorously now .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 22]: `` We do n't know much about him , and that 's the truth , Mr. Devar , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 258]: `` There was some family disagreement years ago , and the brothers lost track of each other , but Horace here never forgets a name , and why should he , seeing that John was his father 's name , and Delancy his mother 's , and our nephew has both , so the minute we saw that paragraph in the Chicago papers about the eminent American engineer who had been building railways in China being on board the _ Lusitania _ , I says to Horace : ` Horace , it would be shame on us if we allowed your brother 's son and your own nephew to arrive in New York without some of his kith and kin to bid him welcome , ' and with that we hustled to catch the next train east , but the steamer did the trip quicker 'n we counted on , and we just missed being at the docks , so if it had n't been for our good luck in finding the man who helped John with his baggage , and who remembered the name of the hotel he gave the taxi-driver , we might have been searching New York all this blessed night without dreaming of coming to such a place as this , because the newspapers spoke so highly of John that we made sure he would be stopping in one of the Fifth Avenue hotels like the Waldorf-Astoria or Hoffman House , or perhaps higher uptown , in the Ritz-Carlton or the Plaza . ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 37]: Mrs. Curtis was stout , so she yielded perforce to lack of breath , and Devar was able to explain smilingly that he , and none other , was responsible for the item in the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 18]: `` The fact is that I took a great liking to John D. , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 49]: `` He is such a real good fellow , and so sublimely unconscious of his own merits , that I wanted to surprise him by starting a modest boom in the press , so I sent a wireless message about him to a journalistic friend in New York .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 70]: I wondered why the reporters did not get hold of him when they came aboard at the quarantine station , but I remember now that , by some curious trick of fate , he and I stowed ourselves away in a part of the ship where no one was likely to find us , and I clean forgot to put them on his track when I went below . ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 26]: `` I guess my nephew has attended to the booming proposition on his own account , '' said Horace , getting under way at last .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 9]: Devar laughed , but Mrs. Curtis was shocked .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 4]: `` Horace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 19]: she cried indignantly , `` that 's the only unkind thing I 've heard you say in years .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 76]: Oh , yes , '' -- for her husband had spread his hands in mild protest -- `` I know you did n't mean it , but barbed shafts of humor often fall in places where they hurt , and it is terrible to think of your nephew being mixed up in a murder , and an abduction , and -- '' She broke off in mid-career , and fixed a stern eye on Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 19]: `` Are you quite sure he did n't get flirting with some giddy young thing on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 16]: `` I 've heard and read of some strange goings-on among people crossing the Atlantic .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 32]: I could tell you of two marriages and no less than five divorces which -- '' Devar was a polite young man , but he thought the situation called for firmness .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 26]: `` To the best of my belief , your nephew never so much as spoke to any lady on the ship , '' he vowed .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 40]: `` He read a good deal , and played cards occasionally , and walked the decks with me when the weather permitted , but he did not even mention a woman 's name except your own , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 15]: `` The marvel is that he mentioned us at all , '' said Horace .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 30]: Devar thought in his own mind , that the elder Curtis might be ponderous in body and speech but he certainly revealed horse sense when he opened his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 14]: `` And whose fault was that , I should like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 4]: cried Mrs. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 62]: `` Did n't your own brother quarrel with you because you said he ought to have married a woman of some stability of character , and not a pretty , feather-headed girl who spent her days reading poetry and her nights in attending lectures , and who did n't begin to understand the A.B.C. of a wife 's domestic duties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 15]: `` Maybe I was wrong and he was right , '' said her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 4]: `` Horace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 41]: Mrs. Curtis was marshaling her forces for a mighty effort when the door opened , and Steingall entered , accompanied by a tall , well set-up man in evening dress , and wearing an open overcoat and green Homburg hat .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 26]: `` Well , '' cried Devar , springing forward with outstretched hand , `` I 'm mighty glad to see you , John D. ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 24]: The newcomer 's face lit with pleasure , but before he could utter a responsive word Mrs. Curtis gurgled : `` John D. !
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 7]: ... Are you John Delancy Curtis ?
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 9]: ... Horace , is this your nephew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 27]: `` Judging from his looks , Louisa , he ought to be , '' said the stout man , gazing at the stranger with wide-eyed astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 14]: The Christian names of the couple acted like a galvanic battery on Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 38]: At first , he could hardly believe his ears , but some resemblance in the portly Curtis to his own father warned him that this night of nights had not yet exhausted its store of stupefying surprises .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 4]: `` Why ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 20]: he exclaimed , smiling cheerfully , `` you must be my uncle and aunt from Bloomington , Indiana ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 18]: `` If you 're John Delancy Curtis , that 's our correct description , '' said Horace .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 11]: `` Of course he is , '' chortled Mrs. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 34]: `` He 's as like you the day I married you as two peas in a pod , and if our little Horace had been spared he would have been his living image .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 21]: Nephew , I 'm proud to meet you , '' and Mrs. Curtis folded her relation in an ample embrace .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 9]: Curtis carried off a difficult situation with ease .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 34]: He kissed his aunt , shook hands with his uncle , and was about to answer the lady 's torrent of questions with regard to himself and his own people when Steingall interfered .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 27]: `` Sorry to interrupt you , '' he said , `` but the turn taken by to-night 's crime demands your immediate attention , Mr. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 13]: Do you know you are wearing the dead man 's overcoat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 9]: I discovered that fact some time ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 37]: Curtis 's prompt admission was more favorable to his cause than he could possibly realize then , though he had seen that the detective 's extraordinarily brilliant eyes were fixed on the garment 's blood-stained sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 11]: `` And have you learnt the owner 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 5]: went on Steingall quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 23]: `` Yes , that is , I believe so , owing to a document I found in one of the pockets . ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 8]: `` Ah , what was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 22]: `` It concerned another person , but I am prepared to tell you its nature if it is absolutely essential . ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 13]: `` Believe me , there must be no concealment -- now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 31]: Something in the detective 's tone conveyed a hint of peril , of suspicion , to the ears of one so accustomed to dealing with his fellow-men as was Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 27]: But he shook off the premonition of ill , and decided , once and for all , to be candor itself where the authorities were concerned .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 11]: `` It was a marriage license , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 8]: `` And the names on it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 23]: `` They were those of a Frenchman , Jean de Courtois , and of an English lady , Hermione Beauregard Grandison . ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 19]: `` So you have imagined that the man who was killed was this Monsieur Jean de Courtois ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 26]: For the life of him , Curtis could not prevent the tumultuous pumping of his heart from drawing some of the color from his face .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 5]: `` Who else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 11]: he inquired , never flinching from Steingall 's searching gaze .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 37]: `` No matter who owned the coat , or whom the license was intended for , the murdered man was no Frenchman , but a New York journalist named Henry R. Hunter , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 25]: Then Curtis yielded to the swift conviction that he had unwittingly trapped Lady Hermione into a marriage on grounds that were inadequate and false .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 5]: `` Good God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 42]: he muttered , and , for the moment , it was impossible for his hearers to resist the dreadful inference that , in some shape or form , he was implicated in the outrage which bulked so large in their minds .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 12]: Mrs. Curtis wanted to scream aloud , but she dared not .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 11]: Even Devar was staggered by his friend 's unaccountable attitude .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 11]: The only outwardly unmoved individual present was Horace P. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 19]: He turned and pressed an electric bell ; Steingall glared at him , so he explained his action .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 12]: `` I feel like a highball , '' he said blandly .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 11]: `` I guess Mrs. Curtis could do with one also .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 13]: In fact , five highballs would be a bully good notion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 30]: CHAPTER VII TEN O'CLOCK Curtis had seized the opportunity while Hermione was in her room before dinner to rub the blood-stained sleeve of the overcoat with a wet cloth .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 52]: He had not , of course , been able to eradicate the ghastly dye wholly from the thick material , but the garment was now wearable , at any rate by night , and he had little fear of attracting attention as he crossed the brilliantly lighted foyer of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 30]: Passing out by the Fifth Avenue exit , he began the second cigar of the evening , and stood in the porch for a moment to collect his faculties .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 20]: The time was five minutes of ten , and he had been married about an hour and a half .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 45]: He had just finished his second dinner , and for the guerdon of companionship with the charming and gracious girl whom fate had figuratively thrown into his arms he would cheerfully have tackled a third meal without any personal qualms as to subsequent indigestion .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 9]: But , joking apart , he was married .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 29]: That was the overwhelming feature of life , a feature which dwarfed every other circumstance much as grimly gigantic Windsor Castle dominates the puny town beneath its walls .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 12]: The mere tying of the matrimonial knot had not troubled him .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 45]: He was heart whole and fancy free then -- or , not to strain the metaphor , he could have boasted those attributes a little earlier in the evening -- and he recked nothing of the really serious legal disabilities incurred by the adventure .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 58]: But , like every other young man , his thoughts had turned sometimes to a young woman -- not any special young woman , but that nebulous entity which is necessarily bound up with the notion that some day , somewhere , somehow , a man will encounter the maid in whose limpid eyes lurks his destiny .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 51]: He had pictured the desirable one in day-dreams , and , merely because of his violent antipathy towards the Eurasian element in the Far East , the dulcissima had appeared invariably as a tall , slender creature , with the lightest of flaxen hair and the grayest of gray eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 63]: Now , some alchemy devised by the magician spirit of New York had fashioned his ideal , though slender , not so tall , and she owned a wealth of brown hair , hair that shone and glistened in every changing light , while her eyes were either blue or violet , just as one happened to catch the glint of them .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 30]: And she had fascinating ways , too , which the lady of his fantasy could never have displayed , or he would not have abandoned the vision so readily .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 13]: When she smiled , it was with lips and eyes in unison .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 23]: When she spoke he heard harmonies not framed in mere words , whereas the other fair dame was unquestionably a deaf mute .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 48]: Indeed , while his glance was dwelling , to all outward semblance , on the passing traffic of one of New York 's busiest thoroughfares , he was admitting to himself that he was deeply , irrevocably , in love , and the knowledge was almost stupefying .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 22]: To one of Curtis 's temperament it seemed to be a wildly fanciful thing that he should have yielded so swiftly .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 60]: Two hours ago he had not seen Hermione , did not even know her name , whereas now he breathed it with devout reverence , though , with a perverseness seldom attached to such circumstances , the amazing fact that she was his wife formed a stubborn barrier against which the flood of new-born desire must rage in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 13]: For , above all else , he held dear his plighted word .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 24]: He knew now that the marriage offered an almost insuperable obstacle to any effort on his part to win the girl 's affections .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 55]: In her despair she had trusted him , and he awoke with a guilty start to consciousness of that winsome face being wrung with a new terror if for one instant she had reason to suspect him of other than the altruistic motives he had professed in giving her the protection of his name .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 47]: Perhaps , in time -- well , he was done now with moon-madness , and he stepped briskly down the avenue , firm set in purpose to risk everything for his wife 's sake , and let the future rest in the lap of the gods .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 14]: This , be it noted , was his first stroll in New York .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 55]: The night was fine and clear , for Rafferty 's diagnosis of `` a touch of frost in the air '' was becoming justified , and no thoroughfare in the world could lend itself more completely to the romance of that walk than the wonderful promenade which leads from Central Park to Madison Square .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 56]: With few exceptions , the nineteenth century plutocrat has been ousted from that section of Fifth Avenue ; a giant democracy has reared its own palaces in the shape of hotels and office buildings which pierce the skies , stores which rival the proudest mansions of Venice in its heyday and Florence under Lorenzo Medici .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 20]: Never in after life did Curtis forget that intimate glimpse of the grandeur and wealth of his native place .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 46]: Coming up the harbor by daylight he had been overwhelmed by New York 's proud defiance of the limits imposed by nature , but now , partly veiled by the mystery of night , the city displayed a feminine beauty at once entrancing and elusive .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 45]: At a cross street he paused for a moment to admire a gem of architecture wrenched bodily from its Cinque Cento setting by Brunelleschi , and transplanted to this new land to serve the opulent need of a vendor of precious stones and metals .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 30]: In the strip of dark blue firmament visible above the admirably proportioned cornice he caught sight of two planets flaming high in the west , and in close juxtaposition .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 19]: Necessity had made him somewhat of an astronomer , and he had studied Chinese astrology as a pastime .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 27]: He recognized these lamps of the empyrean as Mars and Venus , and , up-to-date American though he was , drew comfort from that favoring augury .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 33]: Then , in stepping from the roadway to the sidewalk , he stumbled over a heavy curb , and laughed at the reminder that star-gazing did not reveal pitfalls before unwary feet .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 50]: The incident knocked some of the poetry out of him , and it was a quite normal and level-headed young man who walked into the Central Hotel soon after ten o'clock , and found Detective Steingall 's gaze resting on him contemplatively from the neighborhood of the cigar counter .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 24]: Before rejoining the waiting trio in the office , Steingall was interviewing the youth in charge of the tobacco and current literature department .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 15]: Such story as the boy had to tell was hardly in favor of Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 36]: `` The gentleman came here to buy some stamps , and he and a man who was reading in the café said something to each other in a foreign lingo , '' ran the recital .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 37]: `` No , I do n't think I would recognize French if I heard it -- American is good enough for me -- but there was no argument , nothing in the shape of a quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 13]: The Englishman spoke twice , and the other fellar three times . ''
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 11]: `` Mr. Curtis is an American , '' Steingall explained .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 37]: `` Well , he does n't talk like one , anyhow , '' pronounced young New York -- in this instance , of a pronounced Jewish type -- which is perhaps the most dogmatic juvenility extant .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 4]: Then Curtis entered .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 21]: He glanced around , and seemed to be gratified by the discovery that the hotel had lost its inquisitive crowd .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 43]: He did not realize that every newspaper office in New York was alive with conjecture of which he was the chief figure , and that telegraph and telephone were carrying his name and fame across the length and breadth of the country .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 4]: `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 12]: he said , hailing Steingall affably , `` you here still ?
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 14]: Has anything turned up with regard to those scoundrels and their automobile ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 13]: `` Not a word -- about them , '' said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 10]: The purveyor of cigars and news was positively awe-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 44]: He was aware of Steingall 's repute as the `` man with the microscopic eye , '' and he fully expected that the `` sleuth 's '' penetrating organ had already discerned the word `` murderer '' branded on Curtis 's shirt front .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 12]: `` What time will you want me in the morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 12]: went on Curtis , looking in the direction of the office .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 42]: He was really thinking about the mislaid key ; not for an instant did he imagine that by that simple gesture he had almost eradicated from Steingall 's mind the germ of doubt which events had certainly conspired to plant there .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 13]: `` I want you now , '' came the somewhat startling answer .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 6]: `` Eh , why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 11]: `` Some friends of yours are anxious to see you .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 30]: They are in the private office over there , '' and Steingall thrust out his chin in the indicative manner which the Romans used to call _ annuens _ .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 9]: `` Oh , Howard Devar , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 5]: But who else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 7]: `` Come along , Mr. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 67]: You can stand a pleasant surprise , I am sure , '' and , with that , the detective led the way across the hall , leaving the youthful Jew in a maze of conflicting emotions , for , according to all the rules of the game as played in the dime novel , the tec ' should have sprung on his prey like a tiger .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 12]: Another person whose nervous system received a shock was the super-clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 40]: He , like the boy , knew of the network of suspicion which had closed on Curtis during the past two hours , and he had watched the cordial meeting between the two men with something akin to stupefaction .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 32]: But neither of these onlookers had grasped the really essential fact that Steingall did not say one word as to the hue and cry which resulted from Curtis 's strange disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 11]: The detective was a master of the art of restraint .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 22]: In his own way , he applied to his profession the maxim of Horace -- _ Ars est celare artem _ .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 32]: And he had his reward in that cry of dismay , almost of horror , which burst from Curtis 's lips when he heard the true name of the murdered man .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 45]: Uncle Horace 's seemingly maladroit interruption -LRB- it raised him to a pinnacle of esteem in Devar 's mind from which he was never dislodged subsequently -RRB- prevented any striking development until a glad-eyed waiter had entered and taken an order for four highballs .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 21]: Even Mrs. Curtis admitted the need of a stimulant , but Curtis steadily refused any intoxicant , even the mildest .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 6]: Steingall endured the delay stoically .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 21]: He actually held back a sufficient time to allow Horace P. Curtis to empty his glass with one well-sustained effort .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 10]: Then he came to close quarters with Napoleonic directness .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 22]: `` I take it you assumed that the dead man was the Jean de Courtois mentioned in the marriage license ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 24]: He gave that question pride of place in pursuance of a queer thought which had leaped into his brain during the enforced interval .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 48]: But , if he had been thinking hard , so had Curtis , and the latter had outlined a plan of action which was fated to disrupt Steingall 's , much as a harmless looking percussion cap may interfere with the smug torpor of a powder magazine .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' said Curtis , with the judicial nod of a man who states a comparatively obvious fact .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 7]: `` Have you that license ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 6]: `` Where is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 31]: `` Reposing in the writing-desk of the Rev. Thomas J. Hughes , a minister of the Protestant Episcopal Church , who lives in 56th Street , near Seventh Avenue . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 11]: `` And what is it doing there , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 5]: `` I used it .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 8]: I have married Lady Hermione Grandison . ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 14]: Steingall permitted himself the rare luxury of a semi-hysterical break in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 12]: `` Is she the daughter of the Earl of Valletort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 20]: `` Precisely , though you astonish me by the ease with which you connect two such widely different names .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 17]: Such knowledge usually implies a close acquaintance with the amiable foibles of the British aristocracy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 21]: Certainly it was well that Mrs. Horace P. Curtis had partaken of a tonic in the shape of a highball .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 44]: For once she was practically speechless , but she gave the astounded Devar a pitiless glance which said plainly : `` Wait till I get my breath , young man , and I 'll take some of the cocksureness out of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 7]: Steingall soon gathered his scattered wits .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 11]: `` Are you really speaking seriously , Mr. Curtis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 5]: `` Quite seriously . ''
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 9]: `` Was this marriage an arranged affair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 7]: The marriage itself was prearranged . ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 10]: `` Candidly , I do n't understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 3]: `` No ?
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 5]: I am not surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 19]: But I do not wish you to remain under any misapprehension as to the true state of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 14]: Lady Hermione Grandison meant to marry a French music-master named Jean de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 47]: I thought , thought honestly but mistakenly , that the man was dead , and , as it was of vital importance that her ladyship should get married to-night , I offered my services as Jean de Courtois ' substitute , and they were accepted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 12]: `` Am I to take that statement as literally true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 4]: `` Absolutely . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 11]: `` You were not acquainted with the lady earlier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 9]: `` Never seen or heard of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 17]: `` How did you come to engage in this -- this freak marriage , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 8]: Curtis measured Steingall with a contemplative eye .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 26]: `` You are called on to assimilate a novel idea , and , in consequence , are choosing your words badly , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 8]: `` It was not a freak marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 54]: Although I may have broken the laws of the State of New York by using a license issued to some other person , Lady Hermione and I are legally husband and wife , and no power on earth can dissolve the union without the expressed consent of one or both of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 57]: `` Do you mean me to accept the bald theory that you first learnt the lady 's name and address from a document discovered in another man 's overcoat , that you went to her house , told her the man was dead , and suggested that you should become the bridegroom in his stead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 14]: `` As an adjective , ` bald ' is -- well , bald .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 12]: But you 've got the affair sized up accurately otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 8]: `` Oh , the shameless hussy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 6]: broke in Mrs. Horace vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 11]: Steingall turned on her with a certain heat of manner .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 14]: `` Do not interrupt , madam , I beg , '' he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 18]: `` Better reserve judgment , aunt , until you have met my wife , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 5]: He spoke gently enough .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 51]: He had appraised his relatives almost at a glance , and was sufficiently broad-minded to allow for the natural distress of a respectable middle-aged lady who had been whirled , as it were , out of her wonted environment , and rapt into the realms of necromancy and Arabian Nights .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 14]: Steingall swept aside this intermission with the emphatic hand of a cross-examining lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 18]: `` You say it was ` of vital importance that the lady should be married to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 6]: What does that imply ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 13]: `` Do you wish me to put it in different language ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 12]: `` I want to know what the vitally important reason was .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 7]: I presume she furnished one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 17]: `` Ah , but how does that concern the New York police , Mr. Steingall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 9]: `` Every element in this business concerns us .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 18]: The license was in Hunter 's possession -- was he bringing it to someone named de Courtois ?
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 9]: Or was he masquerading under an alias ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 10]: `` Answering your second question , I imagine not .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 14]: I have the best of reasons for believing that Jean de Courtois exists .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 7]: I wish now I had n't .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 16]: Do n't you see , Steingall , I am in a deuce of a fix ?
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 8]: I married the lady under a misapprehension .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 12]: She might have really preferred this fellow , de Courtois . ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 71]: Steingall liked a joke as well as any man in New York , and was not at all averse from chaffing some of his less gifted colleagues when their obtuseness or faithful adherence to the letter of instructions permitted a criminal to befool them ; but he resented the levity of Curtis 's tone now , though , deep in his heart , he felt that he liked the man .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 25]: `` You do n't seem to realize the peculiarly awkward position in which you stand , '' he said , with due official gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 10]: `` On the contrary , I feel it acutely .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 11]: What am I to say to my wife -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 20]: `` I am not wrung with agony over the lady 's sensitiveness , '' broke in the detective dryly .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 14]: `` A good many people believe that you were concerned in this murder .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 11]: There are not lacking circumstantial details which warrant that view .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 24]: I am not saying too much when I tell you that some men , in my shoes , would arrest you forthwith . ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 17]: Curtis looked at Steingall quizzically , and even laughed with a whole-hearted appreciation of the jest .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 19]: `` Lucky for me I have fallen into the hands of a sensible person , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 34]: `` Allow me to remark , '' put in Uncle Horace solemnly , `` that Mr. Steingall has won my unstinted admiration by the way in which he has conducted this inquiry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 7]: Devar was beginning to enjoy himself .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 32]: He alone was able to estimate Curtis at his true worth ; even that astounding marriage was losing some of its bizarre attributes since Curtis had begun to talk about it .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 15]: `` Good for you , Mr. Curtis , senior , '' he crowed delightedly .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 16]: `` If Indiana knew what it really wanted it would run you for Governor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 5]: Steingall nearly became angry .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 25]: Indeed , it is probable that he would have expressed his sentiments in strong language were it not for the presence of Mrs. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 24]: `` Now , sir , '' he said , with a perceptible stiffening of manner , `` let us have done with pretense .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 21]: You strike me as being sane , yet you ask me to believe that you have acted like a lunatic .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 8]: Well , let it go at that .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 18]: Who is this Jean de Courtois , whom Lady Hermione Grandison was to have married to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 39]: `` My wife tells me that he is a French music-master whom she hired to marry her in order that she might escape from a pestiferous person named Count Ladislas Vassilan , '' replied Curtis with cool directness .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 27]: `` She brought the obliging individual with her from Paris for the purpose , and paid him a thousand dollars as a sort of retaining fee .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 35]: From what little I have seen of her , she impresses me as a charming girl wholly without experience of a world which , though not altogether wicked , is nevertheless callous and self-seeking .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 23]: Among other drawbacks , she embarked on a fantastic project with a most disingenuous belief in the good faith of a Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 51]: Now , I admire France as a nation , but where women are concerned , I distrust Frenchmen as a race , and I suspect -- mind you , I am merely guessing -- but I repeat that I suspect the honesty of Monsieur Jean de Courtois in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 60]: There was no earthly reason why he should not have married Lady Hermione some weeks ago , but it is clear that he has used every artifice to delay the ceremony until to-night -- and , it may be found when we learn the facts , was prepared to put it off once more till to-morrow or next day .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 12]: In my opinion , the reason is not far to seek .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 20]: The Earl of Valletort and Count Ladislas Vassilan were crossing the Atlantic hot in pursuit of the unwilling bride .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 37]: They arrived in New York to-night , and were so well posted in events , both past and prospective , that they headed straight for the flat in which Lady Hermione was living with her maid .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 70]: Naturally , I am keenly interested in the causes which led up to a peculiarly brutal and uncalled-for murder , and , as my wife 's husband , I have the further incentive of hoping to bring to justice certain of her persecutors whom I can not help connecting indirectly with the crime of which I was , I suppose , one of the most credible and intelligent witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 45]: Now , before I was aware that such a winsome creature existed as the present Lady Hermione Curtis , I had estimated the murderers as Hungarians , two of them at any rate , since I am hardly prepared to vouch for the chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 7]: Count Ladislas Vassilan is a Hungarian .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 21]: The poor fellow who was killed , though his name is American enough , spoke French with a pure accent .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 11]: One of the Hungarians spoke French , fluently but vilely .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 8]: Jean de Courtois is admittedly a Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 45]: I am not a detective , Mr. Steingall , but as a plain man of affairs I am forced to the conclusion that there has seldom been a similarly mysterious crime in which certain lines of inquiry thrust themselves more pertinently on the imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 42]: To sum up , I advise you to find Jean de Courtois -- unless , indeed , he , too , has been killed -- and you will be in close touch with the origin of the whole ugly business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 5]: `` Good egg ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 5]: cried the irresistible Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 48]: `` It 's a pity you were not with us on the _ Lusitania _ , Mr. Steingall , or you would realize that when John D. rears up on his hind legs , and talks like that , there is nothing more to be said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 9]: `` Is Lady Hermione a pretty girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 5]: demanded Mrs. Curtis eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 23]: Her democratic soul was rejoicing in the discovery that her nephew 's wife did not lose her title because of the marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 39]: Of course , no one ever before heard of such folly as this matrimonial leap in the dark , but , once taken , there was satisfaction in the thought that the bride was an earl 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 25]: Moreover , she had read of such queer goings on among the British Aristocracy that a wedding at sight was a comparatively venial offense .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 31]: Curtis assured his aunt that Hermione was the most beautiful and fascinating person he had ever met , and Steingall listened to the eulogy with a grinning rictus of jaw .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 25]: In the whole course of his professional experience he had never encountered anything on a par with this capricious blend of comedy and tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 30]: Of course , it did not escape his acute brain that Curtis was right in assuming that the _ clou _ of the situation lay with Jean de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 14]: Dead or alive , the Frenchman must be found , and found quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 38]: The extraordinary story told by Curtis , if true -- and the detective was persuaded that this curiously constituted young man was not trying to hoodwink him in any particular -- pointed a ready way toward investigation .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 20]: The unfortunate journalist , Hunter , was about to enter the Central Hotel when he was attacked so mercilessly .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 20]: As a consequence , some knowledge of de Courtois was probably awaiting the first questioner at the inquiry counter .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 29]: What a whimsical incongruity it would be if he were told that the French music-master around whom the inquiry pivoted was within arm 's length all the time !
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 22]: He had actually turned to the door in order to summon the hotel clerk when that worthy himself knocked and entered .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 24]: `` The Earl of Valletort is here , and wishes to have a word with you , Mr. Steingall , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 56]: The detective 's present grim conceit ran somewhat to the effect that if he remained long enough in the Central Hotel he would accumulate sufficient evidence to electrocute three criminals , at least , and send others to the penitentiary , but he merely nodded and said : `` Show his lordship right in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 18]: He was conscious of a dramatic pause in the conversation which had broken out between the others .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 16]: Once again had Mrs. Curtis been rendered dumb by the shock of an unforeseen development .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 85]: Devar , who was having the night of his life , leaned back against the wainscot , Uncle Horace peered hopelessly into an empty tumbler , but dared not suggest a second highball , while Curtis , after one sharp glance at the detective , whom he credited with having arranged this surprise in some inexplicable way , thrust his hands into his trousers ' pockets and awaited the advent of Hermione 's father with a calmness that he himself could hardly account for .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 23]: Hitherto , his adventurous life had been made up of strenuous effort tempered by the Anglo-Saxon phlegm which disregards dangers and difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 11]: Prolonged strain of an emotional nature was new to him .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 51]: He understood , but did not apply the knowledge , that when the human vessel is full to the brim with excitement , the earth may rock and the heavens roll together in fury without the power to add one more drop of gall or distress to the completed measure .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 29]: At that instant , if the Earl of Valletort had been accompanied by the embodied ghosts of his ancestors , Curtis would have viewed the procession with unconcern .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 39]: The Earl , a handsome slightly built , erect man of fifty , hawk-nosed , keen-eyed , with drooping mustache and carefully arranged thin gray hair , glanced at Curtis as he might have regarded any other stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 75]: `` I have disposed of my friend , '' he said to Steingall , `` and I hurried back here on off-chance that you might still be engaged in -- '' `` Before your lordship enters into details , allow me to introduce Mr. John D. Curtis , '' said Steingall , silently thanking the fates which had brought about a meeting so opportune to his own task if embarrassing to its chief actors .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 22]: `` Mr. John D. Curtis , the -- the person who conspired with my daughter to contract an illegal marriage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 13]: barked the Earl , instantly dropping the repose of Vere de Vere .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 14]: `` John Delancy Curtis , at any rate , '' said Curtis gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 31]: `` As your son-in-law , may I remark that a few minutes ' conversation with a lawyer will enable you to correct two misstatements in the rest of your description ?
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 13]: There was no conspiracy , and the ceremony was unquestionably legal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 17]: The Earl gave him one searching and envenomed look , and appealed forthwith to the detective .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 22]: `` I charge that man with abduction and personation , '' he cried , and his voice grew husky with wrath .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 9]: `` There can be no gainsaying the facts .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 18]: My daughter , it is true , had arranged a marriage with a Monsieur Jean de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 52]: It was provisionally fixed to take place this evening at eight o'clock , but , by some means not known to me , the marriage license came into the hands of this admitted law-breaker , and he evidently persuaded a foolish and impetuous girl to accept him instead of de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 40]: I am not an authority on the laws of the State of New York , but I stake my reputation on the belief that a flagrant offense has been committed against the social ordinances of any well regulated community .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 26]: I now call on you to arrest him , or , if official process is needed , to direct me to the proper authority . ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 10]: `` Have you any proof of the charge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 21]: said Steingall , who had not failed to observe Curtis 's air of unconcern under the Earl 's fiery denunciation .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 11]: `` Proof in plenty , '' came the snarling answer .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 21]: `` I have seen the license and the signed register , and Monsieur de Courtois is known to me personally .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 12]: Besides , have you not this rascal 's own admission ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 11]: `` Why omit the equally damning evidence of conspiracy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 3]: demanded Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 14]: `` What do you mean , you , you -- '' `` Interloper .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 5]: How will that serve ?
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 22]: It was you who spoke of conspiring , though I grant you seem to have dropped that item of the indictment .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 17]: But Mr. Steingall , as representing the law , should hear the full tale of villainy .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 40]: If your lordship will produce de Courtois 's letters , cablegrams , and wireless messages to yourself and your confederate , Count Ladislas Vassilan , he will begin to appreciate the true bearing of a rather intricate inquiry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 11]: It was a chance shot , but it went home .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 54]: Curtis had not spent ten years in counteracting Manchu scheming and duplicity without arriving at certain basic principles in laying bare the methods of double-dealing , and the Earl of Valletort was manifestly disturbed by this cold analysis of facts which he imagined were known to an exceedingly limited circle in New York .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 18]: But he had the presence of mind to waive aside Curtis 's allegations as unworthy of discussion .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 13]: `` I address myself to you , '' he said to Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 15]: `` Have I made my request clear , or shall I repeat it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 15]: `` Have you any objection to answering a few questions , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 4]: said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 5]: `` None whatsoever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 13]: `` When did you and Count Vassilan arrive in New York ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 9]: `` At twenty minutes after eight to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 15]: `` How did you ascertain what was happening with regard to your daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 5]: `` By inquiry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 9]: `` Of course , but from whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 11]: `` From the minister who performed an unauthorized ceremony . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 15]: `` How did you know where to go so promptly to secure information ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 14]: `` I was kept informed of my daughter 's movements by agents . ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 6]: `` Who were they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 12]: `` Their names will be given at the right time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 8]: `` The right time is now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 7]: `` You are not a magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 10]: I take it you are a police officer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 11]: `` Your lordship may feel well assured on that point .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 16]: It is exactly because I am a police officer that I press for a reply .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 21]: Your grievance against Mr. John D. Curtis is much more of a matter for a civil than a criminal court .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 22]: I guess he has broken the law , but the machinery for putting it in motion is not under my control .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 34]: I am investigating a murder , and every word you have said confirms my belief that your daughter 's contemplated marriage was the indirect but none the less certain cause of the crime .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 12]: Now , Lord Valletort , who were your inquiry agents ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 4]: muttered Uncle Horace .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 30]: It was a simple enough ejaculation , but it served to drive home the nail which the detective 's outspoken declaration had hammered into the Earl 's startled consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 29]: Here , in truth , was a new and disturbing phase of the matrimonial problem contrived by Hermione , aided and abetted by that mischievous scoundrel , Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 14]: Still , he was not one to be driven easily into a corner .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 38]: `` You practically refer me to a lawyer for advice ; I take you at your word , '' he said , with a quick return to the self-controlled attitude of an experienced man of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 20]: `` You decline , then , to answer the only vitally important question I have put to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 3]: said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 23]: `` I decline to answer that question until I have consulted someone better able -- or shall I say , more willing ?
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 15]: -- to instruct me as to the speediest means of punishing a malefactor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 12]: `` The noble lord is disqualified , '' broke in Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 18]: `` This is the second time since the flag fell that he has refused his fences . ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 22]: `` If you interrupt again I shall turn you out of the room , Mr. Devar , '' cried Steingall vexedly .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 19]: `` But , dash it all , Steingall , somebody must see that John D. has fair play .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 42]: He only swerved once , and then for a single stride , while he -- '' `` I shall not warn you a second time , '' and Devar knew that the detective meant what he said , and kept quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 12]: `` May I ask where the police headquarters are situated ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 14]: said the Earl in the frostiest tone he could command at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 15]: `` At the corner of Center Street and Grand , '' said Steingall indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 41]: He was about to add the unpleasing fact -- unpleasing to Lord Valletort , that is -- that the man on duty at the Detective Bureau would certainly refer an inquirer to him , Steingall , when the clerk reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 31]: `` A patrolman has brought a note for you , '' he said , handing Steingall a sealed letter , which the detective opened instantly after glancing at the superscription .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 22]: It was from the police captain , and ran : `` Count Vassilan has just left the Waldorf-Astoria in a taxi .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 5]: Clancy is driving . ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 37]: Steingall 's face betrayed no more expression than that of the Sphinx , though inwardly he was consumed with laughter ; he himself was chief of the Bureau , and Clancy was his most trusted assistant !
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 17]: Certainly , the gods were contriving a spicy dish for the news-loving inhabitants of New York .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 17]: CHAPTER VIII TEN-THIRTY The Earl of Valletort turned on his heel , and went out abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 47]: Therefore , he missed Steingall 's first words to the hotel clerk , which would have given him furiously to think , while it is reasonable to suppose that he would have paid quite a large sum of money to have heard the clerk 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 23]: For the detective said : `` Do you happen to know anything about a Frenchman , name of Jean de Courtois ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 10]: And the clerk replied : `` Why , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 11]: He 's in his room now , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 8]: `` In his room -- where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 6]: `` Here , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 21]: He came in about 6.30 , took his key and a Marconigram , and has not showed up since . ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 9]: Uncle Horace could withstand the strain no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 10]: `` Would you mind sending the waiter again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 18]: `` If I do n't get a pick-me-up of some sort quickly , I 'll collapse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 20]: Aunt Louisa would dearly have loved to put in a word , but she knew not what to say .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 17]: Life at Bloomington supplied no parallel to the rapidity of existence in New York that evening .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 32]: She was aware of statements being made in language which rang familiarly in her ears , but they had no more coherence in her clogged understanding than the gabble of dementia .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 17]: Steingall was the least surprised of the five people who listened to the clerk 's words .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 35]: The notion that de Courtois might be close at hand had dawned on him already ; still , he was not prepared to hear that the man was actually a resident in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 11]: `` Has Monsieur de Courtois lived here some time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 24]: he asked , not without a sharp glance at Curtis to see how the suspect was taking this new phase in his adventure .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 10]: `` About a month , '' said the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 8]: `` Has he received many visitors ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 7]: `` A few , mostly foreigners .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 14]: A Mr. Hunter called here occasionally , and they dined together last evening .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 11]: I believe Mr. Hunter is connected with the press . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 12]: The clerk wondered why he was being catechized about the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 22]: He had no more notion that de Courtois and Hunter were connected with the tragedy than the man in the moon .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 19]: `` Take me to Monsieur de Courtois 's room , '' Said Steingall , after a momentary pause .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 8]: `` May I come with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 3]: inquired Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 21]: `` I am deeply interested in de Courtois , and I may be able to help you in questioning him .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 6]: I speak French well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 9]: `` So do I , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 9]: `` But , come if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 21]: `` For the love of Heaven , do n't leave me out of this , Steingall , '' pleaded Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 44]: The detective was blessed with a sense of humor ; he realized that the inquiry had long since passed the bounds of official decorum , and its irregularities had proved so illuminative that he was not anxious to check them yet a while .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' he said , `` you 'll do no harm if you keep a still tongue in your head . ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 15]: `` You 'll come back to us , John , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 18]: broke in Mrs. Curtis , desperately contributing the first commonplace remark that occurred to her bemused brain .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 5]: `` Yes , aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 6]: I 'll rejoin you here .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 13]: Shall I have some supper sent in for both of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 22]: `` No , my boy , '' said Uncle Horace , who had revived under the prospect of a long drink .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 18]: `` If any feasting is to be done later it is up to me to arrange it .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 5]: The night is young .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 17]: I hope to have the honor of toasting your wife before I go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 44]: Curtis smiled at that , but made no reply , the moment being inopportune for explanations , but Devar murmured , as they crossed the lobby with Steingall and the clerk : `` That uncle of yours is a peach , John D .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 10]: He points the moral like a Greek chorus . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 16]: `` I fear he will regard me as a hare-brained nephew , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 25]: `` As for my aunt , poor lady , she must think me the most extraordinary human being she has ever set eyes on .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 10]: What puzzles me most is -- '' `` Wow !
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 31]: I know what aunts are capable of , '' broke in Devar rapidly , for he was doubtful now how his friend would regard the publicity he had not desired .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 38]: `` Mrs. Curtis , senior , is thanking her stars at this minute that she will have a chance of paralyzing Bloomington with full details of her nephew 's marriage into the ranks of the British aristocracy .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 29]: The odd thing is that I 'm tickled to death by the notion that I , little Howard , put you in for this night 's gorgeous doings .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 23]: Did n't you wonder why I passed up an introduction to _ my _ aunt and my cousins in the Customs shed ?
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 59]: Man alive , if Mrs. Morgan Apjohn had made your acquaintance to-day she would have insisted on your dining with the family to-night , and at 7.30 P.M. your feet would have been safely tucked under the mahogany in her home on Riverside Drive instead of leading you into the maze you seem to have found so readily .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 11]: All I wanted was an excuse to get away soon .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 3]: Gee whizz !
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 13]: What a fireworks display you 've put up in the meantime ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 19]: `` Fifth , '' said the clerk to the elevator attendant , and the four men shot skyward .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 37]: As each floor above the street level was a replica of the next higher one , Curtis happened to note that the route followed to the Frenchman 's room was similar to that leading to 605 .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 10]: `` What number does Monsieur de Courtois occupy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 8]: `` 505 , '' said the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 9]: `` Then it is directly beneath mine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 11]: He must have heard us breaking open your door . ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 6]: `` I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 4]: Heard what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 33]: `` We committed some minor offenses with regard to your property during your absence , '' said Steingall , `` but they were of slight account as compared with your own extravagances .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 13]: Let me warn you not to say too much before de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 27]: Even taking your version of events , Mr. Curtis , Lord Valletort will probably raise a wasps ' nest about your ears in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 10]: `` But why _ break open _ the door ?
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 12]: Surely , there was a pass key -- '' `` Sh-s-sh !
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 5]: Here we are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 18]: Steingall tapped lightly on a panel of 505 , and the four listened silently for any response .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 27]: None came -- that is , there was nothing which could be recognized as the sound of a voice or of human movement inside the room .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 18]: Nevertheless , they fancied they heard something , and the detective knocked again , somewhat more insistently .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 31]: Now they were intent for the slightest noise behind that closed door , and they caught a subdued groan or whine , followed by the metallic creak of a bed-frame .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 8]: At that instant a chamber-maid hurried up .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 18]: `` I was just going to ` phone the office , '' she said to the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 23]: `` A little while ago I tried to enter that room , but my key would not turn in the lock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 9]: `` Did you hear anyone stirring within ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 4]: asked the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 10]: I knocked , and there was no answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 7]: `` Listen now , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 39]: A third time did Steingall rap on the door , and the strange whine was repeated , while there could be no question that a bed was being dragged or shoved to and fro on a carpeted floor .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 5]: `` My land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 8]: whispered the girl in an awed tone .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 9]: `` There 's something wrong in there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 12]: `` Let me try your key , '' said the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 13]: He rattled the master-key in the keyhole , but with no avail .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 13]: `` I suppose it acts all right in every other lock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 7]: `` Oh , yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 10]: I 've been using it all the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 16]: `` Someone has tampered with the lock from the outside , '' he said savagely .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 13]: `` There is nothing for it but to send for the engineer .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 18]: Before we 're through with this business we 'll pull the d -- d hotel to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 18]: A nice reputation the place will get if all this door-forcing appears in the papers to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 8]: Certainly the clerk was to be pitied .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 13]: Never before had the decorum of the Central Hotel been so outraged .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 10]: Its air of smug respectability seemed to have vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 32]: Even to the clerk 's own disturbed imagination the establishment had suddenly grown raffish , and its dingy paint and drab upholstery resembled the make-up and cloak of a scowling tragedian .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 6]: A strong-armed workman came joyously .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 46]: He had already figured as a personage below stairs , because of his earlier experiences , and it was a cheering thing to be called on twice in one night to participate in a mystery which was undoubtedly connected with the murder in the street .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 30]: Before adopting more strenuous methods he inserted a piece of strong wire into the keyhole , thinking to pick the lock by that means ; but he soon desisted .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 15]: `` Some joker has been at that game before me , '' he announced .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 17]: `` A chunk of wire has been forced in there after the door was locked . ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 6]: `` From the outside ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 3]: inquired Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 10]: These locks work by a key only from without .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 12]: There is a handle inside ... Well , here goes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 23]: A few blows with a sharp chisel soon cut away sufficient of the frame to allow the door to be forced open .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 39]: On this occasion , there being no wedge in the center , it was not necessary to attack the hinges , and , once the lock was freed , the door swung back readily into the interior darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 28]: The engineer , remembering his needless alarm at falling head foremost into Curtis 's room , went forward boldly enough now , and paid for his temerity .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 68]: He was so anxious to be the first to discover whatever horror existed there that he made for the center of the apartment without waiting to turn on the light , and , as a consequence , when he stumbled over something which he knew was a human body , and was greeted with a subdued though savage whine , he was even more frightened than before .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 31]: But no one was concerned about him or his feelings when Steingall touched an electric switch and revealed a bound and gagged man fastened to a leg of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 22]: At first , owing to the extraordinary posture of the body , it was feared that another tragedy had been enacted .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 39]: The victim of an uncanny outrage was lying on his side , and his arms and legs were roughly but skillfully tied with a stout rope in such wise that he resembled a fowl trussed for the oven .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 48]: After securing him in this fashion , his assailants had fastened the ends of the rope to the iron frame of the bed , and his only possible movement was an ignominious half roll , back and forth , in a space of less than eight inches .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 42]: This maneuver he had evidently been engaged in as soon as he heard voices and knocking outside , but he had been gagged with such brutal efficacy that his sole effort at speech was a species of whinny through his nose .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 31]: The detective 's knife speedily liberated him ; when he was lifted from the floor and laid gently on the bed , he remained there , quite speechless and overcome .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 41]: Steingall turned to the agitated chambermaid , whose eyes were round with terror , and who would certainly have alarmed the hotel with her screams had she come upon the occupant of the room in the course of her rounds .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 28]: `` Bring a glass of hot milk , as quickly as you can , '' he said , and the girl sped away to the service telephone .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 8]: `` Would n't brandy be better ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 3]: inquired Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 12]: Milk is the most soothing liquid in a case like this .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 9]: The man 's jaws are sore and aching .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 14]: Probably , too , he is faint from fright and want of food .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 25]: If we can get him to sip some milk he will be able to tell us , perhaps , just what has happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 23]: While they awaited the return of the chamber-maid , the party of rescuers gazed curiously at the prostrate figure on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 29]: They saw a small , slight , neatly built man , attired in evening dress , whose sallow face was in harmony with a shock of black hair .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 29]: A large and somewhat vicious mouth was partly concealed by a heavy black mustache , and the long-fingered , nervous hands were sure tokens of the artistic temperament .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 16]: There could be no manner of doubt that this hapless individual was Jean de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 32]: He looked exactly what he was , a French musician , while initials on his boxes , and a number of letters on the dressing-table , all testified to his identity .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 24]: Curtis , Devar , and the hotel clerk seemed to be more interested in the appearance of the half-insensible de Courtois than Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 64]: He gave him one penetrating glance , and would have known the man again after ten years had they been parted that instant ; but , if he favored the Frenchman with scant attention , he made no scruples about examining the documents on the table , though his first care was to thank the workman , and send him from the room .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 27]: `` Now , '' he muttered to the others in a low tone , `` leave the questioning to me , and mention no names . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 14]: He picked up a Marconigram lying among the letters , and read it .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 15]: Without a word , but smiling slightly , he handed it unobtrusively to Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 24]: It bore that day 's date , and the decoded time of delivery was 4 P.M. `` Arriving to-night , '' it ran .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 6]: `` Coming direct Fifty-Ninth Street .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 7]: Expect us there about eight-thirty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 5]: Curtis smiled , too .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 8]: He grasped the detective 's unspoken thought .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 37]: Steingall had as good as said that the message bore out Curtis 's counter charge against Count Vassilan and the Earl of Valletort of conspiring with de Courtois himself to defeat Lady Hermione 's marriage project .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 34]: Indeed , before replacing the slip of paper on the table , the detective produced a note-book , and entered therein particulars which would secure proof of the Marconigram 's origin if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 34]: The maid hurried in with the milk , and Steingall , why had covered more ground among the Frenchman 's correspondence than the others gave him credit for , now acted as nurse .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 26]: With some difficulty he succeeded in persuading the stricken man on the bed to relax his firmly closed jaws and endeavor to swallow the fluid .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 29]: It was a tedious business , but progress became more rapid when de Courtois realized that he was in the hands of those who meant well by him .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 35]: It was noticeable , too , as his senses returned and the panic glare left his eyes , that his expression changed from one of abject fear to a lowering look of suspicious uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 21]: He peered at Steingall and the hotel clerk many times , but gave Curtis and Devar only a perfunctory glance .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 54]: Oddly enough , the fact that the two latter were in evening dress seemed to reassure him , and it became evident later that the presence of the clerk led him to regard these strangers as guests in the hotel who had been attracted to his room by the mere accident of propinquity .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 19]: His first intelligible words , uttered in broken English , were : `` Vat time ees eet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 8]: `` Ten-thirty , '' said Steingall . ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 9]: _ Ah , cré nom d'un nom _ !
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 8]: I haf to go , queek ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 5]: `` Where to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 4]: `` No mattaire .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 6]: I tank you all to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 5]: I explain eferyting den .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 6]: Now , I go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 19]: `` You had better stay where you are , Monsieur de Courtois , '' said Steingall in French .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 9]: `` Milord Valletort and Count Vassilan have arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 18]: I have seen them , and nothing more can be done with respect to their affair tonight .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 33]: I am the chief of the New York Detective Bureau , and I want you to tell me how you came to be in the state in which you were found . ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 32]: But de Courtois was regaining his wits rapidly , and the clarifying of his senses rendered him obviously unwilling to give any information as to the cause of his own plight .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 6]: Nor would he speak French .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 24]: For some reason , probably because of a permissible vagueness in statements couched in a foreign tongue , he insisted on using English .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 17]: `` Eef you haf seen my frien 's you tell me vare I fin ' dem .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 17]: I come your office to-morrow , an ' make ze complete explanation , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 14]: `` I must trouble you to-night , please , '' insisted Steingall quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 15]: `` You do n't understand what has occurred while you were fastened up here .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 8]: You know Mr. Henry R. Hunter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 5]: I know heem . ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 30]: `` Well , he was stabbed while alighting from an automobile outside this hotel shortly before eight o'clock , and I imagine he was coming to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 3]: `` Stabbed !
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 6]: Did zey keel heem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 11]: Now , tell me who ` they ' were . ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 11]: Monsieur Jean de Courtois was taken instantly and violently ill .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 33]: He dropped back on the bed , from which he had risen valiantly in his eagerness to be stirring , and faintly proclaimed his inability to grasp what the detective was saying .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 9]: `` Ah , _ Grand Dieu _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 9]: `` I am eel ; fetch a doctaire .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 15]: My brain , eet ees , vat you say , _ étourdi _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 9]: `` You will soon recover from your illness .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 31]: Come , now , pull yourself together , and tell me who the men were who tied you up , and why , if you can give a reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 9]: The Frenchman shut his eyes , and groaned .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 15]: `` I am stranjare here , Monsieur le Commissaire , '' he said brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 8]: `` I know no ones , nodings .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 8]: Milor ' Valletort , he ees acquaint .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 10]: Send for heem , and bring ze doctaire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 33]: `` Do n't you understand that your friend , Mr. Hunter , the journalist who was helping you in the matter of Lady Hermione Grandison 's marriage , has been murdered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 15]: The other men in the room caught a new quality in Steingall 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 60]: Contempt , disgust , utter disdain of a type of rascal whom he would prefer to deal with most fittingly by kicking him , were revealed in each syllable ; but Jean de Courtois was apparently deaf to the mean opinion his conduct was inducing among those who had extricated him from a disagreeable if not actually dangerous predicament .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 28]: He squirmed convulsively , and half sobbed his inability to realize the true nature of anything that had happened either to himself or to any other person .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 33]: `` Very well , '' said the detective , `` if you are so thoroughly knocked out I 'll see that you are kept quiet for the rest of the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 6]: He turned to the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 13]: `` Kindly arrange that two trustworthy men shall undress this ill-used gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 47]: He may be given anything to eat or drink that he requires , but if he shows signs of delirium , such as a desire to go out , or write letters , or use the telephone , he must be stopped , forcibly if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 12]: Should he become violent , ring up the nearest police station-house .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 13]: I 'll send a doctor to him in a few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 12]: De Courtois revived slightly under the stimulus of these emphatic directions .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 12]: `` I haf not done ze wrong , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 19]: `` Eet ees me who suffare , and I do not permeet dis interference wid my leebairty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 9]: `` You see , '' said Steingall coolly .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 7]: `` His mind is wandering already .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 19]: Just ` phone for a couple of attendants , will you , and I 'll give them instructions .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 9]: I take full responsibility , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 10]: `` But , monsieur -- '' cried the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 9]: `` Would you mind getting a move on ?
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 14]: I am losing time here , '' said Steingall quietly to the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 14]: `` I claim ze protection of my consul , '' sputtered de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 4]: `` Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 21]: He is quite light-headed , '' said the detective sympathetically , addressing the company at large but speaking in French .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 15]: `` I do hope most sincerely that I may arrest those infernal Hungarians to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 19]: Not only did they kill Hunter but they have brought this little man to death 's door . ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 11]: The effect of these few harmless sounding words was electrical .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 22]: Monsieur de Courtois ' angry demeanor suddenly changed to that of a sufferer almost as seriously injured as Steingall made out .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 34]: He collapsed utterly , and never lifted his head even when most drastic measures were enjoined on a couple of sturdy negroes as to the care that must be devoted to the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 16]: Steingall was astonishingly outspoken to Curtis and Devar while they were walking to the elevator .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 17]: `` I am surprised that that miserable whelp escaped with his life , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 26]: `` Usually , in cases of this sort , the rascal who betrays his friends receives short shrift from those who make use of him .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 26]: He knows too much for their safety , and gets a knife between his ribs as soon as his services cease to be valuable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 21]: `` I must confess that I do n't begin to grasp the bearings of this affair , '' admitted Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 46]: `` It is almost grotesque to imagine that a number of men could be found in New York who would stop short of no crime , however daring , simply to prevent a young lady from marrying in despite of her father 's wishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 21]: `` Of course , the young lady figures large in your eyes , '' said Steingall with a dry laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 12]: `` You have n't thought this matter out , Mr. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 47]: When you have slept on it , and the fact dawns on you that there are other people in the world than the charming Lady Hermione , you will realize that she is a mere pawn around whom a number of very important persons are contending .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 69]: I do n't wish to say a word to depreciate her as a star of the first magnitude , but I am greatly mistaken if there is not another woman , either here or in Europe , whose personality , if known , would attract far more attention from the police ... By the way , has it occurred to you that Providence has certainly befriended you to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 33]: The dare-devils who murdered Hunter were inclined to kill you in error ... Now , I want you to concentrate your mind on the face and expression of that chauffeur , Anatole .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 7]: Keep him constantly in your thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 28]: If you can swear to him when we parade him before you with half-a-dozen other men , I shall soon strip the inquiry of its mystery . ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 19]: In the hall they were surrounded by a squad of reporters , and three photographers took flashlight pictures .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 4]: `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 12]: muttered the detective to Curtis , `` they 've found you !
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 14]: Now we must use our brains to get you out of this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 14]: They escaped the journalists by closing the door of the office on them .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 22]: Then the clerk was summoned , and solved the first difficulty by revealing a back-stairs exit by way of the basement .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 34]: An attendant was sent to Curtis 's room , to pack a grip with some clothes and linen , and , by adroit maneuvering , the whole party got away from the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 9]: Steingall insisted on interviewing Lady Hermione that night .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 43]: He pointed out , reasonably enough , that she might possess a good deal of valuable information concerning Count Ladislas Vassilan ; if , as Curtis believed was the case , she had already retired to rest , she must be aroused .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 24]: The hour was not so late , and Vassilan 's movements in New York might be elucidated by knowledge of his previous career .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 36]: So Curtis announced that his bride was installed in the Plaza Hotel , and , while he and Devar escaped through the cellars , Steingall took Uncle Horace and Aunt Louisa boldly through the lobby .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 52]: A taxi was waiting there , and he gave the driver the address of the police headquarters downtown , but re-directed him when they were safe from pursuit , and the three , so oddly assorted as companions , arrived at the Plaza within a minute of the two young men .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 17]: Steingall went straight to the telephone room , and Curtis ascended to his suite of apartments .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 17]: He knocked at Hermione 's door , and her `` Yes , who is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 5]: came with disconcerting speed .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 10]: Evidently , she was far from being asleep yet .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 29]: `` It is I -- dear , '' said Curtis , in whom the mere sense of being near his `` wife '' induced a species of vertigo .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 31]: Indeed , he was horribly nervous , since he could not form the slightest notion as to the manner in which she would receive the latest news of de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 22]: The door was opened without delay , and Hermione appeared , dressed exactly as she was when he bade her farewell .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 20]: `` I am sorry to disturb you , '' he said , `` but it can not be helped .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 10]: Things have been happening since I left you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 19]: Her face blanched , but she tried to smile , though the corners of her mouth drooped piteously .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 8]: `` They are not here already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 16]: she cried , and he had no occasion to ask who `` they '' were .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 16]: `` No , '' he said , with a cheerfulness he was far from feeling .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 16]: `` The fact is I -- I -- have brought some friends to see you .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 33]: That is , some of them will , I hope , be your very good friends -- my uncle and aunt , and young Howard Devar , whom I spoke about earlier .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 14]: There is a detective , too -- a very decent fellow named Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 6]: Shall I bring them here ?
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 15]: It will be pleasanter than being stared at in a crowded supper room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 13]: She was surprised , but the relief in her tone was unmistakable .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 12]: `` I do n't want any supper , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 27]: `` I shall be glad to meet your relatives , of course , though -- '' `` Though you think I might have mentioned them sooner ?
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 19]: Well , the strangest part of the business is that they should be in New York at all .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 20]: I have n't the remotest idea as to why they are here , or how they dropped across me .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 9]: But is n't it a rather fortunate thing ?
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 10]: They may prove useful in a hundred ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 8]: `` Please do n't keep them waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 7]: What does the detective want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 12]: `` Every syllable you can tell him about Count Vassilan . ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 9]: `` I hardly know the man at all .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 8]: I always avoided him in Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 18]: `` You may be astonished by the number of facts you will produce when Steingall questions you .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 21]: And , I had better warn you that my uncle is even now consulting the head-waiter about a wedding feast .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 12]: He has adopted you without reservation on my poor description . ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 34]: His frankly admiring look brought a blush to her cheeks ; but she only laughed a little constrainedly , and murmured that she would try to be as complacent as the occasion demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 19]: Events were certainly in league to lend her wedding night a remarkably close semblance to the real thing .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 35]: And as Curtis descended to the foyer to summon their waiting guests he decided then and there not to mar the festivities by any explanations concerning Jean de Courtois 's second time on earth .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 20]: Steingall had practically settled the question by confining the Frenchman to his room for the remainder of the night .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 7]: Why interfere with an admirable arrangement ?
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 14]: Let the wretched intriguer be forgotten till the morrow , at any rate !
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 20]: CHAPTER IX ELEVEN O'CLOCK `` In multitude of counselors there is safety , '' says the Book of Proverbs .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 77]: Usually , the philosophy attributed to Solomon exhibits a soundness of judgment which is unrivaled , so it is reasonable to assume that in Hebrew gnomic thought four do not constitute a multitude , because four people agreed with Curtis that there was not the slightest need to mention Jean de Courtois to Hermione that evening , and five people were wrong , though in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred they might have been right .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 64]: Hermione herself admitted afterwards that she would have believed Curtis implicitly had he explained the circumstances which accounted for his undoubted conviction that de Courtois was dead ; indeed , she went so far as to say that , as a matter of choice , she infinitely preferred the American to the Frenchman in the role of a husband _ pro tem _ .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 53]: She had never regarded de Courtois from any other point of view than as her paid ally , and she was beginning to share Curtis 's belief that the man was a double-dealer , a fact which helped to modify her natural regret at the report of his death in her behalf .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 65]: In a calmer mood , too , Curtis would have been quick to realize that a girl who had reposed such supreme confidence in his probity was entitled to share his fullest knowledge of the extraordinary bond which united them , but for one half-hour he was swayed by expediency , and expediency often exercises a disrupting influence on a friendship founded on faith .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 53]: He only meant to spare her the dismay which could hardly fail to manifest itself when she heard that de Courtois was alive , and that additional complications must now arise with reference to the wrongful use of the marriage license ; in reality , he was doing himself a bitter injustice .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 25]: But , having elected for a definite course , he was not a man who would deviate from it by a hair 's breadth .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 40]: When the junta in the vestibule of the Plaza Hotel had promised to remain mute on the topic of de Courtois , he dismissed the matter from his mind as having no further influence on the night 's doings .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 11]: `` Is there any means of recovering my overcoat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 27]: he asked Steingall , remembering the change of garments when a waiter asked if the gentlemen cared to deposit their hats and coats in the cloak-room .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 26]: `` Just empty the pockets of the coat you are wearing , and I 'll send a messenger to the police station-house with a note .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 14]: You wo n't mind if I retain your documents till after the inquest ?
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 27]: One never knows what questions will be asked , and you must remember that an attempt may be made to fasten the crime upon you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 30]: Curtis laughed at the absurdity of any such notion , but , for the first time , he examined the contents of the dead man 's coat pockets methodically .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 11]: The pocket in which the license had reposed was empty .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 8]: Its fellow contained a notebook and pencil .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 27]: There were also some newspaper cuttings -- items of current interest in New York , but devoid of bearing on the crime or its cognate developments .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 43]: An elastic band caused the book to open at a definite page , and Steingall , who knew a little of everything , and a great deal of all matters appertaining to his profession , deciphered some shorthand characters which promised enlightenment .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 37]: He passed no comment , however , but pocketed the book , scribbled a few lines on a sheet of paper bearing the name of the hotel , and intrusted coat and letter to an attendant .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 22]: Uncle Horace , after a momentary qualm , gave instructions to the head-waiter in the approved manner of a trust magnate .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 33]: `` We 're up against it now , Louisa , '' he whispered confidentially to his wife , `` so let 's have one wonderful night if we never have another . ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 7]: Mrs. Curtis nodded her complete agreement .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 37]: She would have sanctioned a mortgage on her home rather than forego any material part of an experience which would command the breathless attention of many a future gathering of matrons and maids in faraway Bloomington .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 15]: Lady Hermione received her visitors with a shy cordiality which won their prompt approval .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 48]: Aunt Louisa had been perplexed by indecision as to what she was to say or how she was to act when she met the bride , but one glance of her keen , motherly eyes at the blushing and timid girl resolved any doubts on both scores .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 9]: `` God bless you , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 15]: she said , throwing her arms around Hermione 's neck and kissing her heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 26]: `` Perhaps everything is for the best , and , anyway , you 've married into a family of honest men and true women . ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 74]: `` Ma'am , '' said Uncle Horace , when his turn came to be introduced , `` strange as it may sound , I know less about my nephew than you yourself , but if he resembles his father in character as he does in appearance , you 've chosen well , and let me add , ma'am , that _ he _ seems to have made a first-rate selection at sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 34]: Of course , such congratulations were woefully misplaced , but Hermione was too well-bred to reveal any cause for disquietude other than the normal embarrassment any young woman would display in like conditions .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 16]: Curtis , too , put in a quiet word which threw light on the situation .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 28]: `` As I told you a few minutes since , I was not aware that my uncle and aunt were in New York , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 49]: `` I can not even guess how they came to find me so opportunely , and we have hardly been able to say a word to each other yet , because they were in the thick of the police inquiry when I met them in my hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 28]: `` Why , that 's the easiest thing , '' declared Aunt Louisa , rejoicing in a long-looked-for opportunity to hear her own voice in full volume .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 83]: `` This young gentleman here , '' and she nodded at the dismayed Devar , `` told us that he cottoned to your husband , my dear , something remarkable on board the steamer , so he sent a message by wireless to the editor of a New York paper , asking him to let America know that one of her citizens who had won distinction in China was homeward bound , and the editor circulated a real nice paragraph about it .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 86]: It quite took my breath away when Mrs. Harvey , our mayor 's wife -- such a charming woman , my dear , and I do hope I may have the pleasure of bringing you to one of her delightful tea-and-bridge afternoons -- said to me on Monday : ` Surely , Mrs. Curtis , this John Delancy Curtis who is on board the _ Lusitania _ must be a son of that brother of your husband who died in China some years ago ? '
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 18]: and I said : ` What in the world are you talking about , Mrs. Harvey ? '
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 213]: so she showed me the newspaper , and I was that taken aback that I revoked in the next hand , and the only mean player we have in the club claimed three tricks ` without , ' and went game , being a woman herself who has n't chick nor child , but devotes far too much time and money to toy dogs ; anyhow , I could n't give my mind to cards any more that day , so off I rushed home and ` phoned Horace , and here we are , after such a flurry as you never would imagine , what between packing in a hurry for the trip east , and missing the steamer 's arrival by nearly an hour , and turning up in the Central Hotel just in time to hear -- '' Then Aunt Louisa , assuredly at no loss for words , but remembering in a hazy way the compact made in the vestibule , found it incumbent on her to break away from the main trend of the narrative , so she concluded : `` Just in time to hear things being said about our nephew which we felt bound to deny , both for his sake and our own . ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 44]: Curtis had favored Devar with a questioning scowl when he learnt how his advent had been heralded in the press , but Devar merely vouchsafed a brazen wink , and in the next breath Hermione herself became his unconscious and most persuasive advocate .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 40]: `` I have been bothering my brains to discover when or where I had seen Mr. Curtis 's name before -- before we met to-night , '' she said , smiling at the ridiculous vagueness of her own phrase .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 5]: `` Now I remember .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 21]: I used to read the newspaper reports about every ship that arrived , and I noticed that identical paragraph . ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 19]: `` Thank you , Lady Hermione , '' cried Devar , crowing inwardly over his friend 's discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 34]: `` John D. will begin to believe soon what I have been telling him during the last half-hour -- that I am the real _ Deus ex machinâ _ of the whole business .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 27]: Why , if it had n't been for me you two would never have got married , and this merry party could n't have happened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 14]: A knock at the door caused Hermione to turn with a startled look .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 21]: Try as she might , she dreaded every such incident as the preliminary to a stormy interview with her father .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 31]: `` Unless I am greatly mistaken , ma'am , '' interposed Uncle Horace blandly , `` this will be a waiter coming to tell us that supper is ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 24]: As usual , he said the correct thing , and Steingall drew Hermione aside while the table was being spread for the feast .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 10]: He lost no time in coming to the point .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 11]: His first demand showed that he took nothing for granted .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 15]: `` I am bound to speak plainly , your ladyship , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 14]: `` Is the remarkable story told by Mr. John D. Curtis true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 6]: `` Regarding the marriage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 4]: said Hermione promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 28]: `` Well , as I do not know what he may have said , you can decide that matter for yourself after you have heard my version .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 97]: I am a fugitive from Paris , where my father was endeavoring to force me into a detestable union : I am practically a complete stranger in New York : I had arranged with Monsieur de Courtois to become my husband , under a clear agreement for money paid that the marriage should serve only as a shield against my pursuers ; he was prevented by some dreadful men from keeping to-night 's appointment , and Mr. Curtis came to me , intending to break the news somewhat more gently than one might look for otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 13]: He heard my sad little explanation , and was sorry for me .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 53]: As it happened , he appreciated the real nature of my predicament , and , having no ties to prevent such a daring step , offered me the protection of his name until such time as I become my own mistress and am free to secure a dissolution of the marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 11]: `` Will you tell me exactly what you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 4]: said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 28]: His voice was kindly , and his expression gravely sympathetic , and Hermione could not read the amused tolerance lurking behind the mask of those keen eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 13]: `` I mean that I am yet what lawyers call an infant .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 30]: In six months I shall be twenty-one , and the coercion which has been used to force me into marrying Count Ladislas Vassilan will be no longer possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 16]: `` Do you forfeit an inheritance by refusing to obey Lord Valletort 's wishes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 12]: `` No , unless with respect to my father 's estate .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 16]: My mother was wealthy , and her money is settled on me most securely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 5]: `` In trust ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 15]: `` Yes , I have trustees , an English banker and a clergyman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 22]: `` But , if they are men of good standing , they ought to have protected you from undue interference . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 23]: `` An earl is of good standing , too , in my country , and Count Vassilan claims royal rank in Hungary .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 20]: I loathe the man , yet every one of my friends and relatives urged me to accept him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 27]: `` Because he has a chance of obtaining a throne when the Austro-Hungarian Empire breaks up , and my wealth will help his cause materially . ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 7]: Steingall allowed himself to appear surprised .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 10]: `` Is your income so large , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 7]: `` Yes , I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 16]: My trustees tell me that I am worth nearly a hundred thousand a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 4]: `` Dollars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 7]: `` No -- pounds sterling . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 35]: They were conversing in subdued tones , yet the detective behaved like a commonplace mortal in giving a rabbit-peep sideways to ascertain if the girl 's astounding statement had been overheard by the others .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 48]: But the members of the Curtis family of honest men and true women had withdrawn purposely to the far side of the room , and Devar was laboring to convince his friend that he had acted wisely in placarding his name and fame throughout the United States .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 25]: `` To your knowledge , Lady Hermione , is any other person in New York aware that you are several times a millionaire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 5]: `` I think not .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 34]: Poor Jean de Courtois may have had some notion of the fact , but I lived so unostentatiously in Paris that he would necessarily be inclined to minimize the amount of my fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 25]: Tell me , Mr. Steingall , do you really think he -- '' The detective shook his head , and laughed with official dryness .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 23]: `` Forgive me , Lady Hermione , '' he said , `` but I must not advance any theories , at present .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 15]: Now , as to Count Vassilan -- how long have you known him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 6]: `` About a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 12]: `` Has he been your suitor practically all that time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 25]: The first day we met I was told by my father that I ought to be proud if he chose me as his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 10]: So I hated him from the very beginning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 12]: `` You took a dislike to him , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 9]: `` Yes , an instant and violent dislike .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 6]: But that is not all .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 28]: There are things I can not mention , though they are the common property of anyone who has mixed in Parisian society during the past twelve months .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 36]: Surely you will be able to find men and women in this great city who can supply enough of Paris gossip to show you clearly what manner of man this Hungarian prince really is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 38]: Hermione 's face showed the distress she felt , and Steingall 's disposition was far too generous to permit of any further probing in this direction when the inquiry gave pain to a young and innocent-minded girl .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 20]: `` To-morrow , '' he said grimly , `` I may read several chapters of Count Vassilan 's life .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 10]: But so much depends on this night 's work .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 27]: At any minute -- certainly within an hour -- I shall have news which may be affected most markedly by some chance hint supplied by you .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 35]: I want you to understand , Lady Hermione , that Mr. Curtis 's share in the queer tangle of the past few hours is not so simple or unimportant as you seem to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 30]: I believe he has been actuated by the best of motives -- '' `` Oh , yes , I am sure of it , '' she broke in eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 26]: `` If I am fated never to see him again after to-night I shall always remember him as a true friend and gallant gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 12]: Steingall bit back the words which rose unbidden to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 74]: He had certainly been wallowing in romance since the telephone called him to the Central Hotel , but even in the pages of fiction he had never found a more wildly improbable theory than the likelihood of John Delancy Curtis allowing any consideration short of death to separate him from such a bride as Lady Hermione within the short space of time she apparently regarded as the possible span of her married life .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 23]: `` Ah , '' he murmured , `` if he is wise he will call you to give evidence in his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 12]: Judges exercise a good deal of latitude in these matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 10]: `` But will he be arrested for marrying me ?
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 24]: If any wrong has been done with respect to the marriage license , I am equally to blame , '' she said loyally .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 4]: Steingall frowned judicially .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 13]: Their conversation was approaching perilously near the forbidden topic of de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 28]: `` In law , as in most affairs of life , it does no good to meet trouble half way , your ladyship , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 29]: `` Now , reverting to the Hungarian prince -- do you remember the names of any persons , of either sex , whom he associated with in Paris ?
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 31]: Of course , such a man would be widely known in what is called society , but I want you to try and recall some of his intimate friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 41]: `` I believe you would find his boon companions in certain cafés on the Grand Boulevard and in the vaudeville theaters on Montmartre ; but would it not help you a little if I told you of his enemies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 5]: `` Most certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 28]: `` Well , I do happen to know that he is hated most cordially by the Countess Marie Zapolya , who lives in the Hotel Ritz . ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 5]: `` In Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 13]: She advised me to shun him as I would the plague . ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 8]: `` Did she give any reason ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 19]: `` It may sound strange , but I really believe she wants him to marry her daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 7]: `` Ah , that is interesting .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 5]: Pray go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 50]: `` I never understood the thing rightly , but I heard once , through a servant , that Count Vassilan was expected to wed Elizabetta Zapolya -- the succession to the Hungarian monarchy , if ever it were revived , was involved -- but Count Vassilan spurned the lady .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 21]: The Countess is furious because her daughter was slighted , yet wishes to compel him to fulfill his obligations . ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 20]: `` In that event , she would be anxious to see you safely married to some other person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 6]: `` Oh , she was .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 27]: She visited me , several times , and advised me not to risk a life-long unhappiness by becoming mixed up in the maze of Mid-Europe politics .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 7]: And -- there is something else .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 25]: Poor Elizabetta Zapolya , who is somewhat older than me , is in love with an attaché at the Austro-Hungarian Embassy in Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 7]: `` Have you his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 6]: Captain Eugene de Karely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 12]: `` How does he stand with regard to Count Vassilan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 33]: `` I am told that he has challenged him repeatedly to a duel , but Count Vassilan can not meet him because they are not equals in the grades of Hungarian aristocracy .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 23]: I am glad that Mr. Curtis did not wait to consult the Almanach de Gotha when _ he _ encountered the wretch .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 10]: Has he told you that he hit him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 11]: `` I have seen the Count , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 28]: The detective was not deaf to the note of alarm in her voice , but the matter must be broached some time , and why not now ?
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 15]: `` At the Central Hotel , about an hour ago , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 8]: `` Was my father with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 18]: The Earl has also had the pleasure of a few minutes ' talk with Mr. Curtis . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: Hermione was open-eyed with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 26]: `` Mr. Curtis has not said a word of this to me , '' she cried , and her louder tone traveled across the room .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 8]: `` Said a word about what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 22]: inquired Curtis , being not unwilling to break in on the conversation , which he thought had lasted quite long enough .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 15]: `` That my father and Count Vassilan had met you at your hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 12]: `` No , not Count Vassilan , '' explained the detective .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 15]: `` He had gone before Mr. Curtis came , but Lord Valletort returned . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 10]: `` Did he ask you where I was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 8]: demanded the girl breathlessly , addressing Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 10]: He tried to have me arrested , and failed .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 16]: I think he looked on me as an unlikely subject to yield unnecessary information . ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 32]: `` Supper is served , sir , '' said a maître d'hôtel to Uncle Horace , and further discussion of Count Vassilan 's tangled matrimonial schemes became difficult for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 33]: Steingall was pressed to join the party -- without prejudice to any official duties he might be called on to perform next day , as Curtis put it pleasantly -- and consented .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 28]: Once again had his instinct been justified , for he was sure that Lady Hermione 's Parisian reminiscences would prove important in some way not yet determinable .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 37]: Moreover , his colleagues knew he was at the Plaza Hotel , and he was content to remain there while his trusted aide , Clancy , was acting as chauffeur during Count Vassilan 's belated excursion .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 105]: The police captain was keeping an eye on the Waldorf-Astoria , a detective was searching the apartment rented by the murdered journalist , and other men of the Bureau were hunting the record of the automobile , though Steingall was convinced that this branch of the inquiry would end in a blind alley , because the car had undoubtedly been stolen , and its lawful owner would only be able to identify it , and declare that , to the best of his belief , it was locked in a garage at the time it was being used for the commission of a crime .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 40]: Steingall assumed that the unfortunate Hunter -- or it might have been de Courtois -- was led to hire this particular vehicle by adroit misrepresentation on the part of some unknown scoundrels who were aware of the contemplated marriage .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 36]: The shorthand notes in Hunter 's book bore out this theory , because they were obviously data supplied by de Courtois which would have enabled the journalist to write a thoroughly sensational story next day .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 45]: He was convinced , when the truth was known , it would be discovered that Hunter made the Frenchman 's acquaintance owing to his habit of mixing with the strange underworld from the Continent of Europe which has its lost legion in New York .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 61]: De Courtois was just the sort of vainglorious little man who would welcome the notoriety of such an adventure as the prevented marriage ceremony , wherein his name would figure with those of distinguished people , and the last thing he counted on was the murder of the scribe who had promised him columns of descriptive matter in the press .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 35]: The pert musician was not the first , nor would he be the last , to find that the role of cat 's - paw is apt to prove more exacting than was anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 92]: To his chagrin , he saw himself changed suddenly from a trusted agent into a dupe , and his utter collapse on hearing of the murder fitted in exactly with the theory taking shape in the detective 's mind -- that there were two implacable forces at war in New York that night , that Lady Hermione 's marriage to Count Vassilan or the Frenchman provided the immediate bone of contention , and that the struggle had been complicated by a too literal interpretation of instructions carried out by bitter partisans .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 22]: In the midst of a lively conversation , the telephone jangled its imperative message from a wall bracket in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 12]: Devar was nearest the instrument , and he answered the call .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 13]: `` It 's for you , Mr. Steingall , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 16]: The detective would have preferred greater privacy , but he rose at once and answered .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 8]: `` And who is Mr. Krantz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 14]: Then , after a pause : `` Oh , yes ... Is he ?
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 10]: ... You need n't trouble at all about that .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 27]: The police surgeon , at my request , has dosed him with sufficient bromide to keep him quiet till to-morrow morning ... Yes , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 18]: Tell them it ca n't be done , and refer them to the Centre-street Bureau ... What ?
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 20]: ... No , so far as I can guess , the engineer wo n't be wanted again to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 55]: He hung up the receiver , and returned to his seat , though he had just been informed that the Earl of Valletort and another person , having ascertained by some means that de Courtois still lived , were raising a commotion at the Central Hotel and demanding access to the Frenchman 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 9]: -LSB- Illustration : Scenes from the photo-drama . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 12]: `` Please , am I mixed up with Mr. Krantz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 29]: inquired Hermione , smiling , for it was a bizarre experience to find herself interested in all sorts and conditions of people whom she had never heard of .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 29]: `` Mr. Krantz is the reception clerk at the Central Hotel , '' was the answer , which conveyed fuller information to other ears than the girl 's .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 7]: Then Steingall glanced at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 19]: `` I think some of you people must be tired after a strenuous day , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 31]: `` I expect to be called away soon , and it is possible that I may want to disturb you , Mr. Curtis , before you retire for the night .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 8]: Do you intend to remain here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 38]: For an instant , an appreciable constraint manifested its presence , and Uncle Horace did not display his wonted tact when he accentuated it by a dry chuckle , _ à propos _ of nothing in particular .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 9]: Curtis relieved the situation after a slight hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 42]: `` Lady Hermione , I take it , will now go to bed , '' he said coolly , `` and , if she is wise , will refuse to unlock her door again till her maid comes in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 19]: I purpose changing my clothes , in case I may have to accompany you on some midnight expedition .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 22]: My uncle and aunt will tell us where they are staying , and arrange to meet us here at lunch to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 17]: You , Devar , being an approved night hawk , will join me in a cigar .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 15]: How is that for a reasonable disposal of the company , Mr. Steingall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 20]: As though in reply , the telephone rang again , and the detective lifted the receiver from its hook .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 3]: `` Hello !
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 6]: That you , Clancy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 3]: `` Right .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 24]: I 'll come along by the subway from 59th Street -- that will be quicker than a taxi ... yes ... yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 22]: He turned , and the five people in the room saw that his face was glowing with the fire of action .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 12]: `` You can defer that change of suits , Mr. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 15]: We must be off at once ... Mr. Devar , have you an automobile ?
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 8]: Can you get hold of it now ?
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 21]: Well , ` phone your chauffeur to be at Centre-street headquarters in as much under half-an-hour as he can manage .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 27]: Taxi-drivers gossip among themselves , so a private car is better ... Excuse the rush , Lady Hermione , and you , too , Mrs. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 9]: I have n't another minute to spare . ''
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 39]: Luckily , Curtis found his overcoat awaiting him in the cloak room , or he might have been in a difficulty , for New York in November is not a city which encourages midnight journeys in evening dress .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 41]: Uncle Horace and Aunt Louisa were hurried into a taxi , and as they were being whisked off to the quiet hotel to which their baggage had been consigned , the stout man began polishing his domed forehead once more .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 19]: `` Lou , '' he said , `` I ca n't make head nor tail of this business .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 4]: Can you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 12]: `` Not yet , Horace , '' was the hopeful response .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 13]: `` But -- what sort of marriage is this , anyway ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 8]: `` Oh , that 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 8]: Those two have n't begun courting yet .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 10]: But it wo n't be long before they start .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 17]: Did you notice -- '' And details observed by Aunt Louisa endured till the taxi stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 45]: CHAPTER X MIDNIGHT After a quick journey by New York 's unrivaled system of rapid transit , the three men alighted at Spring Street , and a couple of minutes ' brisk walk brought them to a large , white-fronted building of severe architecture .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 25]: Above the main entrance two green lamps stared solemnly into the night , and their monitory gleam seemed to bid evildoers `` Beware ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 27]: ; nor was there aught far-fetched in the notion , because from this imposing center New York 's guardians kept watch and ward over the city .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 6]: `` Clancy still waiting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 16]: demanded Steingall of a policeman in uniform who was on duty in an inquiry office .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 25]: He asked me to be on the lookout in case you turned up unexpectedly , as he did n't want to miss you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 84]: The Chief Inspector led his companions straight to the Detective Bureau , taking good care to avoid the room in which the `` covering '' reporters were gathered , because the Police Headquarters of New York , unlike any similar department outside the bounds of the United States , makes the press welcome , and gives details of all arrests , fires , accidents and other occurrences of a noteworthy nature as soon as the facts are telegraphed or telephoned from outlying districts .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 12]: Passing through the general office , Steingall entered his own sanctum .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 24]: A small , slightly built man was bent over a table and scrutinizing a Rogues ' Gallery of photographs in a large album .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 47]: He turned as the door opened , straightened himself , and revealed a wizened face , somewhat of the actor type , its prominent features being an expressive mouth , a thin , hooked nose , and a pair of singularly piercing and deeply sunken eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 11]: `` Hello , Bob , '' he said to Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 26]: Then , without a moment 's hesitation , he added : `` Good-evening , Mr. Curtis -- glad to see you , Mr. Devar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 45]: `` Good-evening , Mr. Clancy , '' said Curtis , not to be outdone in this exchange of compliments , though he could not imagine how a person who had never seen him should not only know his name but apply it so confidently .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 7]: `` May we smoke here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 15]: asked Devar , who had lighted a cigar on emerging from the subway station .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 9]: `` Make yourselves at home in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 6]: I am a hard smoker .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 13]: Let me offer you a good American cigar , Mr. Curtis . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 8]: Perhaps you will try one of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 14]: I bought them in London , but they are of a fair brand .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 8]: You , too , Mr. Clancy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 21]: `` I 'll take one , with pleasure , though I do n't smoke , '' said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 39]: Seeing the question on the faces of both visitors , he cackled , in a queer , high-pitched voice : `` I refuse to poison my gastric juices with nicotine , but I like the smell of tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 28]: Poor old Steingall there has pretty fair eyesight , but his nose would n't sniff brimstone in a volcano , all because he insists on smoking . ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 5]: `` Gastric juice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 3]: laughed Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 8]: `` You do n't possess the article .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 11]: Skin , bones , and tongue are your chief constituents .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 36]: I 'm not surprised you make an occasional hit as a detective , because the average crook would never suspect a funny little gazook like you of being that celebrated sleuth , Eugene Clancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 31]: Clancy 's long , nervous fingers had cracked the wrapper of the cigar given him by Curtis , and he was now passing it to and fro beneath his nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 26]: `` You will observe the difference , gentlemen , between beef and brains , '' he said , nodding derisively at the bulky Chief Inspector .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 23]: `` He rubbers along because he looks like a prize-fighter , and can drive his fist through a three-quarter inch pine plank .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 24]: But we hunt well together , being a unique combination of science and brute force ... By the way , that reminds me .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 18]: If I have got the story right , Count Ladislas Vassilan only landed in New York to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 13]: Did he drive straight to a boxing contest , or what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 11]: `` Wait a second , Clancy , '' interrupted Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 6]: `` Is there anything doing ?
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 7]: How much time have we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 5]: `` Exactly twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 10]: At twelve-thirty I must be in East Broadway . ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 28]: Now , Mr. Curtis , tell Clancy exactly what happened since you put on poor Hunter 's overcoat at the corner of Broadway and 27th Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 17]: Curtis obeyed , though he fancied he had never encountered a more unofficial official than Clancy .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 66]: Shrewd judge of character as he was , he could hardly be expected to guess , after such a momentary glimpse of a man of extraordinary genius in unraveling crime , that Clancy was never more discursive , never more prone to chaff and sneer at his special friend , Steingall , than when hot on the trail of some particularly acute and daring malefactor .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 69]: The Chief of the Bureau , of course , knew by these signs that his trusted _ aide _ had obtained information of a really startling nature , but neither Curtis nor Devar was aware of Clancy 's idiosyncrasies , and some few minutes elapsed before they began to suspect that he had a good deal more up his sleeve than they gave him credit for at first .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 13]: From the outset he took an original view of Curtis 's marriage .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 12]: `` The girl is young and good-looking , you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 5]: was his opening question .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 25]: `` Not yet twenty-one , and remarkably attractive , '' said Curtis , though hardly prepared for the detective 's interest in this direction .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 10]: `` Well educated and lady-like , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 9]: `` Yes , as befits her position . ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 48]: `` Cut out her position , which does n't amount to a row of beans where intellect is concerned ... Well , a man never knows much about a woman anyway , and what little he learns is acquired by a process of rejection after marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 9]: `` May I ask what you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 28]: `` Judging from your history and apparent age , Mr. Curtis , I take it you have not had time to go fooling about after girls ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 10]: `` You are certainly right in that respect . ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 15]: `` Naturally , or you would n't be so ignorant concerning the dear creatures .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 11]: You are to be congratulated , ` pon my soul .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 34]: You will have the rare experience of constructing a divinity out of a wife , whereas the average man begins by choosing a divinity and finds he has only secured a wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 12]: Curtis laughed , but met the detective 's penetrating gaze frankly .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 25]: `` Your bitter philosophy may be sound , Mr. Clancy , '' he said , `` but it is built on a false premiss .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 9]: My marriage is only a matter of form .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 31]: It may be legal -- indeed , I believe it is -- but there can be no dispute as to the nature of the bond between Lady Hermione and myself .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 21]: She regards me as a husband in name only , and will dissolve the tie at her own convenience . ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 11]: `` You 'll place no obstacles in her way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 4]: `` None . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 5]: `` Quite sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 4]: `` Absolutely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 18]: Clancy giggled , as though he were a comedian who had scored a point with his audience .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 25]: `` Then you 're married for keeps , '' he announced , with the grin of a man who has solved a humorous riddle .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 35]: `` By refusing to thwart the lady you throw away your last slender chance of freedom , and you will find her waiting at the gate of the State Penitentiary when you come out .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 11]: By Jove , you 've been pretty rapid , though .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 10]: No wonder people say the East is waking up .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 10]: Are there many more like you in China ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 32]: Curtis was not altogether pleased by this banter , nor did he trouble to conceal his opinion that the New York Detective Bureau was treating a grave crime with scandalous levity .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 24]: `` Whether Lady Hermione married me or Jean de Courtois is a rather immaterial side issue , '' he said , somewhat emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 27]: `` From what little I can grasp of a curiously involved affair , it seems to me that there are weightier interests than ours at stake .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 27]: And , if I may venture to differ from you , a lot of things may happen before I see the inside of a prison . ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 33]: `` After your meteoric career during the past few hours I am inclined to agree with that last remark , '' and Clancy 's tone became so serious that Devar laughed outright .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 9]: `` Do n't misunderstand me , Mr. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 24]: I am lost in admiration of your nerve , but you have told me just what I wanted to make sure of . ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 7]: `` I have expressed no opinions .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 8]: I confined myself to actual facts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 22]: `` And is n't it a highly significant fact that you are over head and ears in love with your wife ?
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 6]: _ Nom d'un pipe _ !
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 13]: Does n't that complicate the thing worse than a Chinese puzzle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 44]: `` I really do n't see -- '' began Curtis , yielding to a feeling of annoyance which was not altogether unwarrantable , but Clancy jerked out his hands as though they were attached to arms moved by the strings of a marionette .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 9]: `` Of course , you do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 6]: `` You 're in love !
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 8]: You 're gorged with the amococcus microbe !
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 11]: It 's the worst case I 've ever heard of .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 46]: I once knew a man who met a girl for the first time at the Park Row end of Brooklyn Bridge and proposed to her before they had crossed the East River , but you 've set up a record that will never be beaten .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 101]: You find a marriage license in the pockets of a murdered man , rush off in a taxi to the address of the lady named therein , marry her , punch a frantic rival on the nose , take the fair one to a hotel , flout her father , a British peer , and hold a banquet at which the Chief of the New York Detective Bureau is an honored guest ; and then you have the hardihood to tell me that your actions constitute an immaterial side issue in the biggest sensation New York has produced this year .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 13]: Young man , wait till the interviewers get hold of you to-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 19]: Wait till the sob sisters begin gushing over your bride -- a pretty one -- with a title !
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 7]: Name of good little gray man !
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 12]: They 'll whoop your side issues into a scare-head front page !
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 76]: Before you know where you are they 'll have you bleating about the color of her eyes , the exquisite curve of her Cupid 's Bow lips , and the way her hair shone when the electric light fell on it , while she , on her part , will be confiding , with a suspicious break in her voice , what a perfectly darling specimen of the American man at his best you are .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 29]: Mr. Curtis , you 're married good and hard , and if you want to cinch the job you ought to go to jail for a while . ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 17]: Unquestionably , the two civilians present thought that Clancy was slightly mad , so Steingall intervened .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 33]: `` Hop off your perch , Eugene , '' he said , `` and tell us how you came to drive Count Vassilan 's taxi , and where you took him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 30]: `` It was a case of intelligent anticipation of forthcoming events , '' said Clancy , whose excitability disappeared instantly , leaving him calm and extremely lucid of speech .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 55]: `` When Evans -LRB- the police captain -RRB- gave me the bearings of the affair -- though , of course , being a creature of handcuffs and bludgeons , he thought our friend Curtis was the real scoundrel -- I realized at once that Vassilan 's indisposition was a bad attack of blue funk .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 27]: Such a man could no more remain quietly in his room at the hotel than a fox terrier could pass a dog fight without taking hold .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 40]: As soon as I saw the Earl go out alone , and heard him direct the taxi to the Central Hotel in 27th Street , I decided that my best place was at the driving wheel of another taxi .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 35]: I picked out a man on the rank who was about my size , and might be mistaken for me in a half-light , and got him to lend me his coat and cap .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 25]: He took mine , and a word to the door-porter fixed things so that I was whistled up quite naturally when his countship appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 38]: He had changed his clothes and linen , but one glance at his nose showed that I had marked my bird , even if the porter had n't given me the mystic sign at the right moment .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 25]: I received my orders , and off we went , a second cab following , with the driver of my taxi as a fare .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 26]: Evidently , the Count was not well posted in New York distances , because he grew restive , and wondered where I was taking him .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 51]: He tried to be artful , too , and when we reached East Broadway he pulled me up at the corner of Market Street , told me to wait , and lodged a five-dollar bill as security , saying I would have annozzaire when we got back to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 7]: Did n't that make things easy ?
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 57]: He plunged into the crowd -- you know what a bunch of Russians , Hungarians , and Polish Jews get together in East Broadway about ten-thirty -- so I rushed to the second cab , swapped coats and hats again , gave the taxi-man the five-spot , and put him in charge of his own cab .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 48]: In less than a minute I overtook the Count , just as he was crossing the street , and saw him enter a house , after saying something to a second-hand clothes man who was bawling out his goods from the open store on the ground floor .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 53]: By the time I had bought two silk handkerchiefs and a pair of boots , and was haggling like mad over a collection of linen collars , size 16 -- a present for you , Steingall -- his nobility came downstairs , but not alone ; there was a girl with him .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 17]: Luckily , she was no Hungarian , but Italian , and they talked in broken English .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 30]: ` They no come-a here-a now-a-time , Excellenza , ' she said , ` but you-a fin ' dem at Morris Siegelman 's restaurant at ` alf-a-pass twelve . '
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 18]: He said something choice -- in pure Magyar , I guess -- and headed for the taxi .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 8]: That is all , or practically all .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 54]: I tried to go back on my bargains with the Israelite in the store , but he made such a row that I paid him , and when I reached the second cab the driver told me that my man nodded as he passed , showing that Vassilan was returning to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 11]: So I came here , and ` phoned you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 9]: Steingall glanced at a clock on the mantel-piece .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 14]: He rose , threw open a door , and switched on a light .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 43]: `` Mr. Curtis , '' he said , `` we must risk something , but I think I can make you up sufficiently to escape recognition , not so much by the Count as by others who may attend that supper party .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 8]: You come , too , Mr. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 7]: There is safety in numbers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 25]: With a deftness that was worthy of a theatrical costumier , the detectives converted themselves and the two young men into ship 's firemen .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 26]: No more effective or simpler disguise could have been devised on the spur of the moment , nor one that might be assumed more readily .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 70]: Boots offered the main difficulty , but Clancy 's purchase fitted Devar , and Curtis made the best of a pair of canvas shoes , while a mixture of grease and coffee extract applied to face and hands changed four respectable looking persons into a gang which would certainly attract the attention of the police anywhere outside the bounds of just such a locality as they were bound for .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 44]: In case the exigencies of the chase separated them , Steingall gave some instructions to the man in the inquiry office , and Devar tested the realism of his appearance by disregarding the chauffeur of the splendidly appointed automobile waiting at the exit .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 21]: Walking up to the car , he opened the door and said gruffly : `` Jump in , boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 15]: The chauffeur wriggled out of his seat instantly , and leaped to the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 14]: `` Here , what the -- '' he began , whereupon Devar laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 12]: `` It 's all right , Arthur , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 6]: `` What 's all right ?
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 15]: This car is here for Mr. Howard Devar , '' cried the man angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 12]: `` Well , you cuckoo , and who am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 43]: Something familiar in the voice caused the chauffeur to look closely at the speaker , whom he had not seen for a considerable time except for a fleeting glimpse on the arrival of the _ Lusitania _ at New York that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 12]: He was perplexed , but was evidently not devoid of humor .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 34]: `` It 's either you or your ghost , sir , '' he said , `` and if it 's your ghost you must have been badly treated in the next world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 17]: A roundsman was entering headquarters at the moment , and gave the quartette a sharp glance .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 17]: `` Here , Parker , '' said Steingall , `` tell this man my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 13]: The policeman came up , looked at the detective , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 38]: `` This is Mr. Steingall , chief of the Detective Bureau , '' he said to the bewildered driver , who resumed charge of the car without further ado , but nevertheless remained uneasy in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 5]: And not without cause .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 27]: He , poor fellow , all unconsciously , was now gathered into the net which had spread its meshes so wide in New York that night .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 59]: He could not understand why his employer 's son should be gallivanting around the city in company with such questionable looking characters , even though one of them might be the famous `` man with the microscopic eye , '' but he was far from realizing that he and his car would help to make history before morning .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 25]: In obedience to orders , he ran along Grand Street , and halted the car on the south side of W. H. Seward Park .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 35]: `` Remain here , if we do not return earlier , till one o'clock , '' Steingall told him , `` and then run slowly along East Broadway to the corner of Montgomery Street .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 22]: We are going to Morris Siegelman 's restaurant , which is a few doors higher up , on the north side .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 17]: If we stroll past you , pay no heed , but follow at a little distance .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 7]: Have you got that right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 11]: Devar was hugely delighted by the man 's discomfited tone .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 10]: `` Cheer up , Arthur , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 27]: `` You 'll be tickled to death to-morrow when you read the newspapers , and discover the part you played in a big news item . ''
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 22]: `` Now , do n't forget to lurch about the sidewalk , '' was Steingall 's next injunction to the amateurs .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 15]: `` Think of all the bad language you ever heard , and use it .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 10]: We 're toughs , and must behave as such .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 7]: Can either of you sing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 8]: `` I can , '' admitted Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 6]: `` That will help some .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 16]: Strike up any sort of sailor 's chanty when we 're in the restaurant . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 16]: Late as the hour , East Broadway was full to repletion with a cosmopolitan crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 46]: It was a Thursday evening , and the Hebrew Sabbath began at sunset on the following day , so the poor Jews of the quarter were out in their thousands , either buying provisions for the coming holiday or attracted by the light and bustle .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 44]: Heavy looking Russians , olive-skinned Italians , placid Germans , wild-eyed and pallid Czechs , lounged along the thoroughfare , chatting with compatriots , or gathering in amused groups to hear the strange patter of some voluble merchant retailing goods from a barrow .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 22]: From the interiors of tiny shops and cellars came eldritch voices crying the nature and remarkable qualities of the wares within .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 59]: Every hand-cart carried a flaring naphtha-lamp , and the glare of these innumerable torches created strong lights and flickering shadows which would have gladdened the heart of Rembrandt were his artistic wraith permitted to roam the by-ways of a city which , perhaps , he never heard of , even in its early Dutch guise as New Amsterdam .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 12]: The lofty tenement houses seemed to be crowded as the streets .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 24]: Within a square mile of that section of New York a quarter of a million people find habitation , food , and employment .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 39]: They supply each other 's needs , speak their own weird tongues , and by slow degrees become absorbed by the great continent which harbors them , and then only when a second or third generation becomes Americanized .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 31]: In such a motley throng four prowling stokers , ashore for a night 's spree , attracted scant attention , and Morris Siegelman 's hospitable door was reached without incident .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 38]: A taxi-cab was standing by the curb , and the driver , gazing at the living panorama of the street , little guessed that he had changed garments with one of the half-drunken firemen two hours earlier .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 8]: `` Here y' are , mattes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 58]: cried Steingall , joyously surveying a printed legend displayed among the bottles of a dingy bar running along the side of an apartment which had once been the parlor of a pretentious house , `` this is the right sort o ' dope -- vodka -- same as is supplied to the Czar of all the Roossias .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 23]: Get a pint of vodka into yer gizzards an ' you 'll think you 've swallowed a lump of red-hot clinker . ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 53]: Clancy hopped on to a high stool , and curled himself up on the rounded seat in the accepted posture of Buddha , while Devar , who was by way of being a gymnast , stood on his hands and beat a tattoo with his feet against the edge of the counter .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 10]: Not to be outdone , Curtis began to sing .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 19]: He had a good baritone voice , and entered with zest into the mad spirit of the frolic .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 10]: The song he chose was redolent of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 14]: It related a tar 's escapades among witches , cruisers , and girls .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 22]: Three of the latter claimed him at one and the same time -- so `` What was a sailor-boy to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 7]: Yeo-ho , Yeo-ho , Yeo-ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 23]: The chorus decided the point : `` Why , we went strolling down by the rolling , Down by the rolling sea .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 20]: If you ca n't be true to One or Two , You 're much better off with Three . ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 24]: Evidently , the roysterers ' antics commanded the general approval of Morris Siegelman 's patrons , and loud cries of `` Brava ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 4]: `` Encore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 4]: `` Bis ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 4]: `` Herrlich ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 6]: rewarded Curtis 's lyrical effort .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 20]: Some thirty people or more were scattered about the room , mostly in small parties seated around marble-topped tables .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 24]: Beer was the favorite beverage ; a minority was eating , the menu being strange and wondrous , and everyone was smoking cigarettes .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 36]: When Curtis received his share of the poisonous decoction so vaunted by Steingall , he faced the company , glass in hand , and saw Count Vassilan seated in a corner close to a window .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 52]: With him were a good-looking Italian girl and a youth , and the three were deep in eager converse , giving no heed to the other revelers , but rather taking advantage of the prevalent clatter of talk and drinking utensils to discuss whatever topic it was which proved so interesting .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 13]: Steingall 's eyes carried a question , and Curtis shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 32]: Vassilan 's male companion bore only the slight resemblance of a kindred nationality to the men who committed the murder , while he differed essentially from the treacherous `` Anatole . ''
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 42]: `` I wish your best girl could see you now , John D. , '' whispered Devar , who had just recovered from a violent fit of coughing induced by the raw whisky which Siegelman dispensed under the seal of vodka .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 14]: Curtis laughed at the conceit , which was grotesque in its very essence .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 38]: Wild and bizarre as his experiences had been that night , none was more whimsical than this bawling of a ballad in an East Broadway saloon while posing as a sailor with three sheets in the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 9]: `` Mostly Hungarians here , '' muttered Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 13]: `` We seem to be in the right place , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 10]: `` Let 's eat , '' said Clancy suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 26]: Reflected in a cracked mirror he had seen a man and two women rise and leave a table in the corner occupied by the Count .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 33]: He skipped off the stool , and made for the vacant place ; the others followed , and Curtis had several glasses raised to his honor as he passed through the merry-makers .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 15]: Clancy noisily summoned a waitress , and ordered four plates of spaghetti with tomatoes .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 43]: He sat with his back to the absorbed party beneath the window , and apologized with exaggerated politeness when his chair touched that of the Italian girl , though his accent , needless to say , was redolent of the East side .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 9]: `` They do not come , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 6]: he heard Vassilan say impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 28]: `` P'raps notta to-night , '' said the girl , `` but you sure meet-a dem here , mebbe to-morrow , mebbe de nex ' day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 13]: The Count tore a leaf from a notebook and scribbled something rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 34]: When he spoke , it was to the Hungarian , and in Magyar , but it was easy to guess that he was giving earnest directions as to the delivery of the note .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 21]: `` Now would be a good time to raise a row if we could manage it , '' growled Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 25]: Curtis was toying with his fourth meal since sunset , and admitted that he was ready for anything rather than spaghetti à la tomato .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 28]: `` If there 's enough varieties of Hungarians and Slavs in the street I can start a riot in less than no time , '' confided Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 4]: asked the detective .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 11]: `` This way , '' and Devar began to sing .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 37]: He owned a light tenor , clear and melodious , and the air had a curiously barbaric lilt which , musically considered , was reminiscent of the gypsies ' chorus in `` The Bohemian Girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 41]: But the words were couched in a strange tongue , sonorous and full voweled , and the Hungarians in the room became greatly stirred when it dawned on them that a semi-intoxicated American stoker was chanting a forbidden national melody .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 14]: Far better than he knew , he sounded uncharted deeps in human nature .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 51]: Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun stated an eternal truth when he wrote to the Marquis of Montrose : `` I know a very wise man that believed that if a man were permitted to make all the ballads he need not care who should make the laws of a nation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 36]: Before Devar had finished the first verse people from the street were crowding in through the open door , and flashing eyes and strange ejaculations showed that the Czechs thought they were witnessing a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 26]: As the second verse rang out , vibrant and challenging , the mob , eager to share in the interior excitement , rushed the entrance .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 34]: Many could hear , but few could see , and all were roused to exaltation by a melody the public singing of which would have brought imprisonment or death in their own land .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 6]: `` Now for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 13]: roared Steingall , and over went table and crockery with a crash .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 19]: Of course , this added to the turmoil , and some women in the café began to shriek .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 45]: Not knowing in the least what was causing the commotion , the crowd surged into that particular corner , and Steingall , apparently frenzied , sprang to the window , opened it , and said to Count Vassilan : `` Get out , quick !
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 10]: They 'll be knifing you in a minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 18]: The Italian girl screamed at that , so she was lifted into the safety of the street .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 63]: Vassilan followed , or rather was practically thrown out , and the young Hungarian could have climbed after him nimbly enough had not Curtis insisted on helping him , and , pinioning his arms , forced him head foremost over the sill , but not so rapidly that Steingall should be unable to `` go through him '' scientifically for the note .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 7]: `` Be off , you two !
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 8]: Take the car and go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 7]: It was no time for argument .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 21]: Both Curtis and Devar read into Steingall 's muttered injunction the belief that the hunt had ended for the night .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 37]: They knew that the detectives could take care of themselves , and they had scrambled through the window and made off swiftly in the direction of the waiting automobile before the despoiled Hungarian regained his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 25]: The hour yet wanted nearly ten minutes of being one o'clock , so the chauffeur had not budged from his post in the park .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 17]: Devar told him to start the engine , and be ready to jump off without delay .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 39]: Then they waited , and watched the corner of the square intersected by East Broadway , but neither Steingall nor Clancy appeared , so they judged it best to obey orders , and make for the Police Headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 19]: There they washed and resumed their own clothes , an operation which consumed another quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 28]: Still there was no sign of the detectives , and they decided , somewhat reluctantly , to do as they had been bidden , and go home .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 18]: `` What sort of witches ' shibboleth was that which you brought off in Siegelman 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 12]: asked Curtis , while the car was humming placidly up Broadway .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 12]: `` Oh , that was an inspiration , '' chuckled Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 11]: `` An inspiration founded on a solid basis of fact .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 7]: Now , out with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 40]: `` Well , I was a year at Heidelberg , you know , and a fellow there told me that one evening , in a café at Temesvar , a student kicked up a shindy by singing that song .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 32]: In less than a minute an officer had been stabbed with his own sword , and a policeman shot , and it took a squadron of cavalry to clear the street .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 20]: He learnt the blessed ditty , out of sheer curiosity , and I picked it up from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 8]: `` What is it all about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 25]: I believe it tells the Austrians their real name , but I could n't translate a line of it to save my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 9]: Curtis leaned back in the car and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 14]: `` You are by way of being a genius , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 34]: `` I have seen a crowd go stark , staring mad because some idiot waved a black flag , but that was a symbol of the Boxer rebellion , and it meant something .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 29]: In this instance , among people so far away from their own country , one would hardly expect -- '' He broke off suddenly , and leaned forward .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 22]: The car had just entered Madison Square , at the junction of Broadway and Fifth Avenue , south of 23rd Street .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 33]: A Columbus Avenue street-car had halted to allow traffic to pass , and a gray automobile which was coming out of Fifth Avenue had been held up by a policeman stationed there .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 46]: Curtis 's attention was caught by the color and shape of the vehicle , and in the flood of light cast by the powerful lamps and brilliant electric devices concentrated on that important crossing , he obtained a vivid glimpse of the chauffeur 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 34]: `` Devar , '' he said , and some electrical quality in his voice startled his mercurial companion , `` tell your man to overtake that car and run it into the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 17]: The driver is ` Anatole , ' and it is our duty to stop him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 13]: At that instant the policeman signaled the uptown traffic to move on .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 26]: CHAPTER XI ONE O'CLOCK Devar had the nimble wits of a fox , and the blood which raced in his veins was volatile as quicksilver .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 31]: The same glance which showed him the gray automobile stealing softly across the network of car-lines of one of the city 's main thoroughfares revealed a roundsman crossing the square .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 11]: `` Friend Anatole may be heeled , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 7]: `` Let 's get help . ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 21]: Leaning out , he shouted to Arthur , whose other name was Brodie : `` Pull in alongside the cop .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 8]: I want to speak to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 24]: The chauffeur obeyed , and the policeman turned a questioning eye on the car , thinking some idiot meant to run him down .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 9]: Devar had the door open in a second .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 17]: `` Have you heard of the murder in 27th Street , outside the Central Hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 12]: he said , almost bewildering the man by his eager directness .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 14]: `` Of course I have , '' came the answer , quickly enough .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 13]: `` Well , the car mixed up in it is right ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 9]: There it is , making for Fifth Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 3]: Jump in !
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 8]: We 'll explain as we go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 7]: The roundsman needed no second invitation .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 22]: Obviously , unless some brainless young fool was trying to be humorous , there was no time to spare for words .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 18]: He sprang inside , and Devar cried to the surprised chauffeur : `` Follow that gray auto .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 29]: Do n't kill anybody , but hit up the speed until we are close behind it , and then I 'll tell you what next to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 68]: Little recking what this order really meant , for its true inwardness was hidden at the moment from the ken of those far better versed than he in the tangle of events , Brodie changed gear and touched the accelerator , and the machine whirred past Admiral Farragut 's statue at a pace which would have caused even doughty `` Old Salamander '' to blink with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 39]: While four pairs of eyes were watching the fast moving vehicle in front , Curtis gave the policeman a brief resume of the night 's doings since he and Devar had gone with Steingall to the Police Headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 29]: There was no need to say much about the actual crime , because the man had full details , with descriptions of the man-slayers , in his notebook .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 8]: He was a shrewd person , too .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 24]: His name was McCulloch ; his father had emigrated from Belfast , and a man of such ancestry seldom takes anything for granted .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 33]: `` I suppose you are not quite certain , Mr. Curtis , that the chauffeur driving that car ahead is the ` Anatole ' concerned in the death of Mr. Hunter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 10]: But Curtis was of a cautious temperament , too .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 28]: `` No , '' he said , `` that is more than I dare state , even if I had an opportunity to look at him closely .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 18]: As it is , I merely received what I may term ` an impression ' of him .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 31]: That , together with the marked similarity of the car to the one I saw outside the hotel , seems to offer reasonable ground for inquiry at any rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 11]: `` Did you notice the number of this car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 6]: `` No , not exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 17]: I believe it differs from that which I undoubtedly did see and put on record . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 20]: `` Of course , the plate must have been changed or he would never venture in this locality again .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 33]: If you are right , sir , the fellow must possess a mighty cool nerve , because he is just passing 27th Street , within a few yards of the hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 46]: Somehow , the fact had escaped Curtis 's remembrance ; excellent though his topographical sense might be , he was still sufficient of a stranger in New York not to appreciate the bearings of particular localities with the prompt discrimination necessarily displayed by the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 14]: During the succeeding few seconds none of the occupants of the limousine spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 51]: Devar was kneeling on one of the front seats , and the roundsman , who had removed his uniform hat to avoid attracting notice when a lamp shone directly into the interior , quietly took stock of the men who had so unceremoniously called him off his tour of inspection .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 15]: Evidently he satisfied himself that he was not being dragged into a wild-goose chase .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 45]: Their tense manner could hardly have been assumed : they were in desperate and deadly earnest ; so he thanked the stars which had brought him into active connection with an important crime , and gave his mind strictly to the business in hand .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 9]: Several knotty points demanded careful if speedy decision .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 68]: The chased automobile might prove to be an innocent vehicle , driven by a chauffeur above suspicion , and if its owner appeared in the guise of some highly influential person he , the roundsman , might be called to sharp account for exceeding his duty in making an arrest , or , if he stopped short of that extreme course , in conducting an offensive inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 17]: Brodie took his instructions literally , and the distance between the two cars was diminishing sensibly .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 57]: It seemed , too , as though the driver of the gray car slackened pace after passing 27th Street , although Fifth Avenue was fairly clear of traffic , which , such as it was , consisted mainly of motors going uptown -- that is to say , in the same direction as pursued and pursuer .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 7]: At 34th Street came a check .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 38]: A cross-town street-car caused the gray automobile to swerve rapidly in order to avoid a collision , and Brodie , a methodical person of law-abiding instincts , lost nearly fifty yards in allowing the streetcar to pass .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 55]: `` Whoever he may be , he is not going to make any unnecessary stops , '' commented the roundsman , fully alive to the significance of the incident , since ninety-nine drivers out of a hundred would have applied the brake and allowed the heavy public conveyance to get out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 38]: `` Unless the Hungarian assassins of New York are bang up-to-date in the benzine part of their stock-in-trade , our car will make good in the next two blocks , '' said Devar , over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 15]: And , indeed , it almost appeared that Brodie had heard what was said .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 36]: He bent forward slightly , touched a few taps with skilled fingers , squared his shoulders , and set about the race with the air of a man who thought it had lasted long enough .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 30]: Nearing 42nd Street , he had reduced the gap to little more than twice the length of the car , and the three men saw the number plate clearly .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 14]: Not only did the number differ , but it was of another series .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 13]: `` That 's a New Jersey car , '' announced the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 34]: `` It may be a New Jersey number , '' Curtis corrected him , `` but I still retain my belief that we are following the right man and the right car . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 25]: Just then no less than four cross-town electric cars loomed into sight , and completely blocked the avenue at its intersection with 42nd Street .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 25]: The gray automobile had to pull up very quickly , and Brodie was compelled to execute a neat half-turn to clear the rear wheels .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 32]: In the result , both cars halted side by side , but Curtis found himself just short of a position whence he could obtain a second look at the suspected man .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 35]: The policeman had bent low in his seat , lest his uniform should be seen , but he , like his companions , gave a sharp glance into the interior of the other car .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 4]: It was empty .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 42]: He was seated on the near side , however , and he noticed that the lower panel behind the door had been cleaned since the remainder of the paint-work was touched , and the step bore signs of a recent washing .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 12]: Devar lowered one of the front sashes a couple of inches .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 44]: `` Do n't look round , Arthur , '' he said in a low tone , `` and do n't take any notice of the chauffeur , but creep forward a foot or two , and then let him go ahead again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 16]: Brodie sat like a sphinx , and apparently did nothing , yet the car moved .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 19]: Sacrificing himself , Roundsman McCulloch fell back into his corner , and left the window clear for Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 29]: he inquired , and , surfeited though he might be with New York sensations , the others were conscious of just a hint of excitement in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 14]: `` That is Anatole , I am nearly sure , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 11]: `` Why not jump out and grab him now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 3]: suggested Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 12]: `` Do you gentlemen mind following him for a time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 4]: asked the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 9]: `` No , I 'm game for anything .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 6]: And you , Curtis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 15]: `` Oh , I feel ready to start the night all over again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 16]: The street-cars went on , and the gray automobile darted through the first possible opening .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 14]: `` You see , it is this way , '' explained the official .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 28]: `` I am prepared to arrest the man on Mr. Curtis 's evidence , because I could n't have better testimony than that of the chief witness .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 28]: But I 've been chewing on this thing for the past few minutes , and it strikes me that we gain nothing by acting in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 52]: You may be sure that this fellow , even if he is the person we want , will deny it , and a day or two may be lost in proving his identity , or collecting facts which would support the theory that he was the chauffeur connected with the crime .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 19]: Now , if we let him go on , we shall certainly have a better hold over him .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 33]: We 'll find out his destination -- perhaps secure a very useful address , or , with real luck , discover that he is keeping a fixture with some other individual . ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 15]: `` In a word , we must watch and pray , '' said Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 18]: `` Well , we can wait and see , anyhow , '' said the practical minded McCulloch .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 48]: His counsel sounded good , and the others agreed with him , thereby letting themselves and the patient Brodie in for some remarkable developments in a pursuit which began by a simple coincidence and was destined to end in a manner which none of them dreamed of .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 6]: Devar opened the window again .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 24]: `` Arthur , '' he said , `` did you happen to notice whether or not that fellow is carrying a reflector ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 4]: He has one .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 12]: I saw him looking into it when I drew alongside . ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 30]: `` Ah , that puts a different complexion on the affair , as the young man said when he kissed his best girl and tasted Somebody 's Beauty Powder .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 6]: Do n't press , Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 12]: Just keep him in sight till I consult the law . ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 14]: As the outcome of a hurried discussion , Brodie received a fresh mandate .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 72]: During the straightaway run he was not to approach the gray car nearer than sixty yards or thereabouts -- in effect , remaining within the same block if possible , but , if the gray car stopped in front of any dwelling , he was to slacken speed and pass it , taking the middle of the road , and holding himself in instant readiness to halt or turn as directed .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 13]: `` By the way , how are you fixed for petrol ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 3]: added Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 13]: `` I filled the tanks , sir , before leaving the garage .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 12]: We 're good for the trip to Albany and back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 7]: Brodie 's tone was quite cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 55]: He , too , had been reviewing the situation , and the presence of a uniformed policeman had dispelled the last shred of suspicion that some stupid joke had been worked off outside the Police Headquarters when a fearsome looking tough was introduced to him as the Chief of the New York Detective Bureau .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 37]: Devar was about to congratulate the roundsman on the prospect of an all-night journey if Brodie 's chance phrase were fated to come true , when he glanced at Curtis , and elected to remain silent .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 19]: They were passing the Plaza Hotel , and his friend was peering up at its square white bulk .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 11]: Obviously , he was striving to locate Hermione 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 37]: Most probably he failed , for it is no easy matter to pick out the windows of any particular set of rooms in a huge building while rushing along at twenty-five or more miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 36]: Further , it was now past one o'clock in the morning , and most respectable people were in bed , so the solemn mass of the hotel was enlivened by very few rectangles of light .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 47]: But Curtis fancied , as did Devar also , that the illuminated blinds of three windows on the second floor might possibly be those of Suite F. , and each wondered , if the surmise were correct , why her ladyship was remaining up so late .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 25]: Devar resolved to say nothing , but Curtis felt that he must talk , if only for the sake of hearing his own voice .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 68]: Usually a man of taciturn habit , the outcome of long vigils among an alien and often hostile race in a semi-civilized land , he had gone through so much during the five and a half hours which had unfolded their marvels since he quitted the dining-room of the Central Hotel , that he ached for human sympathy , even in a trivial matter of this sort .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 17]: `` I thought I saw a light in my wife 's rooms , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 14]: `` As you mention it , so did I , '' agreed Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 11]: `` I hope she is not awaiting my return ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 9]: `` Perhaps she is anxious about you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 5]: `` But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 7]: `` Women are given that way .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 16]: She knows you went out with Steingall , and he is a dangerous character . ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 10]: `` Is Mrs. Curtis staying in the Plaza ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 5]: asked the puzzled McCulloch .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 17]: `` But I thought you occupied a room at the Central Hotel in 27th Street ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 20]: `` I did , but I got married at half-past eight , and we went to the Plaza . ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 12]: `` Married at half-past eight -- just after the murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 11]: The policeman 's words formed a crescendo of sheer surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 18]: For some indefinable reason this curious conjunction of a crime and a wedding went beyond his comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 7]: `` Yes , it happened so .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 33]: It might have been avoided , yet , looking back now over the whole of the circumstances , it would appear that I have followed a beaten track inevitable as death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 27]: Of course , the roundsman could not grasp the somber thought underlying Curtis 's words , but a species of indeterminate suspicion prompted his next question .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 16]: `` You came from the Plaza with Mr. Steingall , I believe , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 37]: We were having supper there , with Mr. Devar and my uncle and aunt , when Mr. Clancy rang him up on the telephone , and he invited us to accompany him to the Police Headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 6]: The rest you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 8]: Certainly , the explanation sounded quite satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 47]: The attitude of these two young men and their chauffeur was perfectly correct , and the policeman 's views had been strengthened materially by the tell-tale tokens he had noted on the gray car , which , however , he had not thought fit to mention .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 57]: If Steingall had attended the supper in the Plaza he must have convinced himself that there was nothing unusual , or , at any rate , doubtful , about the queer fact that a man who was mixed up in a remarkable murder should have gone straight from the scene of the tragedy and got married .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 40]: Just to dispel a little of the mist that befogged his brain , he waited a while and then said : `` Which side of the car was opposite the doorway when those two men attacked Mr. Hunter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 4]: `` The left .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 10]: The car had entered the street from Broadway . ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 7]: `` Why do you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 14]: inquired Devar , instantly alive to the queerness of this alteration of topics .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 19]: `` My mind went back to the job we have in hand , '' said the roundsman readily .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 16]: `` I was wondering just what sort of glimpse Mr. Curtis obtained of the chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 27]: Of course , I see now that he was looking at the man exactly under similar conditions when we made that stop at 42nd Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 78]: Thus , unknown to either of the parties to the alliance , a minor crisis was averted , because it may safely be conceded that the hard-headed policeman would have refused then and there to accept any sort of statement from such a lunatic as John Delancy Curtis , if he were given a full , true , and particular account of the night 's proceedings while being whirled up Fifth Avenue in a fast moving automobile .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 26]: Romance , if it is to be accepted without question , requires the setting of a comfortable armchair or tree-shaded nook in a summer garden .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 62]: There , forgetting and forgotten by the world , man or maid may indeed be carried far on the Magic Carpet of Tangu , but , when served out by two strangers to a prosaic policeman seated in a humming car , and bound Heaven knew whither long after midnight , it is apt to savor of the moon and witchcraft .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 13]: Away up the straight vista of Fifth Avenue sped the two cars .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 24]: On the left lay the black solitude of Central Park , on the right the varied architecture of New York 's millionaire dwellings .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 32]: Devar and the policeman talked cheerfully enough , but Curtis was wrapped in his own musings till the rear lamp of the gray car suddenly curved to the left and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 28]: `` He has turned into the Parkway at 110th Street , '' said McCulloch , and Curtis awoke with a start to a sense of his surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 17]: `` I suppose he 's making for St. Nicholas Avenue , '' went on the roundsman .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 35]: demanded Curtis , whose recollections of map-study would have reminded him , in other conditions , that the avenue named by McCulloch is one of the few which slant across the city 's rectangles .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 30]: `` Well , sir , it 's only a guess , but St. Nicholas Avenue is a short cut to Washington Heights , and cars often follow that route .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 7]: Yes , there he goes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 28]: For an instant they caught a fleeting glimpse of Lenox Avenue , which runs parallel with Fifth , and then they were bowling along St. Nicholas Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 31]: After a half-mile or less , they crossed Eighth Avenue at an acute angle , but the gray car kept steadily on , and soon was skirting St. Nicholas Park .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 19]: Thenceforth another mile and a half counted as little until the flying automobile gained the Harlem River Speedway .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 5]: Here the pace improved .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 34]: There was practically no traffic to interfere with progress now , and Brodie had to maintain an equable rate of forty miles an hour in order to keep within sight of his quarry .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 35]: At last , by way of Nagle and Amsterdam Avenues , they regained Broadway itself , at the point where its many sinuosities end at the bridges over the Harlem River and Spuyten Creek .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 9]: By this time , McCulloch was undeniably anxious .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 32]: Many a mile separated him from the busy activities of Madison Square and its surroundings , and the main roads of the State of New York were opening up their possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 38]: Still , he was of Scotch-Irish stock , and even the most ardent Nationalist would be slow to maintain that the men from beyond the Boyne are what is popularly and tersely described as `` quitters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 29]: `` I 'd be better pleased if I had any sort of notion where that joker was heading for , '' he said , with a grim smile .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 17]: `` I did n't count on taking a joy-ride at this hour of the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 10]: That was his sole concession to outraged official decorum .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 33]: He accepted a cigar , and forthwith resigned himself to the exigencies of the chase , which lay not with him but with the dark and devious purposes of the sinister Anatole .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 17]: The end , however , was nearer than any of them was now inclined to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 21]: A rapid run along the main road through Yonkers brought them to Hastings and the bank of the Hudson River .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 38]: The comparatively level grades of New York were replaced by hilly ground , and if they would avoid courting observation beyond any doubt of error it was essential that the gray car should be allowed greater latitude .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 43]: In fact , it was almost demonstrable that an alert criminal like the man they were pursuing -- if he really were the ally of Hunter 's slayers -- could hardly have failed to realize much earlier that he was being followed .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 36]: Moreover , being an expert motorist , he would know that the car in the rear could not only hold him in the race but close up with him whenever its occupants were so minded .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 27]: He would not be lulled into false security by the present widening of the gap , because that was an obvious maneuver due to altered circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 54]: In a word , there was now no hope or prospect of running him to earth at a rendezvous , but , giving him credit for the possession and use of a criminal 's brains , it became an urgent matter to overtake him and compel a halt by deliberately blocking the way .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 21]: They debated the point fully , and Devar was about to tell Brodie to act when the gray car disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 16]: Not wishing to interfere at a critical moment , Devar drew back from the window .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 42]: Brodie spurted down a hill and along a short level lined with suburban villas ; he slowed to take a sharp corner , and the car ran along a winding lane which could lead nowhere but to the water 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 15]: It was pitch dark , and a mist from the Hudson filled the valley .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 47]: Common sense urged a careful pace , because it had never been possible to stop and adjust the powerful headlights , while the luminous haze of an occasional street lamp served only to reveal the narrowness of the road and the presence of shacks and warehouses .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 35]: The descent was fairly steep , so Brodie shut off the engine , and the big car crept on with a stealthy and noiseless rapidity which seemed to betoken an actual sense of danger .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 35]: Suddenly they heard a loud splash , accompanied by a muffled explosion , and McCulloch relieved his feelings by a few words , the use of which is expressly forbidden by the police manual .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 29]: But their purport was ridiculously clear ; the gray car had plunged into the Hudson , and who could tell whether or not Anatole had gone with it ?
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 37]: Curtis was the first to adopt a definite line of reasoning : he assumed command now with the confidence of one accustomed to be in tight places and to depend on his own wits for extrication .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 32]: `` Go forward slowly until the buildings stop , Brodie , '' he said , for the two front windows were lowered , and the three men were crowded at them .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 10]: `` That fellow knew exactly where he was going .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 32]: When you pull up , light the acetylene lamps , and we will take the other pair and search the wharf from which that car was shot into the stream . ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 22]: Within a few yards the brakes went on with a jerk , and a tall crane loomed up vaguely in front .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 26]: All four men sprang to the ground , and while the chauffeur busied himself with the big lamps Curtis and Devar disconnected the smaller ones .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 34]: They found themselves standing on a wooden quay , evidently used for the trans-shipment of building materials , and a quick scrutiny showed that the lane supplied the only practicable means of egress .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 18]: Some gaunt sheds blocked one end of the wharf and piles of dressed stone cumbered the other .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 39]: The tiny wavelets of the river murmured and gurgled amid the heavy piles which shored up the landing-place , and Devar 's sharp eyes soon detected a corner of the gray-colored limousine round which a ripple had formed .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 42]: In all probability the heated cylinders had burst when the water rushed in , and the explosion had tilted the chassis , else the river , necessarily deep by the side of the quay , would have concealed the wreckage completely .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 10]: From out of the mist came a white glare .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 20]: Brodie had set the lamps going , and now the square section of the submerged car became distinctly visible .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 27]: A little to one side a barge was moored , and the policeman , who had produced a serviceable looking revolver , determined to search it .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 39]: A plank spanned the foot or so of interstice between the quay and the rough deck , and , in the flurry of the moment , the three men crossed without warning the chauffeur as to their movements .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 32]: The squat craft had an open well amidships , but there were two covered-in ends , and McCulloch , taking one of the lamps , peered down into the nearest hatchway .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 27]: `` If anyone is below there , speak , '' he said , `` or I give you warning that I shall shoot at sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 17]: There was no answer ; he knelt down , lowered the lamp , and peered inside .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 4]: `` Empty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 3]: he announced .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 8]: `` Now for the other one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 15]: He repeated the same tactics , but the cavity revealed no lurking form within .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 37]: Naturally , his companions were absorbed in McCulloch 's actions , because they knew that any instant a blinding sheet of flame might leap out of the darkness and a bullet send him prostrate and writhing .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 63]: Of the three , Curtis was most inured to an environment that was unusual and weird , and he it was who first noticed that the barge was altering its position with regard to the white discs of light which the lamps of the automobile formed in the mist , and a splash caused by the falling plank confirmed his frenzied doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 7]: One glance showed what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 23]: Already they were ten or twelve feet from the quay , which stood fully two feet above the deck of the barge .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 24]: Even while the fantastic notion flashed through his mind , a shoreward jump barely achievable by a first-rate athlete became a sheer impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 5]: `` Good Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 8]: he cried , almost laughing with vexation .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 12]: `` The barge has been cast off from her moorings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 20]: Devar and McCulloch greeted the discovery with appropriate remarks , but the situation called for deeds rather than words .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 41]: The cumbrous craft was swinging gayly out into the stream , displaying a light-hearted energy and ease of motion which would certainly not have been forthcoming had it been the object of her unwilling crew to get her under way .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 51]: The whereabouts of Brodie and the automobile were still vaguely discernible by two fast converging luminous circles now some twenty yards distant , and the fact was painfully borne in on them that in another few seconds this landmark would be swallowed in a sea of mist and swirling waters .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 28]: Curtis , accustomed to the vagaries of Chinese junks in the swift currents of the Yang-tse-Kiang , adopted the only measures which promised any degree of success .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 26]: He ran to the helm , which had been lashed on the starboard side to keep it from fouling any submerged piles near the bank .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 42]: Casting it loose , he put it hard a-port , and shouted to the policeman and Devar to bring a couple of boards from the floor of the well , and use them to sheer in the hulk to the bank .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 38]: The night was pitch dark , the mist fell on them like an impenetrable veil , and the wooded heights which dominated both banks of the river prevented any ray of light from coming to their assistance .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 37]: Still , they had two lamps , which at least enabled them to see each other , and Curtis could judge with reasonable accuracy of the direction they were taking by the set of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 23]: They seemed to have been toiling a weary time before the helmsman fancied he could see something looming out of the void .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 65]: He believed that , however slowly , they were surely forging inshore again , and was about to ask Devar to abandon his valiant efforts to convert a long plank into a paddle and go forward in order to keep a lookout , when the barge crashed heavily into the stern of a ship of some sort , and simultaneously bumped into a wharf .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 23]: The noise was terrific , coming so unexpectedly out of the silence , and their argosy careened dangerously under some obstruction forward .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 6]: No orders were needed now .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 64]: They scrambled ashore , abandoning one of the lamps in their desperate hurry , and the policeman instantly extinguished the light of the other by pressing the glass closely to his breast when a rumble of curses heralded the coming on deck of two men who had been aroused from sleep on board the vessel by the thunderous onset of the colliding barge .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 77]: CHAPTER XII TWO-THIRTY A. M. Few men or women of sympathetic nature , and gifted with ordinary powers of observation , can go through life without learning , at some time or other in the course of their careers , that circumstances wholly beyond human control can display on occasion a fiendish faculty of converting patent honesty into apparent dishonesty -- and that which is true of motive holds equally good in the case of conduct .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 125]: The three men standing breathless and unmoved on some unknown wharf on the left bank of the Hudson might fairly be described as superlatively honest persons , nor had they done any act which could be construed as wrongful by the most captious critic ; yet McCulloch 's concealment of the lamp suggested something thievish and illicit , and , though he alone could give a valid reason for exercising extreme discretion , because he realized , better than the others , what a choice morsel this adventure would supply to the press if ever it became known , both Curtis and Devar listened like himself with bated breath to the oaths and ejaculations which came from the after part of the moored vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 5]: `` Howly war ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 7]: cried one of the startled crew .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 37]: `` See what 's butted into us -- the divvle 's own battherin ' - ram av a scow , an ' wid an ilegant lanthern shtuck on her mangy hide , if ye plaze . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 38]: A ship 's lamp bobbed up and down in the gloom , and another voice said gruffly : `` Mighty good job we had those fenders out , or she would have knocked a hole in us .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 26]: She seems to be wedged in good and hard under our mooring rope ; but shin over , Pat , an ' make her fast .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 26]: Somebody owns the brute , an ' there 'll be damages to pay for this , an ' p ` raps salvage as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 8]: The Irishman dropped down into the barge .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 25]: The silent trio on the quay heard him walking to the lamp , and saw its dull orb of radiance lifted from the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 18]: `` Begob , but this is a bit of a fairy tale , '' came the comment .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 31]: `` Here is none o ' yer tin-cint Standard Ile prapositions , but a rale dandy uv a lamp , fit for a lady 's cabin on Vandherbilt 's yacht .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 41]: An ' , for the luv o ' Hiven , look at the make uv it , wid a handle where the bottom ought to be , an ' all polished up like the pewther in Casey 's saloon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 22]: `` Oh , get a move on , Pat , an ' tie her up , '' said the other voice .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 21]: `` It 's the Lord knows what o'clock , an ' we 've a long day before us to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 12]: The lamp moved astern , and the Irishman investigated matters further .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 14]: `` There 's bin black wur-rk here , George , '' he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 8]: `` The moorin ' rope nivver bruk .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 5]: It was cut . ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 16]: A sharp hiss of breath between McCulloch 's teeth betrayed the stress of his emotions .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 25]: To think that he , a smart roundsman of the Broadway squad , should have been bested so thoroughly by a miserable alien chauffeur !
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 83]: The man had merely slipped over the edge of the quay , and clung like a limpet to the rough baulks of timber which faced it ; when his pursuers were safely disposed of on board the barge , one cut of a sharp knife had sent them adrift by the stern , while the forward rope , released of any strain , had probably uncoiled itself from a stanchion with the diabolical ingenuity which inanimate objects can display at unlooked-for moments .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 13]: `` Fling a coil uv line here , '' continued the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 14]: `` This fag ind is no good , at all at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 24]: The thud of a falling rope , and various grunts and comments from the Irishman , showed that the barge was being secured .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 5]: Still the three waited .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 76]: The primary display of secrecy , the instinct to remain unseen , had passed , but there was nothing to be gained by entering into a long and difficult explanation with the ship 's hands , while it would be a simple matter to recoup the owner of the barge for any charge which might be levied on him for injury to the vessel , provided the liability rested with him and not with others .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 14]: Swearing and grumbling , Pat stumbled along the quay , carrying the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 26]: He passed within a few feet of the motionless group , and soon they heard him and his mate descending the companionway to their bunks .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 21]: `` Now for a light , '' said the policeman , `` and let 's get out of this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 39]: Taking heed not to turn the lamp toward the ship , lest their movements should be overheard and a head pop up out of the hatch , he led the way quietly to the rear of the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 29]: A rough road climbed the hill to the left , and , as this direction offered the only probable means of regaining the car , they took it .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 19]: After a long climb they reached a better road , which ultimately brought them into a main thoroughfare .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 23]: Then Curtis bethought him of looking at his watch , and was astonished to find that the hour was half-past two o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 13]: `` We must have consumed fully half an hour over that trip .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 24]: I wonder whether your man has waited , Devar ; or would he give us up as lost , and go home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 34]: Arthur return alone , and tell my aunt that the last he saw of me I was adrift on the Hudson River in a barge with a policeman and a swashbuckler from Pekin ?
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 4]: Not much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 13]: `` I hope you are right , sir , '' said McCulloch .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 50]: `` Even when we reach New York I must trouble you two gentlemen to come to the station-house and report the whole affair , as I was due there an hour ago , and the entire precinct will have been scoured for news of me by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 4]: Devar laughed loudly .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 76]: `` I do n't want to alarm you , McCulloch -- not that you are of the neurotic habit , judging by the way you took a chance of having a hole bored through you while searching that blessed barge -- but if you believe you can frame a cut-and-dried programme during the time you have retained John D. Curtis 's services as guide , philosopher , and friend , you are hugging a delusion .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 26]: I started out from a happy home last evening intending to pick up a friendless stranger and show him the orthodox sights of New York .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 3]: Gee whizz !
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 5]: Look at me now !
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 29]: I missed John D. by a few minutes , but found myself gaping with the crowd at the scene of a murder in which he had figured heavily .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 66]: Since then I have helped to break open hotel doors , discovered a villain tied and gagged by other villains , stood on my head in Morris Siegelman 's joint , started a riot in East Broadway , helped a detective to commit a larceny , cheeked a British lord , and scoffed at a Hungarian prince , to say nothing of the present racket .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 37]: So do n't you go making plans for the night yet a while , McCulloch , because John D. will keep you busy without any call for you exercising your brain cells in that respect . ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 14]: The roundsman did not try to grasp the inner significance of this rigmarole .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 12]: He was unfeignedly glad to have escaped from an awkward predicament .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 37]: `` Anyhow , '' he said briefly , `` if it comes to the worst I can ring up my captain from the nearest station-house , and at least he will know where I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 11]: `` Do n't be too sure of that , either .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 23]: Suppose you had ` phoned your captain before you went on board the barge , would he be any the wiser now ?
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 21]: Just to prove the exceeding wisdom of my remarks , do you know where you are at the present moment ?
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 8]: Because _ I _ do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 13]: The policeman stopped short , and gazed ahead with a new anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 25]: The mist was thinner here , and pin-points of light from a row of lamps showed in a straight line for a considerable distance .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 36]: For an instant there was an embarrassed pause , because all three failed to remember covering any similar stretch of level road after descending the hill and turning into the lane leading to the Hudson .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 20]: `` Did you notice a few minutes since that a low wall bounded the road on both sides ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 9]: said Curtis , breaking a somewhat strained silence .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 7]: Yes , each had seen it .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 40]: `` Well , I am inclined to believe , '' he went on , `` that that wall formed part of an accommodation bridge , under which the car passed in the dark without our being aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 35]: Indeed , I feel confident that if we turn back along this main road , we shall meet our lane on the right , and about three hundred yards from this very point . ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 22]: They agreed to make the experiment , and Devar grinned broadly when the lane presented itself exactly as Curtis had predicted .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 8]: `` What did I tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 6]: he cackled to the roundsman .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 8]: `` John D. is a Chinese necromancer .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 20]: I 'm getting used to his tricks , and you will catch the habit in another hour or two .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 42]: By four o'clock you wo n't be the least bit surprised if you find yourself flying across the New Jersey flats in an aeroplane , or having a cup of hot coffee on board the pilot steamer off Sandy Hook . ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 28]: `` I 'll risk either of those unlikely things , sir , if we find your car where we left it , '' They stepped out briskly .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 49]: When all was said and done , none of the three wished to be stranded in some unknown byway of Westchester County at that ungodly hour , and their relief was great when the stark outline of the crane became visible in an otherwise impenetrable wall of darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 4]: `` By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 12]: The car is here all right , '' crowed Devar joyously .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 24]: In the next few strides the automobile came in sight , the blaze of its headlights casting a cheerful glow over the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 32]: Brodie was standing where the barge had been moored , and gazing blankly at the river ; he turned when he heard their footsteps , and ran quickly to the car .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 54]: `` It 's O. K. , Arthur , '' cried Devar , realizing that the chauffeur might be dreading an attack from the rear , `` little Willie has returned , and wo n't go boating again in a derelict barge at two o'clock in the morning if he can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 10]: `` Oh , it 's you , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 10]: came the answer in a tone of vast relief .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 11]: `` My , but I 'm glad to see you !
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 8]: I did n't know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 62]: I thought you were safe enough , because I heard your voices as you drifted away , and I fancied you might make the shore again lower down , but it seemed to be a hopeless job to go in search of you , so , after things had calmed down a bit , I decided to stop right here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 26]: After the first gasp of excitement , there had crept into the placid Brodie 's voice a note of quiet jubilation which hinted at developments .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 10]: `` Did anything happen after we sailed away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 3]: asked Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 7]: `` Did you see anyone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 4]: demanded the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 45]: `` Things were quiet as the grave for quite a time after you gentlemen disappeared , '' said Brodie , speaking with the unctuous slowness of a man who has been vouchsafed the opportunity of his life and has grabbed it with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 10]: `` Something _ did _ occur , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 5]: put in Devar impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 17]: `` Nothing to speak of , sir -- at first , '' came the irritating answer .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 51]: `` I watched you go on board the barge , and I noticed her edging out into the river , and it was easy enough to know that none of you had cast her off , because what you said showed that you were even more surprised than I was .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 67]: So , sez I to meself , ` Arthur , me boy , barges do n't untie themselves from wharves in that casual sort of way , and at just the right minute , too , for anyone who wanted to dispose of a cop , ' begging your pardon , Mr. Policeman , but that was the line of argument I had with meself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 11]: `` Try the accelerator , Arthur , '' groaned Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 44]: `` If ever I meet with a bit of an accident , sir , I always pull up and plan the wheel-marks ; I carry a tape for the purpose , and it saves a lot of hard swearing in court afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 26]: Brodie spoke seriously , and Devar vowed that he would interrupt no more , since he merely succeeded in stimulating the man 's torpid wits .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 19]: Even now , the chauffeur waited to allow his philosophy to sink into minds which might prove unreceptive .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 125]: Finding that there was no likelihood of debate , he went on : `` It struck me , too , that a feller who did n't hesitate about shoving a good car into a river must be a rank tough , the kind of character who would jump at the chance of plugging me with a bullet , or two , for that matter , and hiking off with the car , without anybody being the wiser , so I nipped out from behind the wheel , and , taking care to keep away from the light , crept in behind that pile of rock there , '' and he nodded to the mass of dressed stone which filled one end of the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 14]: He waited , as though to make sure that they appreciated his generalship .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 15]: Devar 's teeth grated , and McCulloch stirred uneasily , but no one spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 54]: `` You 'll notice that it is only a few feet away , '' he said , measuring the distance with a thoughtful eye , `` but , to make sure of reaching anybody who might try to monkey with the car , I groped around until I had found two half bricks .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 4]: Then I waited .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 33]: By that time , which was really less than it takes me to tell you about it , there was n't a sound to be heard but the lapping of the river .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 32]: The last thing I heard you say , Mr. Howard , was -- '' `` I used language which no self-respecting chauffeur could possibly repeat , '' broke in Devar despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 9]: `` That 's as may be , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 13]: Circumstances alter cases , as you will see before I 've done .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 67]: Well , I listened to the river , which resembled nothing in all the world so much as the sobbing of a child , but no one stirred for such a time that I began to feel stiff , and I was thinking that I might be acting like a fool for my pains when a head popped up over the edge of the wharf . ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 15]: Obviously , this sentence demanded a dramatic pause , and Brodie knew his business .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 37]: Perhaps he expected cries of horror from his audience , but none was forthcoming , so , with a sigh , he continued : `` That cured the stiffness , gentlemen , I can assure you .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 39]: I balanced one of the half bricks in my left hand -- I 'm a left-handed man in many things -- and watched the head , while it was easy to see that the head watched the car .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 50]: ` Now , ' sez I to meself , ` that 's the whelp who mistreated a car which had served him well , and he 's reckoning in his own mind that my car would suit his needs just as well as the one he has lost . '
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 11]: I do believe I read that man 's mind correctly .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 15]: He might have said out loud : ` That party of sports were muts .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 14]: They 're all aboard the Hudson River liner , chauffeur and all . '
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 39]: I beg your pardon , gentlemen , if I have put it awkwardly , but I am sort of feeling my way towards the feller 's sentiments , groping in the dark , as you might say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 15]: Notwithstanding his effort at self-restraint , Devar felt that he must speak or explode .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 11]: `` Go right ahead , Arthur , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 6]: `` Explain the position thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 15]: The fog is lifting , and we have heaps of time before sunrise . ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 17]: `` The whole affair is a mighty queer business , sir , '' said Brodie seriously .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 17]: `` The roundsman here will tell you how careful one has to be in such matters .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 23]: I have had a law-case or two in my time , and them lawyers turn you inside out if you begin romancing .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 13]: For instance , what I 've just told you is n't evidence .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 9]: The man said nothing ; neither did I .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 35]: We played a fine game of cat and mouse , only it happened that I was the cat ... Well , it is getting late , so I 'll get on with the story .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 43]: The head did n't budge for quite a while , but at last it made a move , and soon the identical chauffeur who hit up the pace from 23rd Street climbed on to the wharf and dodged in behind the crane .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 29]: He had something in his right hand , too , that I did n't like the look of , so I gripped my chunk of brick mighty hard .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 29]: This time he did n't wait so long , but crept forward like a stage murderer , peeping this way and that , but making for the car .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 58]: Once he looked straight at where I was crouching , and I was scared stiff , because a brick ai n't any fair match for one of them new-fangled pistols at six yards or so ; but I guess he was a bit nervy himself , and he did n't make out anything unusual in my direction .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 20]: Then he dodged right round the car to the back , and returned on the side nearest to me .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 25]: I suppose he reckoned all was safe by that time , so he took hold of the crank and began to start the engine .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 6]: ` Now or never ! '
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 36]: says I to meself , so up I gets , and my knee joints cracked like -- well , they cracked so loud that only the turning of the crank stopped him from hearing them .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 22]: With that , I let drive with the half brick , and caught him square in the small of the back .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 14]: Down he went with a yell , and me on top of him .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 39]: I had the second half brick ready to batter his skull in if he showed fight , but the first one had laid him out sufficient for my purpose , which was to get hold of this . ''
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 18]: Brodie 's hand dived into a pocket , and he produced a particularly vicious looking automatic pistol .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 11]: Then McCulloch said imperatively : `` You 've got him .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 5]: Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 6]: Brodie was really an artist .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 24]: Some men would have smirked with triumph , but he merely jerked a thumb casually toward the automobile : `` In there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 11]: The policeman ran to a door and wrenched it open .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 29]: He turned the rays of the lamp which he still held in his hand on to a figure , lying kneeling on the floor in an extraordinary attitude .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 47]: From a white face a pair of gleaming eyes met his in a glance of hate and fear , but no words came from the thin lips set in a line , and a moment 's scrutiny showed that the captive was bound hand and foot .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 53]: Indeed , hands and feet were fastened together with a stout cord , which had been passed around the man 's neck subsequently , so that he was in some danger of suffocation if he endeavored to wriggle loose , or even straighten his back , which was bent over his heels .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 18]: `` He 's all right , '' said Brodie , who had strolled leisurely after the others .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 29]: `` I told him I was taking no chances , and was compelled to make him uncomfortable , but that he would n't choke if he kept quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 22]: Of course , he has had a rather trying wait , but I could n't help that , could I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 10]: `` We give you best , '' growled McCulloch .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 24]: `` Did you stiffen him with the half brick , then , that you were able to hunt around for a rope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 36]: `` That helped some , but I also remarked that , if he moved , this toy of his would surely go off by accident , and he seemed to think it might hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 12]: McCulloch held the lamp close to the livid , twisted face .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 6]: `` Is this Anatole ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 4]: he said suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said Curtis , with instant appreciation of his adroitness .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 20]: They were rewarded by the scowl which convulsed the mask-like face , and terror set its unmistakable seal there .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 10]: A harsh metallic voice came from the huddled-up form .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 17]: `` Cut this d -- d rope , and let me stand on my feet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 13]: `` There 's no special hurry , '' said the policeman coolly .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 25]: `` We wo n't object to making things more pleasant for you if you promise to take us straight to your Hungarian friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 38]: Again that wave of dread which betokens the quailing heart of the detected felon swept over the man 's features , but he only swore again , and protested that they had no right to torture him .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 22]: McCulloch saw that he had to deal with a hardened criminal , from whom no conscience stricken confession would be forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 19]: He gave the lamp to Curtis , stooped , and lifted the prisoner out on to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 29]: Untying the rope , except at the man 's ankles , he brought the listless hands in front , and placed a pair of handcuffs on the wrists .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 29]: `` Now , '' he said , `` if you have any sense left , you 'll keep quiet and enjoy the ride back to New York . ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 6]: `` Why am I arrested ?
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 8]: I have a right to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 10]: The words were yelped at him rather than spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 8]: `` All in good time , Anatole .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 12]: You 'll have everything explained to you fair and square . ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 7]: `` That is not my name .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 8]: That 's a Frenchman 's name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 15]: `` It fitted you all right in 27th Street a few hours ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 6]: `` I was not there .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 6]: I can prove it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 6]: `` Of course you can .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 13]: You 'd be a poor sort of crook if you could n't .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 6]: But what 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 43]: the roundsman had found some letters and a pocketbook in an inner pocket of the chauffeur 's closely buttoned jacket -- `` M. Anatole Labergerie , care of Morris Siegelman , saloon-keeper , East Broadway , N. Y. , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 25]: `` You know someone named Anatole , anyhow , so we are warm , as the kids say , '' he went on sarcastically .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 5]: `` I say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 4]: I admit nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 14]: I demand the presence of a lawyer , '' was the defiant reply .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 21]: `` You 'll see a heap of lawyers before the State of New York has no further use for you .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 16]: Now , I 'll take you to a nice , quiet hotel for the night .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 8]: In with you ... Mind the step .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 23]: Let me give you a friendly hand ... No , that seat , if you please , close up in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 5]: I 'll go next .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 68]: Mr. Curtis , you do n't object to being squeezed a little , I 'm sure , though the three of us will crowd the back seat , and if the gentleman who says nothing and admits nothing will only change his mind , and tell us exactly how he has spent a rather exciting evening , the story will help pass the journey quite pleasantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 69]: But Anatole Labergerie , whose accent was that of a Frenchman with a very complete knowledge of English , had evidently determined on a policy of silence , and no word crossed his lips during the greater part of the long run to the police station-house in 30th Street , in which precinct , the 23rd , the murder had occurred , and to which McCulloch was attached .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 22]: His presence in the car acted as an effectual damper on conversation in so far as Curtis and Devar were concerned .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 49]: If their suspicions were justified , he was a principal in an atrocious crime , and mere propinquity with such a wretch induced a feeling of loathing comparable only with that shrinking from physical contact to which mankind yields when confronted with leprosy in its final forbidding form .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 5]: But McCulloch was jubilant .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 33]: He regarded his prisoner with the almost friendly interest taken in his quarry by the slayer of wild beasts to whose rifle has fallen some peculiarly rare and dangerous `` specimen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 30]: He enlivened the road with anecdotes of famous criminals , and each story invariably concluded with a facetious reference to the `` chair '' or a `` lifer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 88]: Once or twice he gave details of the breaking up of some notorious gang owing to information extracted from one of its minor members , who , in consequence , either escaped punishment or received a light sentence ; but the captive remained mute and apparently indifferent , whereupon Curtis , who had been revolving in his mind certain elements in a singularly complex mystery , broke fresh ground by saying : `` The strangest feature of this affair is probably unknown to you , Mr. McCulloch .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 38]: To all intents and purposes , the men who killed the journalist were acting in concert with a Frenchman named Jean de Courtois , and their common object was to prevent a marriage arranged for last night .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 21]: Yet this same de Courtois was found gagged and bound in his room at the Central Hotel shortly before midnight .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 17]: Someone had maltreated him badly , and the wonder is he was not killed outright . ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 47]: Now , the roundsman , wedged close against the prisoner , felt the man give an almost unconscious and quite involuntary start when de Courtois was mentioned , and there could be no question that he was straining his ears to catch each syllable Curtis uttered .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 27]: Nudging the latter , McCulloch said : `` So it was a near thing that two weddings were not interfered with last night , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 9]: `` No , not two , only one .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 6]: I married the lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 5]: `` You did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 34]: The policeman 's undoubted bewilderment was convincingly genuine , but , despite his surprise , he was alert to catch the slightest move or sign of emotion on the part of the captive .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 9]: `` I married her before half-past eight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 18]: `` Then you must have possessed some knowledge of the parties mixed up in this business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 12]: `` No , not in the sense you have in mind .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 17]: I can not supply full particulars now , but you will learn them in due course .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 18]: The point I wish to emphasize is this -- poor Mr. Hunter 's death was absolutely needless .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 30]: I imagine he only came into connection with the intrigue by exercising the journalistic instinct to obtain exclusive details of a sensational news item which involved several distinguished people .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 30]: The miserable tools employed by men who wished to gain their own ends were not even true to each other , and they undoubtedly attacked Hunter by error . ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 11]: `` Did they mean to kill you , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 7]: They had never heard of me .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 25]: I dropped from the skies , or the nearest thing to it , since I was on the Atlantic at this hour yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 21]: McCulloch was aware that the Frenchman had been profoundly disturbed by Curtis 's statements , and kept the ball rolling .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 23]: That name , de Courtois , seemed to supply the clew to the man 's agitation , so he harped on it .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 9]: `` Has Mr. Steingall seen de Courtois ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 19]: Mr. Devar and I accompanied him to de Courtois 's room , and set the rascal free . ''
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 11]: `` That settles it , '' said the roundsman emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 22]: `` If the man with the camera eye has looked de Courtois over it is all up with the whole bunch .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 6]: Are you listening , Anatole ?
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 10]: This should be real lively hearing for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 16]: `` Monsieur de Courtois is a friend of mine , '' came the sullen response .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 6]: `` Oh , is he ?
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 14]: Then you do know something about events in 27th Street , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 19]: `` I tell you nothing , but why should I deny that I know Monsieur de Courtois ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 14]: `` Or that you are a Frenchman , '' put in Curtis quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 34]: `` One of the few words in the French language which no foreigner can ever pronounce is that word ` Monsieur , ' especially when it is followed by a ` de . '
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 11]: I speak French well enough to realize my limitations . ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 14]: `` Now , Anatole , cough it up , '' said McCulloch jocularly .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 20]: `` You 've no more chance of winning through than a chunk of ice in hell 's flames . ''
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 41]: `` Let me alone , I 'm tired , '' said the other , relapsing into a stony inattention which did not end even when Brodie brought the car to a stand outside the police station-house in West 30th Street .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 17]: The advent of the roundsman with a prisoner and escort created some commotion among his colleagues .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 30]: The police captain was the same official who had harbored suspicion against Curtis not so many hours ago , and his opinion was not entirely changed , only modified .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 22]: He glanced darkly at Curtis and Devar , but was manifestly cheered by sight of McCulloch with a chauffeur in custody .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 4]: `` Hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 15]: he cried , `` and where in Hades have _ you _ been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 15]: `` A long way from home , Mr. Evans , '' said the roundsman .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 7]: `` But it was worth while .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 21]: This is Anatole , whose other name is Labergerie , the man wanted for the murder in 27th Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 6]: `` The deuce it is !
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 7]: Where did you get him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 7]: `` Away up beyond Yonkers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 7]: `` Hold on a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 13]: He swung round quickly to a telephone , and called up Headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 14]: `` Hello , there , '' he said , when an answer came .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 8]: `` Mr. Steingall or Mr. Clancy in ?
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 2]: Both ?
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 12]: Well , put me through ... That you , Mr. Steingall ?
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 37]: I 'm Evans , 23rd precinct ... Sergeant McCulloch has just arrived with a prisoner , the chauffeur , Anatole ; and Mr. Curtis is here , too ... Anatole Labergerie is the full name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 4]: Some conversation followed .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 26]: The others could hear the peculiar rasping sound of a voice otherwise undistinguishable , but it was evident that the police captain was greatly puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 7]: At last he beckoned to Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 10]: `` You 're wanted , '' he said laconically .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 16]: Curtis went to the instrument , and Steingall 's rather amused tone was soon explicable .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 13]: `` There 's a screw loose , somewhere , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 8]: `` Anatole Labergerie is a respectable garage-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 5]: I know him well .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 61]: Half an hour ago I called him out of bed , chiefly on account of his front name , and he told me that Mr. Hunter hired a car from him last evening , but never showed up at the appointed place and time , and the chauffeur brought the car back to the garage to wait further orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 38]: `` I have no wish to traduce Anatole Labergerie , '' said Curtis , `` but I am quite sure that the man under arrest is the driver of the car in which the Hungarians made off .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 15]: He has admitted , too , that Jean de Courtois is his friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 12]: A low whistle revealed Steingall 's revised view of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 10]: `` Do n't go away , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 17]: `` Clancy and I will be with you in less than quarter of an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 12]: Curtis hung up the receiver , and announced the new development .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 10]: The Frenchman did not betray any cognizance of it .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 15]: He had collapsed into a chair , and looked the degenerate that he was .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 8]: But Devar slapped McCulloch 's broad shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 8]: `` Did n't I tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 13]: `` There 's a whole lot of night ahead of us yet .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 3]: Gee whizz !
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 13]: I 'll write a book before I 'm through with this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 61]: CHAPTER XIII WHEREIN LADY HERMIONE `` ACTS FOR THE BEST '' A dejected and disheveled super-clerk was called on to face a new crisis soon after he had apparently got rid of most of the persons concerned in the pandemonium which had raged for hours around that refuge of middle-class decorum and respectability , the Central Hotel in 27th Street .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 38]: As he was wont to explain in later days of blessed peacefulness : `` The queerest part of the whole business was that I never had the slightest notion as to what was going to happen next .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 21]: Everything occurred like a flash of lightning , and imitated lightning by never striking twice in the same place . ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 45]: It was not to be expected that a man of the Earl of Valletort 's social standing and experience would allow himself to be brow-beaten by a police official and an uncertain miscellany of people like Devar and the members of the Curtis family .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 38]: When the cool night air had tempered his indignation , and he was removed from the electrical atmosphere created by his son-in-law 's positive disdain and Steingall 's negative indifference , he began to survey the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 33]: Though not wholly a stranger in New York , he was far from being versed in the technicalities of legal and police methods , so he bethought him of securing skilled advice .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 24]: The hour was late , but the fact merely presented a difficulty which was not insuperable to a person of even average intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 20]: He turned into an imposing looking hotel on Broadway , produced his card , and asked for the manager .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 61]: An affable clerk hurried forward , thinking that his house was about to earn new laurels ; if somewhat surprised by the Earl 's explanation that he was in need of a lawyer of repute , and had applied to the proprietor of an important hotel as one most likely to further the quest , he responded with prompt civility .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 20]: `` There are several lawyers guests in the hotel at this moment , my lord , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 14]: `` Each is a notable man in one branch of practice or another .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 25]: May I ask if you want advice in a matter of real estate , or some commercial claim , or a criminal charge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 13]: `` The latter , in a sense , '' said the Earl .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 25]: `` A relative of mine has contracted a marriage under conditions which are illegal , or , at any rate , most irregular . ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 6]: The clerk stroked his chin .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 18]: `` Mr. Otto Schmidt has just concluded a remarkable nullity of marriage suit , '' he pondered .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 8]: `` Just the man for my purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 5]: Is he in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 18]: Within five minutes the Earl was closeted with Mr. Otto Schmidt in the latter 's private sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 17]: The lawyer was a short man , who bore a remarkable physical resemblance to an egg .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 58]: Head , rotund body , and immensely fat legs tapering to very small feet , formed a complete oval , while his ivory-tinted skin , and a curious crease running round forehead and ears beneath a scalp wholly devoid of hair , suggested that the egg had been boiled , and the top cut off and replaced .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 12]: But he showed presently that the ovum was sound in quality .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 13]: He listened in absolute silence until his lordship had told his story .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 10]: All things considered , the recital was essentially true .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 75]: There were suppressions of fact , such as the lack of any mention of collusion between the distraught father and Count Ladislas Vassilan on the one hand and Jean de Courtois on the other , and there were wholly unwarrantable imputations against Curtis 's character and attributes , but , on the whole , Mr. Schmidt was able , in his own phrase , `` to size up the position '' with fair accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 27]: Like every other man of common sense who became acquainted with the night 's doings in a connected narrative , he began by expressing his astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 53]: `` I have had some singular cases to handle during a long and varied professional career , '' he said , and eyelids almost devoid of lashes dropped for an instant over a pair of dark and curiously piercing eyes , `` but I have never heard of anything quite like this .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 32]: You say the name of the detective who gave you the account of the murder , and of the connection of this John Delancy Curtis with it , is Steingall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 81]: Again the eyelids fell , and , as Mr. Schmidt 's face was also devoid of eyebrows , and was colorless in its pallor , and as his lips met in a thin seam above a chin which merged in folds of soft flesh where his neck ought to be , his features at such a moment assumed the disagreeable aspect of a death mask , though this impression vanished when those brilliant eyes peered forth from their bulbous sockets .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 10]: `` But I know Steingall , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 37]: `` He is at the head of the New York Detective Bureau , a man of the highest reputation , and one who commands confidence in the courts , not to speak of his department . ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 38]: `` He struck me as an able man , but I am quite sure he has failed to appreciate the share this fellow , Curtis , has borne in the affair , '' said the Earl testily .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 30]: `` It seems to me that your daughter , Lady Hermione , could not possibly have been what is commonly described as ` in love ' with de Courtois ?
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 15]: Stupid as the comment may appear , I must search for a motive . ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 10]: `` My good sir , the notion is preposterous .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 66]: I -- I have reason to believe that she intended this marriage to serve as a shield , or cloak , for her own purposes , which were , I regret to say , largely inspired by a stubborn resolve not to marry a man who is suitable as a husband in every way -- by birth , social position , and distinguished prospects . ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 5]: `` Her own purposes .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 7]: What does that mean exactly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 15]: `` It means that she was contracting a marriage as a matter of form .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 43]: Do n't you see that this consideration , and this alone , made it possible for an impertinent outsider like Curtis to offer his services as de Courtois 's substitute , while my misguided daughter was equally prepared to accept them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 26]: The eyelids shut tightly once more , and the Earl , feeling rather irritated and disturbed by this unpleasing habit , shifted his chair noisily .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 49]: He found , however , that Mr. Schmidt merely kept the shutters down for a rather longer period than before , and , as the lawyer impressed him with a sense of power and ability , he resolved to put up with a peculiarity which was certainly disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 21]: `` May I ask if your daughter is what is popularly known as a pretty girl , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 4]: demanded Schmidt suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 16]: She is remarkably good-looking , but -- '' `` Motive , my lord , motive .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 12]: I was wondering why Curtis should behave like a thundering idiot .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 18]: Now , apart from your natural dislike to the man , how would you describe him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 26]: `` He looks a gentleman , and , under ordinary conditions , I would regard him as a social equal , '' admitted the Earl .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 24]: `` So , unfortunate as the circumstances may be , he is a more desirable _ parti _ than the French music-master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 8]: Then the noble lord flared into heat .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 6]: `` Dash it all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 11]: `` You are almost as bad as that detective person .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 24]: I am not bothering my brains as to Curtis 's desirableness or otherwise , or comparing him with a worm like de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 6]: I want this marriage annulled .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 5]: I want him arrested .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 19]: I want the aid of the law to extricate my daughter from the consequences of her own folly .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 11]: Surely , such a marriage can not be legal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 18]: Schmidt weighed the point from behind the veil , and an unemotional reply soothed his fiery client .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 40]: `` The idea is , perhaps , untenable -- almost repulsive , '' he said , `` but the law on the matter is governed by so many differing decisions that I can not express a reasoned opinion offhand .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 9]: You see , the question of consideration intervenes .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 11]: And -- and -- where is the lady now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 10]: `` You left Curtis at the Central Hotel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 16]: `` In company with Steingall , and two elderly Curtises , and young Devar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 13]: `` Why did n't you demand your daughter 's present address ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 26]: `` I -- I was so stunned by what I regarded as official sanction of an outrage that I came away in a fury . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 24]: Mr. Otto Schmidt rose , or rather , raised his oblong shape from a slight incline on a chair to a horizontal position .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 12]: `` Let us go to the hotel , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 9]: `` And there must be no more fury .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 41]: Leave the inquiry in my hands , my lord , and it will be strange if I do not succeed in elucidating points which are now baffling us -- in fact , I may say , inducing mental disturbance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 40]: Thus , it came to pass that Krantz , the reception clerk at the Central Hotel , had just seen the doctor sent to dose de Courtois with bromide leaving the building when the Earl and Mr. Schmidt entered .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 44]: As it happened , the lawyer was known to him , Schmidt having had legal charge of the corporation which reconstructed the hotel , so it was impossible for an employé to be reticent with him about the matters which were discussed forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 6]: `` Mr. Steingall gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 4]: inquired Schmidt affably .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 31]: He left here nearly half an hour ago , '' said the clerk , outwardly self-possessed , but wondering inwardly what new bomb would be exploded in his weary brain .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 20]: `` This murder , and its attendant circumstances , constitute a very extraordinary affair , '' said the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 5]: Krantz was not deceived .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 37]: He had answered some such remark a hundred times that evening , but he would surely be put on the rack in a moment by some fantastic disclosure which none save a lunatic would dream of .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 34]: `` Now , about this Mr. John Delancy Curtis , '' purred Schmidt , `` has it been ascertained beyond all doubt that he arrived in New York from Europe this evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 13]: `` I think so , sir , '' was the jaded answer .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 23]: `` The police are satisfied on that point , I believe , and he himself gave his last address as Pekin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 4]: `` Pekin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 10]: Everybody was invariably astonished when they heard of Pekin .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 23]: Had Curtis described his recent residence as `` the Moon '' it would have been regarded as only a degree more recondite .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 39]: `` Then , '' said Schmidt , closing his eyes , `` assuming he is the stranger he represents himself as being , he could have no personal connection with the murder of Monsieur Jean de Courtois ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 8]: Another comet had fallen in 27th Street .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 11]: Krantz winced , as if the lawyer had struck him .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 6]: `` Mr. de Courtois ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 7]: `` Who says he was murdered ?
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 30]: He is -- not very well , it is true , but for all that I can tell , he is sound asleep in bed at this minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 5]: `` Sound asleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 28]: roared the Earl , who had been most positive in his opinion that Curtis must have brought about the Frenchman 's death for his own fell purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 12]: Otto Schmidt laid a restraining hand on his lordship 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 8]: `` Steady now , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 5]: `` Remember my instructions .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 11]: The inquiry is committed to me for the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 25]: `` But , confound it , man -- '' `` Yes , this is startling , this changes the whole aspect of the case .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 12]: But you see the value of calm and judicious method . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 47]: The egg-shaped man was certainly entitled to take credit for the disclosure , and seldom failed to do so in many subsequent expositions to admiring friends of a singular case , but he never realized how thoroughly self-deluded the Earl had been by the original blunder .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 23]: `` But , sir , '' protested the clerk , `` it was never supposed that Mr. de Courtois had been killed .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 33]: No one knew who the poor gentleman was at first , because Mr. Curtis 's overcoat and his had been accidently exchanged in the flurry and excitement after the crime was committed .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 32]: The police found the initials H. R. H. on his clothing , and that fact led to his being recognized as Mr. Henry R. Hunter , a well-known New York journalist .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 28]: Had I seen him myself , I would have settled that point in a moment , because he often came here to visit Mr. de Courtois . ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 10]: That is very interesting , most decidedly interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 13]: `` Are you quite certain that what you are saying is correct ?
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 15]: Mr. Hunter , the murdered man , was acquainted with Monsieur de Courtois ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 35]: The question came from the Earl of Valletort , whose angry bewilderment had suddenly given place to a gravity of demeanor that was significant of the serious complications involved in the clerk 's statement .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 13]: Poor Krantz could have bitten his tongue for its too free wagging .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 27]: He was thoroughly tired , and had intended to go to his room at the earliest moment and repair damages by a long night 's rest .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 15]: Now , to all appearance , he had unwittingly reopened the whole wretched imbroglio .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 8]: But there was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 15]: Having put his hand to the plow he was obliged to turn the furrow .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 15]: `` Yes , my lord , positive , '' he said between his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 19]: Schmidt was beginning to think that the amazing marriage promised to develop into a _ cause célèbre _ .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 30]: `` In that event , it becomes essential , indeed , I may say imperative , that his lordship and I should interview Monsieur de Courtois without delay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 39]: `` Sorry , sir , '' said the clerk , desperately availing himself of the detective 's instructions , `` but Mr. Steingall left orders that no one should be permitted to visit Mr. de Courtois to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 4]: `` Left orders ?
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 8]: Is the man in this hotel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 20]: `` Oh , yes , I was aware of that all the time , '' put in the Earl .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 27]: `` He lived here -- do n't you see , that accounts for the mistake I made in assuming that -- '' `` Forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 15]: The lawyer 's monitory hand rose again , and he turned to the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 26]: `` You can hardly expect me , Mr. Krantz , to regard Mr. Steingall 's ` orders ' as in any way controlling my actions .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 16]: Kindly show his lordship and me to Monsieur de Courtois 's room at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 9]: There was nothing for it but to obey .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 36]: Krantz understood exactly how he would be jumped on and pulverized in the morning by irate stockholders in the hotel if any action of his should be adversely reported on by the great Otto Schmidt .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 10]: But the visit to de Courtois fizzled out unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 35]: The Frenchman , still attired in evening dress , for that is the conventional wedding attire of his race , was lying on the bed sleeping the sleep of utter exhaustion supplemented by bromide .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 37]: The two negro attendants , who were hoping for some more exciting experience , were squatted on the floor playing pinochle , and the strenuous efforts of Lord Valletort to arouse the slumberer were quite useless .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 39]: But -- and that was a vital thing -- he had seen de Courtois , and knew beyond doubt that he was alive , and seemingly in good health , or , at any rate , physically uninjured .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 23]: `` The man has been drugged , '' said the lawyer , watching the Earl 's unavailing attempt to awaken the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 17]: `` Is , by any chance , Mr. Curtis 's room situated near this one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 11]: `` It is just overhead , '' said the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 15]: Schmidt looked up at the ceiling as though his eyes might discern a trap-door .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 8]: `` Is Mr. Curtis there now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 6]: `` Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 10]: `` He went out with a Mr. Devar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 9]: Do you know where he went to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 16]: Krantz was tempted to prevaricate , but Schmidt was a power in the Central Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 13]: `` I believe , sir , he is at the Plaza . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 14]: `` A large hotel , near Central Park , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 5]: demanded the Earl eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 8]: `` My lord , pardon me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 34]: The lawyer was no believer in letting all the world into your secrets , and the clerk 's manner showed that he was far from well posted in certain elements of the affair .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 19]: Valletort was for rushing forthwith off in a taxi to the Plaza ; but Schmidt vetoed the notion .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 44]: He shared the Earl 's conviction that Hermione would be discovered there , but , before meeting her , he wanted to obtain a great many particulars the lack of which in his client 's earlier story his legal acumen had already scented .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 37]: So he drew the impatient nobleman into a quiet corner of the restaurant , and extracted from his unwilling lips certain details as to Count Vassilan and the marriage project which had not been forthcoming before .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 24]: Krantz seized the opportunity to call up Steingall on the telephone and told him something , not all , of what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 58]: He did not say that the Earl and Schmidt had actually seen de Courtois , and suppressed any mention of his disclosure with reference to Curtis 's whereabouts , not that he wished to mislead the detective willfully , but he felt that he had been indiscreet , and there was no need to proclaim the fact .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 32]: Moreover , he had never heard Hermione 's name mentioned , or he was gallant enough to have risked any trouble next day if a lady would be saved distress thereby .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 16]: Schmidt 's lawyer-like caution was destined to have far-reaching effects on the night 's history .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 28]: It provided one of the minor rills of a torrent which was gaining irresistible momentum , and would submerge many people before its uncontrolled madness was exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 41]: Had he yielded to the Earl , and hurried to the Plaza at once , he would have met Curtis and Steingall there , and those two men might have diverted the bursting current of events into a new channel .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 14]: But , naturally enough , he wanted to understand precisely where he stood .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 22]: In a word , the egg was excellent in its constituents , but lacked the exuberant freshness of the newly-laid article .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 67]: Hence , while the Earl nearly choked with indignation at sight of that entry in the visitors ' book at the Plaza -- `` Mr. and Lady Hermione Curtis , Pekin , '' -- mistress and maid were once more discussing the astounding things which had taken place since the moment when John Delancy Curtis rang the bell at Flat 10 in Number 1000 59th Street .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 13]: `` If only I knew how to act for the best ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 5]: wailed Hermione half tearfully .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 29]: `` I am afraid , Marcelle , I have been too egotistical , too much concerned about myself , I mean , and far too regardless of others .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 32]: I have allowed Mr. Curtis to place himself in a dreadful position -- '' `` I 'm sure , miladi , he does n't think so , '' interrupted Marcelle breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 13]: `` That is the worst feature of it , to my thinking .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 8]: He is making all the sacrifice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 10]: To get a wife like you , miladi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 10]: `` I am _ not _ his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 108]: `` Well , you are not married like folk who go away for a honeymoon and find rice in their clothes every day for a week , but Mr. Curtis says , miladi , that you are his wife right enough in the eyes of the law , and I 'm sure he admires you immensely already , so there 's no telling -- '' `` Marcelle , do you imagine for one single instant that I would really marry any man who took me as a favor , who conferred an obligation on me , who came to my assistance in a moment of despair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 12]: `` No , miladi , not if he thought those things .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 51]: But I have a sort of notion that Mr. Curtis would hurt any other man who suggested any of them , and it is easy to see by the very way he looks at you -- '' `` Oh , have pity , and do n't harp on that string !
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 7]: I can be nothing to him .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 26]: You mistake his kindness for something which is so utterly impossible that it almost drives me to hysteria to hear it even spoken of . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 4]: Marcelle knew better .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 33]: In some recess of her own acute mind she felt that Lady Hermione 's heightened color and shining eyes were due to just that wild and irresponsible conceit which they were debating .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 10]: Indeed , Hermione could not leave the topic alone .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 29]: She forbade it , rejected it , stormed at its folly , yet came back to it like a child held spellbound by some terrifying yet fascinating object .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 54]: The maid was racking her brain for some feminine argument which should convince an impulsive mistress that Curtis might reasonably regard his matrimonial entanglement as by no means so incapable of a satisfactory outcome as his `` wife '' deemed it , when a knock at the door of the sitting-room alarmed both .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 48]: And , indeed , the ever-present dread which haunted them was justified , because a page announced `` The Earl of Valletort and Mr. Otto Schmidt , '' and before the petrified Marcelle could utter a word of protest , the two men were in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 27]: Marcelle said afterwards that no incident of those tumultuous hours surprised her more than the way in which Lady Hermione received her unbidden and unwelcome visitors .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 71]: The instant before their arrival she was an irresponsible and doubting and vacillating girl , torn by emotion , and swayed hither and thither by gusts of perplexity which ranged from half-formed hope to blank despair , but now she came from her bedroom without a second 's hesitancy , and faced her father and the lawyer with a proud serenity which obviously disconcerted them , and quite dumfounded Marcelle .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 4]: At last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 23]: said the Earl , trying to speak complacently , but failing rather badly , because his attitude and words were decidedly melodramatic .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 6]: `` And too late ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 27]: said his daughter , letting her fine eyes dwell on Schmidt with the contemplative scrutiny she might bestow on an exhibit in a natural history museum .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 20]: `` Pardon me , your ladyship , not too late , but just in time , I fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 21]: Otto Schmidt met her gaze without flinching , and he was a man who undoubtedly commanded attention when he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 7]: His tone was deferential but decisive .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 15]: His black eyes were taking in this charming and intelligent woman in full measure .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 26]: Her rare beauty , her unstudied pose , her slender elegance , the quiet harmonies of her costume -- each and all made their appeal .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 27]: He even waited for her reply , compelling it by some subtle transference of the knowledge that he would not endeavor to browbeat or misunderstand her .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 17]: `` I have heard your name , but may I ask why you are here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 4]: she said composedly .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 15]: It pleased him to find that he had not erred by underrating her intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 13]: `` A very proper question , Lady Hermione , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 30]: `` I am a lawyer , fairly well known in New York , and your father has consulted me with reference to the marriage you have contracted to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 23]: `` Since , as you say , the marriage has most certainly been contracted , the statement hardly explains your presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 38]: He smiled , and Lord Valletort , who had not seen Otto Schmidt smile once during the past hour , discovered that he had not begun to appraise his new ally 's qualities at their due worth .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 18]: `` It is a legal habit to state events in their order , '' he replied suavely .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 13]: `` But these are matters which we ought to discuss privately . ''
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 37]: `` No , Marcelle , do not go , '' said Hermione , hiding her fear under an assumption of icy indifference , and checking the maid 's movement in response to the lawyer 's hint .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 27]: `` Marcelle Leroux is fully in my confidence , '' she explained , `` and you can say nothing which she may not listen to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 20]: `` I am obliged to your ladyship , but I had to mention her presence , '' said Schmidt .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 32]: `` Well , I am sorry to be the bearer of unpleasant news , but you were inveigled into a marriage ceremony with John Delancy Curtis by gross and fraudulent misrepresentation .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 15]: He told you , I assume , that Monsieur Jean de Courtois was dead .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 5]: That is not true .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 21]: Monsieur de Courtois is alive , and in his room at the Central Hotel in 27th Street at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 33]: He was detained there at the hour you awaited him -- kept there forcibly , by means which must be investigated , but the really important fact now is that he lives .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 9]: Need I tell you what that statement implies ?
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 14]: Need I emphasize the lie with which this man Curtis attained his object ?
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 19]: Your father , the Earl , and I myself , saw Jean de Courtois a few minutes since .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 12]: Probably , and not without reason , you doubt my word .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 28]: If that is so , will you kindly use the telephone yourself , ring up the Central Hotel , and ask if Monsieur de Courtois is there ?
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 19]: You will hardly imagine that the hotel staff would enter into a conspiracy with us to deceive you .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 10]: Again , you might send for the manager here .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 24]: He knows me , and will assure you that I am not a person who would lend himself to subterfuge or falsehood . ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 12]: `` But some man was killed , was he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 55]: Hermione 's lips had whitened , but her courage was superb , though her poor heart was like to burst with its frenzied throbbing , for she was certain this self-possessed man was speaking truly , and , if he were , her hero with the head of gold had revealed feet of clay .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 11]: `` Yes , unhappily , a journalist named Hunter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 5]: Schmidt was an artist .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 8]: He knew when to use few words .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 11]: `` But Mr. Curtis himself may have been deceived . ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 16]: `` Mr. Curtis was among those who pretended to liberate de Courtois from his bonds .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 29]: Your unfortunate friend was brutally tied and gagged in his room in the hotel , and is now recovering from the effects of the maltreatment he received . ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 23]: `` Mr. Curtis could n't have known of this when he was here , little more than half an hour ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 8]: `` He knew it two hours ago .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 10]: Not only he , but Mr. Steingall knew it .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 8]: Did neither of them tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 28]: In utter despair , broken-hearted now not by reason of her own plight , but rather because of a shattered faith , Hermione appealed to the Earl .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 8]: `` Father , is this true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 7]: `` Absolutely true , every syllable .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 19]: I really think you ought to confirm Mr. Schmidt 's statement by inquiry at the Central Hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 9]: `` And publish my unhappy story more widely !
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 8]: ... Will you kindly leave me now ?
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 8]: I must think , and act . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 30]: `` One word , your ladyship , and I have done , '' said the lawyer , speaking with a slow seriousness that could not fail to be convincing .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 10]: `` The mischief is not irreparable -- at present .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 7]: But you must not remain here .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 50]: You are registered in the books of the hotel as the wife of John Delancy Curtis , and , if I may say it with respect , your own sense of what is right and proper will forbid the notion that you can abide in the hotel until to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 40]: I pledge my reputation that it will immensely facilitate the legal steps necessary to secure the annulment of the marriage if you dissever yourself from your so-called husband at the earliest moment after you have discovered his tort . ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 35]: Hermione was not the type of woman who faints in an emergency , though gladly now would she have found in unconsciousness a respite from the bitter pain that was rending her innermost fiber .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 12]: `` I think -- I understand , '' she said brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 7]: `` Will you please go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 12]: `` But will you not come with me , Hermione ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 4]: said her father .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 15]: `` I give you my word of honor there will be no recriminations . ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 18]: `` I must be alone -- to-night , '' she cried , flaring into a passionate vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 10]: `` Marcelle and I will return to my apartment .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 6]: You know where it is .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 35]: Come there in the morning , at any hour you choose , but go now , this instant , or I shall refuse to leave the hotel , no matter what the consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 27]: Her voice rose almost to a scream , and Schmidt , a profound student of human nature , realized that any extra pressure would be fatal .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 4]: He had succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 39]: This girl would keep her promise , of that he was well assured , but if her high-strung temperament was subjected to undue force she would put her back against the wall and defy law and convention alike .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 28]: `` Come , '' he said to the Earl , and , with a courteous bow to Hermione , he literally pulled her father from the room .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 5]: Hermione did not weep .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 17]: She was done with tears , sick with vain regret , yet braced to unfaltering purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 27]: The instant the door was closed she picked up the telephone , and the wretched Krantz was soon in evidence to verify the lawyer 's words .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 35]: Marcelle was crying as though she had lost a lover or some dear relative ; when Hermione bade her prepare for their departure , she gave no heed , but wailed her sorrow aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 14]: `` I d-don ' t believe them , miladi , '' she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 26]: `` Mr. Curtis -- will wring the lawyer-man 's neck -- to-morrow ... I know he will ... Did Mr. Curtis kill poor Mr. Hunter ?
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 10]: If not , why should he tie that Frenchman ?
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 16]: ... And would n't he t-tie twenty Frenchmen if he w-wanted to m-marry you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 27]: Hermione stooped and fondled the girl 's shoulders , for Marcelle had collapsed to her knees on the hearth-rug while her mistress was using the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 28]: `` You have been my very good friend , Marcelle , '' she said , and the misery in her voice subjugated the maid 's louder grief .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 12]: `` Do n't fail me now , there 's a dear !
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 26]: I want to write a letter , and there can be no question whatever that you and I must get away before Mr. Curtis returns .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 10]: Do n't fret , or lose faith in Providence .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 21]: A great man once wrote : ` God 's in Heaven , and all 's well with the world . '
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 21]: You and I must try to believe that , and place utmost trust in its promise ... There , now !
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 12]: Hurry , and I shall join you in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 21]: We shall send for our baggage in the morning , and so avoid attracting attention in the hotel to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 24]: Brave as she was , when left alone in the room she pressed her hands to her face in sheer abandonment of agony .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 12]: But the storm passed , and she sat down to write .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 27]: CHAPTER XIV THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING Evans , the police captain of the 23rd Precinct , had a fairly long story to hear from McCulloch .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 10]: The roundsman did not spare himself in the recital .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 9]: He pleaded guilty to three errors of judgment .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 89]: In the first instance , he would have done well had he taken the advice given by Devar during the halt at 42nd Street , and arrested the supposed `` Anatole '' then and there ; secondly , he might have secured corroborative evidence of the cleansing of parts of the automobile -- evidence now destroyed by the waters of the Hudson ; and , thirdly , he should have asked Brodie to intercept the fugitive long before it became possible to plunge the car into the river .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 21]: `` All I can say is , I sized up the situation and acted accordingly , '' he commented ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 44]: `` It did look like a good plan to give him rope enough '' -- here he checked his utterance , and glanced at the disconsolate prisoner -- `` but he fairly got the better of me when I went aboard that barge .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 14]: I ought to have left one of these gentlemen to watch the quay .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 32]: My excuse is that the barge seemed to offer the only probable hiding-place , and there was always the chance that he had gone into the river with the car . ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 21]: `` Anyhow , you got him , '' observed Evans sympathetically , for McCulloch was a valued and trustworthy officer .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 22]: `` Well , he 's here , but Mr. Brodie got him , '' whereupon Brodie tried not to look sheepish .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 24]: Steingall and Clancy arrived before the roundsman had made an end of his experiences , which he had to recount for their benefit .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 9]: The two detectives had resumed their ordinary clothing .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 22]: They looked tired , but quietly elated , and it was noticeable that Clancy 's mercurial spirits seemed to have evaporated .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 36]: Those who knew him would have augured from that fact that the chase was reaching its climax , but Curtis and Devar fancied that the little man was thoroughly worn out and pining for rest .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 8]: Never had they been more egregiously deceived .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 31]: He resembled a hound which bays its excitement when the quarry is scented but restrains all its energies for the last desperate struggle when the flying prey is in sight .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 55]: The Frenchman sat as though in a stupor , and seemingly gave no attention to the details of the hunt , but he sprang to his feet in sheer fright when Steingall walked up to him and said sternly : `` Now , Antoine Lamotte , listen to what I have to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 8]: `` I am betrayed , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 31]: snarled the man viciously , though his voice went off into a curious yelp of agony as a twinge reminded him of Brodie 's vigorous aim with half a brick .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 8]: `` Yes , the game is up .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 22]: I know your confederates , and you will be confronted with them before daybreak ... No , I am not bluffing .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 6]: That is not my way .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 9]: Their names are Gregor Martiny and Ferdinand Rossi .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 6]: Now are you satisfied ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 7]: Lamotte sank back into his chair .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 20]: His features were wrung with pain , but the momentary excitement vanished , and his manner grew sullen again .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 16]: `` If you know so much I can tell you nothing , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 14]: You can give me little or no information I do not possess already .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 23]: But , unless you are more fool than knave , you can at least try to save your own miserable life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 6]: `` By a full confession .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 14]: Did you know that Martiny and Rossi meant to kill Mr. Hunter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 8]: `` No , I swear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 14]: `` Then why do n't you take the hint I have given you ?
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 13]: It will be too late when you are brought before a judge .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 13]: Believe me , I shall waste no more breath in persuading you .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 7]: It is now or never . ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 10]: The Frenchman rose again , this time more slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 22]: He glanced around at the ring of faces , and , for a moment , his gaze dwelt contemplatively on Clancy .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 23]: Perhaps he was vouchsafed some intuition that this man was to be feared , but Clancy remained unemotional as a Sioux Indian .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 37]: When he spoke , it was with a certain dignity , and , oddly enough , his words , though uttered in English , savored of a literal translation from the French mint which coined them .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 22]: `` Monsieur , '' he said , `` I am a man who regards loyalty to his friends before all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 27]: `` An excellent quality , even in a criminal , if your friends are loyal to you , '' replied Steingall with equal seriousness of manner .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 16]: `` But the woman who betrayed us -- may she be eaten up with cancer !
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 6]: -- is not my friend .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 5]: Those others are . ''
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 8]: `` I have met with no woman .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 31]: I have good reason to think that you have no real notion of the influences which led your Hungarian friends , as you call them , to commit a murder .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 29]: But I rather respect your sentiment , so , to give you one final chance , I tell you now just how you were brought into this thing .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 26]: You are a thief , and the associate of thieves , but you have never , so far as our records go , been convicted .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 48]: Your real name is not Lamotte , though you have passed under it long enough in New York to establish some sort of claim to it , and you were sentenced to two years ' imprisonment at Toulon eight years ago for a breach of military discipline .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 32]: On your release you consorted with anarchists in Paris , and , to escape arrest as a suspect after a dynamite outrage on the Grand Boulevard , you emigrated to America .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 43]: You are a clever mechanic , and , had you tried to earn an honest living , you would have succeeded , but some kink in your nature drove you to crime , mixed up with a good deal of political froth .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 80]: When you heard that precious pair of fanatics , Martiny and Rossi , plotting in Morris Siegelman 's café to prevent a marriage between an English lady of great wealth and a wretched little Frenchman , so that the cause of a Hungarian party might benefit if Count Ladislas Vassilan secured the lady and the money , especially the money , you thought you saw a way towards striking a blow at the Austrian monarchy and also benefiting yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 24]: So you offered your services , and your more acute brain put them up to a dodge they would never have thought of .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 42]: It was necessary for your purpose that you should figure as a respectable man , so you had cards printed in the name of Anatole Labergerie , and addressed letters to yourself under that same name at Morris Siegelman 's restaurant .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 23]: I do not know yet where you obtained the car , but I shall know to-morrow -- the fact is immaterial now .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 94]: What is of real importance is the method whereby you humbugged the janitor at Mr. Hunter 's office by pretending that you had been sent there by Mr. Labergerie because the car was at liberty somewhat earlier than was expected , and the unfortunate journalist took it as a compliment , drove to his rooms , changed his clothes , and returned to the office , thus playing into your hands , because the car sent to his order by Mr. Labergerie was thereby prevented from picking him up at the appointed time .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 60]: It was shrewd of you to guess that a busy man on the staff of a newspaper would be glad to utilize an automobile placed unexpectedly at his disposal , and fate played into your hands by the delay in issuing the duplicate marriage license , which he had promised de Courtois to obtain from the City Hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 12]: `` Sir , I knew nothing of any marriage license . ''
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 4]: `` Probably not .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 21]: You were concerned only with taking your confederates ' money , and posing as the clever brain of the outfit .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 25]: But I imagine , and not another word shall I say , that they overreached you a bit when they knifed Mr. Hunter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 30]: Lamotte , to describe him by the name under which he figured in the annals of the crime , stretched out his hands in a gesture of emphatic protest .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 47]: `` No matter what becomes of me , '' he said eagerly , `` I ask you to believe that I did not even know they had killed Mr. Hunter until I saw the blood on the panel when I took them to Market Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 3]: `` So .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 12]: You have been slow to adopt the lead I offered you .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 14]: But why , in God 's name , did they stab the man ?
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 10]: That could hardly have been their deliberate plan . ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 8]: `` It was a sort of accident .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 4]: So they said .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 14]: They really meant to force him into the car , and overpower him .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 19]: The scheme was to bring him to Market Street and keep him there until -- '' He hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 19]: He had given up hope for himself , but he stopped short of introducing other names into prominence .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 23]: `` Until the _ Switzerland _ had reached New York , with Count Ladislas Vassilan and the English lord on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 4]: Then Lamotte yielded .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 14]: `` You know everything , '' he said , with a dejected shrug .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 16]: `` Either you are a wizard , or Gregor and Rossi are open-mouthed fools . ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 31]: Steingall smiled inscrutably , but Clancy , who had remained strangely quiet , did not relax the close attention he was giving to the Frenchman 's least word or action .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 46]: It was about this time that Curtis noticed the little detective 's air of complete absorption , and he wondered at it , since Clancy and his chief seemed to have unfolded the whole mystery in a way that was at once admirable and bewildering .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 12]: `` Then why do n't you exercise your wits , man ?
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 57]: I have been candor itself in my statement , but it is your own words which will be taken down by the police captain here , as you are charged in his presence with complicity in the murder , and they will be on record for or against you when you are brought to trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 15]: `` You want me to admit that what you have said is true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 13]: `` Just as you wish , '' said Steingall , half contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 16]: `` I now charge you formally with taking part in the murder of Mr. Hunter .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 28]: If you have anything to say , say it , and it will be written at once , and signed by you , if you choose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 10]: He waited a moment , and then turned aside .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 11]: `` Put him in the cells , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 11]: `` I shall not trouble farther about him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 28]: `` One moment , monsieur , '' exclaimed Lamotte , evidently believing that he was seriously jeopardizing his life by not taking the advice given so openly .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 31]: `` I admit that you are well informed , but I must add that I was ignorant of the murder till nearly half an hour after it had occurred . ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 8]: `` Pooh , that 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 11]: Make a full statement , or take the consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 21]: Steingall 's tone was so offhanded that Lamotte was afraid he had lost a good opportunity of saving his neck .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 9]: `` But what is there to tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 12]: `` Just what happened outside the Central Hotel and afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 30]: `` I brought Mr. Hunter there , and nodded to Martiny and Rossi , who were waiting on the sidewalk , to show that he was inside the car .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 27]: I remained at the wheel , and anyone can perceive that my position made it impossible to see what was going on when the door opened .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 23]: Martiny was nearest to me , and I am sure he never used a knife , so it must have been Rossi .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 5]: Is that correct ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 7]: `` I believe so , absolutely .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 4]: What next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 9]: `` Martiny said ` Vite , allez ! '
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 13]: so I shoved in the clutch and made off at top speed .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 65]: In Fifth Avenue I glanced over my shoulder to look at Mr. Hunter , and see whether or not he was struggling , but my friends alone were visible in the back seat , so I believed they had put him on the floor , and did not stop or look at them again until I reached De Silva 's house in Market Street .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 37]: Then , to my annoyance , when I got down to help carry in Mr. Hunter , I found blood on the step and the panel , and the idiots told me what they had done .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 18]: It is only fair to say that De Silva is innocent of any part in the affair .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 36]: He did n't even know that we were bringing anyone to Rossi 's room , and we took care that he should be out at the time we counted on arriving at Market Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 21]: `` You did n't attack Mr. Hunter sooner because your orders were to wait until the last possible moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 6]: `` That is so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 9]: -LSB- Illustration : Scenes from the photo-drama . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 57]: Devar was unaware of any change in the manner of either of the detectives , because he was watching Lamotte 's livid face with a species of fascinated horror , but Curtis , who had often been compelled to hold similar inquiries into cold-blooded crimes committed by Chinese coolies , found greater interest in observing Clancy .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 38]: A subtle exultation had suddenly danced into the diminutive Franco-Irishman 's expressive features when Market Street was first mentioned , and his coal-black eyes blazed in their slits at the sound of that name , De Silva .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 21]: A queer thought flitted through Curtis 's mind , but he put it aside , because Steingall was speaking again .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 10]: `` Well , you got rid of your friends .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 7]: Then what did you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 6]: `` The rest was simple .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 75]: I cleaned the car in a hurry with a bit of oily waste , took it to a yard which I have used at times , at an address which I beg you to permit me to forget , changed the number plate , and , at an hour which I deemed discreet , drove uptown in order to dispose of the car by leaving it deserted near the garage from which it came .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 9]: The owner 's house is on Riverside Drive .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 23]: His name is Morris ; he is absent in Chicago on business , while I learnt that his chauffeur was ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 13]: A gasp of uncontrollable excitement from Devar drew all eyes to him .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 5]: `` Great Jerusalem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 9]: `` Next house to my aunt 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 12]: `` There 's a mistake somewhere , '' broke in Brodie .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 15]: `` I know Mr. Morris 's car , and that is n't it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 13]: Lamotte was positively annoyed that his word should appear to be doubted .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 23]: `` Messieurs , '' he said grandiloquently , `` I assure you on my honor that I am not misleading you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 4]: Nor was he .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 8]: The discrepancy was cleared up next day .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 22]: The Morris automobile was undergoing repairs , and the motor manufacturers had supplied the gray car for use in the interim .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 7]: Steingall swept the matter aside impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 11]: `` Go on , '' he said to the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 10]: `` You 're taking a note of this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 9]: he added , glancing at police captain Evans .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 10]: `` Got it , '' was the laconic reply .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 10]: `` There is nothing else , '' said Lamotte .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 23]: `` I noticed that I was being followed , and soon discovered that I could not shake off a more powerful car .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 30]: I was armed , but did not want to get into trouble on my own account , and I knew that I would have to deal with three men .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 22]: So I decided to throw the car in the river , and trust to my wits for a means of escape .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 21]: I would have succeeded , too , had I been aware that there was a fourth man in the party .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 22]: From where I lay hidden beneath the wharf I could only count the number of people who crossed to the barge .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 16]: I was unable to see them , so I included the chauffeur among the three .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 4]: I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 32]: Perhaps it is as well , because I meant to get away , and would have fought ... That is all ... Will one of you give me a cigarette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 35]: Devar produced a case , and in response to Steingall 's nod , offered its contents to the prisoner , who took two cigarettes ; nor could he be prevailed on to accept more .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 12]: Despite his hang-dog looks he had an undoubted air of refinement .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 26]: Degeneracy had claimed him as its own , yet some streak of a nobler heredity had struggled to exert its influence , only to fail .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 29]: Steingall put no more questions , and Lamotte relapsed into silence , smoking nonchalantly while the police captain 's pen was scratching a transcript of the shorthand notes .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 11]: Curtis caught Steingall 's eye , and drew him aside .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 17]: `` That fellow told the truth about the actual murder , I think '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 11]: `` My story coincides with his in every detail . ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 13]: `` I 'm sure you are right , '' agreed the detective .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 18]: `` The odd thing is that Clancy should have spotted him from your description telephoned to headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 19]: You remember Clancy was looking at a book of photographs when I brought you to the Bureau ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 7]: `` He had found him then .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 30]: Some time since , during the anarchist troubles in Chicago , the French police sent us a lot of pictures , and this fellow 's was among them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 13]: `` Why did n't he ask me if I recognized him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 9]: `` That is not pretty Fanny 's way .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 10]: Clancy never does what any other man would do .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 13]: He hates to have anyone verify an opinion he has once formed .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 27]: Had you said the photograph resembled the man you saw outside the hotel Clancy would actually have begun to believe that he might be mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 40]: `` At any rate , '' said Curtis , smiling , `` you two seem to have made marvelous progress with the inquiry since a set of drunken stokers broke up a harmonious gathering at Morris Siegelman 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 41]: `` We have done pretty well , but this '' -- and Steingall glanced at Lamotte -- `` this goes far beyond anything we hoped for to-night , or this morning , for the new day is growing old . ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 4]: Curtis was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 34]: He realized that the capture of the chauffeur was important , but it shrank into insignificance beside the connected history of events which the detective seemed to have at his fingers ' ends .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 38]: `` I suppose I must not ask questions , '' he said with a quizzical look into the extraordinary eyes which had earned the chief of the Detective Bureau the picturesque description coined by an enthusiastic reporter .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 8]: `` No need , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 30]: `` Unless you are fed up with excitement , I purpose taking you and Mr. Devar down town again , just as soon as Evans has stopped slinging ink .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 13]: Then you will appreciate the importance of the things said here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 34]: Curtis remembered that fleeting impression he had garnered while watching Clancy during the Frenchman 's statement , which , however , appeared only to confirm the ample history already in Steingall 's possession .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 15]: But again his thoughts were diverted from the matter by Steingall 's next words .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 19]: `` I take it you have not called at the Plaza Hotel since we came away together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 28]: `` You certainly could not stop there during the rush after the missing chauffeur , and I suppose McCulloch brought you straight here after the arrest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 33]: We passed the hotel on the outward journey , and I thought I saw a light in -- in my wife 's suite , but we returned by a different route . ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 27]: He fancied that the detective was about to explain a somewhat peculiar question , but at that instant the police captain summoned Lamotte to his desk .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 26]: `` I 'll read what I have written , '' he said , `` and , if it is correct , you will sign it .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 32]: You need not sign unless you wish , but the statement will be given in court , and , if you attest it now , may count in your favor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 21]: He recited an exact record of the Frenchman 's words , and Lamotte took the pen and scrawled his name .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 17]: Then , at a nod from Evans , the roundsman took the prisoner to a cell .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 4]: `` By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 15]: George , or perhaps I ought to say ` By George , Jove ! '
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 25]: you did that well , '' exclaimed Clancy , speaking for the first time since he had entered the station-house , and addressing Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 30]: `` I thought I was going to fail , but I stuck to my guns , and it came off , '' was the modest if rather cryptic reply .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 22]: `` We , too , have fought with beasts at Ephegus , so let us into this , '' cried Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 13]: `` What came off , and where was the risk of failure ?
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 17]: To my mind , you had Lamotte in a double Nelson grip all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 17]: `` That 's where you are in error , young man , '' said Steingall cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 21]: `` Sometimes it pays to pretend a knowledge you do n't possess , and this was one of the occasions .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 20]: Mr. Clancy and I knew that somewhere in New York were two Hungarians named Gregor Martiny and Ferdinand Rossi .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 39]: We knew that they were the men who killed Mr. Hunter , but we had no more notion where they were hiding , or how to lay hands on them , than the man in the moon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 4]: `` Great Scott .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 7]: Have n't you arrested them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 7]: That is a pleasure deferred . ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 15]: `` Do you mean that you wanged that address out of the Frenchman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 9]: `` That 's about the size of it .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 31]: I might have searched for a week for Martiny and Rossi , but no one in East Broadway would have owned up to seeing or even hearing of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 10]: `` Still , you had their names pat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 50]: `` Yes , '' said the detective , cutting the end off a cigar , `` we had their names , and we ascertained why they killed Hunter , or would have killed any other person who tried to balk their scheme , but our information stopped there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 36]: Steingall , usually so communicative , evidently meant to keep to himself the source of his inspiration , and , in a few minutes , Brodie was driving the four men to the Police Headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 16]: They went to the Detective Bureau , and Steingall telephoned the Clinton Street police station-house .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 12]: `` You know De Silva 's place in Market Street ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 41]: `` Well , within ten minutes have half-a-dozen men gather quietly near the door ... Two others should watch the back , and stop anyone making a bolt that way ... Yes , of course , there may be shooting .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 39]: I 'll turn up in a private auto , and stop off at the corner of East Broadway ... Leave the rest to Clancy and myself ... No , only two , but they 're hot stuff . ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 16]: He unlocked a drawer in a desk , and took out a pair of revolvers .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 17]: After examining them to make sure they were fully loaded , he handed one to Clancy .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 21]: `` I hope we shall not require them , Eugene , but there 's no telling , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 23]: `` I suppose I 'm not allowed to shoot anybody , so you might lend me a stick , '' suggested Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 15]: `` You and Mr. Curtis are remaining right here , '' said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 10]: `` Oh , be a man , Steingall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 4]: cried Devar disgustedly .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 15]: `` Do n't play dog when there 's a chance of a real row .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 13]: Look how I swung things your way in Morris Siegelman 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 18]: `` You might let us peep round the corner , at any rate , '' smiled Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 36]: Steingall meant to be obdurate , but yielded , and it was well that he allowed his sympathies to sway his judgment , or there might have been an early vacancy in the chief inspectorship .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 22]: At that middle hour of the night even New York 's prowlers of the dark had retired to their foul rookeries .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 16]: The streets were almost deserted , and the glare of gas and naphtha had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 23]: The houses of the Hungarian quarter were stark and gloomy now , many woe-begone in their semi-dismantled aspect , and all sinister .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 45]: When the automobile drew up noiselessly at the corner of Market Street , a broad enough thoroughfare , but broken and battered in appearance , the only visible forms were those of three or four patrolmen , who were sauntering aimlessly along the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 37]: But there were eyes watching through unknown chinks in shutters , or peering through soiled curtains behind dirt-stained windows , and the quiet concentration of the police in one special quarter evidently did not pass unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 17]: When the battle began , it partook of the vagaries of real warfare by opening unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 22]: It was ascertained afterwards that two men darted like shadows out of a passage in Market Street , and separated instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 39]: One came toward East Broadway , where the detectives and their companions had just alighted from the car , and the other , breaking into a run , dived into Henry Street , with two patrolmen after him .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 26]: He it was who opened the fray , and the peace of the night was suddenly disrupted by the loud bark of an automatic pistol .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 20]: Three shots were fired with a quick irregularity , and then came the deeper report of a service revolver .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 32]: Steingall and Clancy ran forward , and the fugitive coming their way had actually passed them , with two more patrolmen in pursuit , when Steingall saw him and turned instantly .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 25]: The man only increased his pace , and the detective , astonishingly active for one of his bulk , raced along at top speed .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 7]: `` Stop or I shoot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 4]: he cried again .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 12]: By that time the self-confessed outlaw was nearly opposite the car .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 30]: He checked his pace , half turned , luckily not to the side where Curtis and the others were standing , and leveled a Browning pistol at the detective .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 24]: He even hesitated an instant to take aim , but before his finger had pressed the trigger , Curtis had sprung at him .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 37]: There was no time for a blow , but a well placed kick spun the would-be murderer off his feet , and the crash of the shot came an infinitesimal part of a second too late .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 32]: As it was , the bullet struck a lamp higher up the street , and a line taken subsequently showed that it must have missed Steingall by only a few inches .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 9]: The miscreant reeled , and lost his balance .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 44]: Then Curtis closed with him , caught his right wrist , and threw him heavily , but , such was the man 's frenzied resolve not to be arrested , that he fired twice again before the deadly weapon fell from his grasp .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 17]: He did no damage , but the uproar brought a motley crowd from the neighboring dwellings .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 40]: Market Street , which had seemed asleep or dead , proved itself very much alive and awake , but the sight of uniformed police hurrying up from several directions restrained any undue curiosity on the part of its denizens .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 35]: The desperado on the ground was handcuffed at once , and , while a policeman was searching his pockets rapidly to ascertain if he carried another pistol , Steingall gripped Curtis by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 13]: `` I owe you something for that , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 26]: `` I rather fancy he would have dropped me if it had n't been for you ... Oh , I know what I am saying .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 27]: I shall not forget ... Show a light here , '' he added to a patrolman who had run from East Broadway on hearing the shooting .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 12]: `` Now , Mr. Curtis , do you recognize him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 70]: `` Yes , '' said Curtis -- whose experiences in New York were revealing an unsuspected side of his character , for in 56th Street , in Morris Siegelman 's , and now again in Market Street , he had proved himself what Allen Breck would have termed `` a bonnie fighter '' -- `` yes , that is the man who spoke to me in the Central Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 7]: I imagine he is Martiny . ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 7]: Put him in the car ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 9]: The detective rushed off , but soon returned .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 16]: `` Sorry to trouble you , but will you come this way a minute ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 5]: Curtis went with him .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 12]: In Henry Street a small group was gathered in the roadway .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 21]: A policeman had proved himself a better shot than Rossi , and Hunter 's murder was already avenged in part .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 20]: The dead man was left to the district police , to be carried to the mortuary in an ambulance .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 29]: Steingall , with his prisoner , returned to headquarters , while Clancy made a thorough search of the room the pair had occupied in De Silva 's house .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 15]: The Hungarian did not deny his name nor his share in the earlier crime .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 14]: `` It is fate , '' he said doggedly in his broken French .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 18]: `` When they tell me we have killed the man I know the police get us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 6]: He would say no more .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 36]: His words seemed to imply that neither he nor Rossi meant to do other than maim the journalist whom they regarded as de Courtois 's dangerous helper ; but he did not urge the plea .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 22]: Perhaps he felt that when a Hungarian uses a knife , a trifling error in the matter of direction is pardonable .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 26]: `` I shall not go home now , '' said Steingall , bidding farewell to his allies when Martiny had been formally identified and charged .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 24]: `` I must get this thing thoroughly straightened out before morning , though the inquest and police court proceedings will be mere adjournments .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 5]: Good-night , Mr. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 5]: Good-night , Mr. Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 6]: Once more , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 21]: And , by the way , if all is not well at the Plaza , ` phone me at once .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 6]: Remember , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 3]: Good-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 91]: CHAPTER XV WHEREIN THE PACE SLACKENS -- BUT ONLY FOR A FEW HOURS `` Say , old man , '' muttered Devar , gazing fixedly at Brodie 's broad shoulders as Broadway unrolled its even width before the car on the uptown journey , `` are we the same couple of blighters who met in a bathroom gangway , ` B ' Deck , near staterooms 51 and 52 , on board the Cunard steamship _ Lusitania _ , about twenty-one hours since ; or have we become dematerialized ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 36]: Curtis knew that the boy was quivering with excitement , but it was useless to advise a slackening of the tension , so he merely said : `` Do you feel like a Mahatma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 24]: `` If a Mahatma is a fellow with a head like a balloon , not in size , but in contents , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 34]: Have you ever had a real jag on you , not the big dinner , big bottle , big cigar sort of imitation , but the wild-eyed , imp-seeing , genuine rip-snorter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 5]: Neither have you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 10]: `` I should have denied the charge before to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 8]: But I know now what it means .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 8]: It is a brain-storm induced by rum .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 21]: There are many other varieties , at least fifty-seven , and I 've sampled fifty-six different sorts in nine hours .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 23]: Do you realize that it is just nine hours since I walked into the Central Hotel , and the orchestra struck up ?
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 3]: Good Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 3]: Nine hours !
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 29]: And do you remember , Curtis , I said as we came up the harbor that you would have a hell of a good time in New York ?
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 5]: likewise ho , ho !
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 4]: A good time !
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 18]: Eating , fighting , marrying , plunging neck and crop out of one frantic revel into another .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 54]: Talk about delirium tremens , and its little green devils with little pink eyes -- why , it 's commonplace , that 's what it is -- a poor sort of pipe-dream compared with the reality of life in New York as seen in company with John Delancy Curtis , of Pekin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 44]: Devar was not by any means the first person in the city who had associated the name of the capital of China with some bizarre and elusive element of fantasy in connection with the man who gave `` Pekin '' as his address .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 21]: There was no explaining the conceit ; it was just one of those whimsies which are alike plausible yet enigmatical .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 29]: Had Curtis described himself as being of London , or Paris , or even of Yokohama , no sense of mystery would have attached itself to his personality .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 18]: But , to the world at large , Pekin represents the unknown , and therefore the incongruous .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 32]: It is the Forbidden City , the inner shrine of the East , the symbolic rallying-point of a race which occupies no common ground with the peoples of Europe or America .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 24]: Had Curtis written that he hailed from Lhassa , his legal domicile would have lost its occult extravagance save to the discriminating few .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 42]: The mere mention of Pekin now brought back to Curtis 's mind the last time he had written the word , and , by association of ideas , the queer way in which Steingall had twice alluded to the Plaza Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 8]: He said nothing of this to Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 56]: He thought , and with good reason , that the sooner that young man was in bed and asleep the better it would be for his health , because a mercurial temperament was levying heavy draughts on physical powers , so he gave no hint of the nebulous doubt induced by the detective 's words .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 28]: `` The order of the day is bed for each of us , '' he said , bidding his friend farewell at the door of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 25]: `` Therefore , I shall not offer you any sort of hospitality at this hour , except the kindest one of saying good-by speedily .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 10]: You are coming to lunch , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 4]: `` Lunch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 6]: Devar 's head wagged solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 9]: Feverishly wakeful , he was really half asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 9]: `` Do n't talk to me of lunch .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 32]: You have n't had breakfast yet , John D. New York will keep you busy yet awhile , or I do n't size her up right ... Good old New York !
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 6]: Is n't she a peach ?
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 5]: Well , so long !
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 8]: If you want me , ` phone .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 15]: I 'll pull a couch under the instrument and sleep with my clothes on .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 16]: If I shove my head beneath a tap I 'll be as right as rain .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 5]: Home , Arthur . ''
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 16]: Then Curtis entered the hotel , and a night-porter took him up in the elevator .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 25]: When he opened the door of Suite F. its tiny lobby was in darkness , but the lights in the sitting-room were switched on .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 24]: Evidently , then , neither he nor Devar was mistaken in identifying those illuminated windows when the chase led them past the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 52]: But he was struck instantly by the fact that the door leading to Hermione 's room was wide open , and , before he could assimilate this singular fact , he saw a note lying on a small table just where it must catch his eye on entering his own bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 28]: Curtis was no soothsayer , but he was endowed with a penetrating and usually accurate judgment , and he knew at once that Hermione had left him .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 38]: Although he had only seen her handwriting when she signed the register at the clergyman 's house he recognized the same free , well-formed characters in the `` John Delancy Curtis , Esq. '' on the envelope .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 32]: He paled , perhaps , and a pang of a pain crueller than bodily ill may have wrung his heart , but he hesitated not a second about opening the letter .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 27]: Then he read : `` DEAR MR. CURTIS : -- My father has been here , and with him a Mr. Otto Schmidt , a lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 22]: They told me that Jean de Courtois is alive , and that you know it , and have known it throughout .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 46]: Gladly would I have refused to believe them , but , sometimes , there are statements which can not be lies -- which partake of truth in their very essence -- which sear their way into one 's consciousness as white-hot iron scorches the flesh .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 51]: Still , owing to my trust in you , I clung to the frail hope that there might be some mistake , so , when they had gone , I telephoned the Central Hotel , and a clerk there assured me that Monsieur de Courtois was in bed and asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 7]: `` What am I to say ?
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 6]: Perhaps , silence is best .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 12]: Marcelle and I are returning to my apartments in 59th Street .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 6]: Please do not come there .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 11]: I feel now that I have been selfish and misguided .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 43]: I fear it will hurt you if I ask to be permitted to bear the heavy expense you must incur with regard to the wretched affair into which I have dragged you , though involuntarily , or , shall I put it ?
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 13]: with the blind striving for succor of one sinking in deep waters .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 14]: Yet , do me one last kindness , and let me reimburse you .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 32]: That would be a small concession to my pride , because , in some respects , sorely as I am wounded , I shall regard myself as ever in your debt .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 6]: `` Sincerely yours , HERMIONE .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 3]: `` P.S. .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 10]: This person , Schmidt , seems to be reliable .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 8]: You might arrange matters with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 13]: Now , above and beyond every other characteristic , Curtis was fair-minded .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 49]: He read the girl 's letter once in order to learn what had happened and why she had gone : then he reread it critically , word for word , trying to distil from its disjointed phrases `` that essence of truth '' which Hermione had spoken of .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 16]: Evidently , she had determined to keep her words within the bare walls of necessity .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 29]: The note had a jerkiness of style that was certainly absent from her speech , and the fact argued that she was compelling herself to write with restraint .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 81]: She was brimming over with reproach , grief-stricken , and miserable , and unquestionably shocked beyond measure , but she had forced the reflection : `` I have no real claim on this man , nor wrong to lay at his door , and , although he has deceived me , I am under heavy obligation to him , so I must neither condemn nor reproach , but say nothing that goes beyond a temperate explanation of my action . ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 23]: The signature itself was eloquent of the conflict which raged in her troubled brain while the pen was framing those formal sentences .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 29]: Well-bred young ladies do not sign themselves by their Christian names , _ tout court _ , in notes written to young gentlemen of an evening 's acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 8]: Yet , what was she to do ?
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 41]: `` Hermione Beauregard Grandison '' had gone beyond recovery with the marriage ceremony , but `` Hermione Curtis '' was almost ludicrous , considering the text of this , the first note she had written to her `` husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 24]: It was only one side of Curtis 's self-reliant nature which analyzed , and criticised , and weighed matters with such judicial calm .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 40]: There was another which brought a hard glint into his eyes , and caused a hand which gripped the molded back of a lightly-built chair to exert a force of which he was unconscious until the mahogany rail snapped .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 16]: Then he remembered Steingall , and his enigmatical inquiries , and turned to the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 22]: At sound of his voice , the detective cleared away any doubt as to the reason which inspired those vague questions .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 10]: `` Lady Hermione has gone , has she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 4]: he said sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 6]: `` I thought as much .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 47]: There was no use in worrying you about it sooner , but I was told that the Earl and Schmidt had visited her , and that she and the maid had left the hotel in a taxi a few minutes after the departure of the visitors .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 7]: Will you take my advice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 12]: `` You ought to have said ` Yes ' at once .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 10]: Go to bed , and force yourself to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 24]: Give no instructions to be called , but get up when you waken , and start a new day with a clear head .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 6]: You 'll need it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 26]: `` I 'm not going to disturb the peace of Lady Hermione 's apartments in 59th Street , if that is what you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 4]: `` Not quite .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 7]: In fact , not at all .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 9]: You are not that kind of a man .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 7]: Did she leave any message ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 6]: `` Yes , a letter .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 8]: Would you care to hear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 8]: `` If you have no objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 55]: Curtis read the note instantly , and , so delicate is the perceptiveness of the ear , he could almost follow the trend of the detective 's unspoken thought by a hiss of breath or a muttered `` Hum , '' as a name was mentioned or a reason given for some particular action .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 30]: `` Like the majority of women , she conveys the most important fact in a postscript , '' was Steingall 's dry comment when Curtis had reached the end .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 11]: `` Where shall I find this man , Schmidt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 3]: inquired Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 17]: `` Are you in a hurry , then , to begin the suit for dissolution ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 13]: `` That does not account for my anxiety to meet Schmidt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 24]: `` He is a stoutly-built individual , with a large , soft neck , and eyes which would protrude most satisfactorily under pressure .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 7]: Is that what you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 16]: `` I want to make his acquaintance , and soon -- that is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 18]: `` Now , Mr. Curtis , do n't destroy the good opinion I have formed of you .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 5]: Let well enough alone .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 27]: Schmidt has done you a splendid turn , and it would be foolish on your part to requite a benefactor by trying to strangle him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 35]: `` Mr. Steingall , I am tired , and very , very uncertain of myself -- '' `` So you do n't want even to pretend that there is any humor in the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 39]: Yet , unless I err greatly , before many hours have passed you will agree with me that nothing more directly fortunate in your behalf could have occurred than Schmidt 's interference as Lord Valletort 's legal adviser .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 9]: I know Schmidt , and Schmidt knows me .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 24]: In this affair you would be a baby in his hands , just as he would resemble a bladder of lard in yours .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 51]: My difficulty is that I really can not give reasons , but you will appreciate the position when I say that , for the moment , the murder of Mr. Hunter has become an affair of state , and all information regarding recent developments will be withheld from the press .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 5]: Do you follow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 50]: `` I take it , too , that if Lady Hermione were restored to you , and it was left to the pair of you to determine whether or not the marriage entered into under such extraordinary conditions should become a real union , you would be satisfied ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 81]: `` I do n't see how -- '' `` You can at least take my word for it , Mr. Curtis , that the chance of such an outcome will be greatly forwarded if you go straight to bed , whereas any design you may have formed as to assaulting and battering Otto Schmidt would , if put into execution , probably defeat the more important object , or , at any rate , cripple its prospects of success . ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 8]: `` Do you really mean that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 8]: `` I am almost sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 16]: There is only one thing of which I am more certain at the moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 6]: `` And that is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 36]: `` That if it were not for your quickness of eye and hand -- and foot , for that matter -- I would now be laid out in a mortuary or on an hospital table .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 59]: I appreciate those qualities when exercised on a person like Martiny , whose main argument is centered in an automatic pistol , but they would be singularly out of place if tested on Otto Schmidt , when backed by the laws of the United States , which , strange as it may seem , I also represent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 18]: `` If you put it that way , Steingall -- '' `` I do , most emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 6]: Let me be more precise .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 20]: Promise me now that you will not stir out of the Plaza Hotel until I come to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 7]: `` Is that really essential ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 12]: `` I would not ask you if it were not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 9]: `` What time may I expect you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 12]: `` Let me see ... It is now nearly five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 7]: I hope to sleep till eight .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 6]: I give you till nine .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 8]: Bath and breakfast brings you to ten .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 4]: Say eleven . ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 16]: `` I owe you a good deal , so I shall await you till noon .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 11]: After that hour I reserve my freedom of action . ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 4]: The detective laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 31]: `` Good-by , '' he said , and , as though in keeping with the other fantasies of the night , Curtis was sound asleep in quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 49]: He had acquired the faculty of sleeping under any conditions of mental or physical stress , short of illness or severe bodily pain , and he could awake at any hour previously determined on , so , a few minutes before nine o'clock he was in his bath .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 13]: At a quarter-past nine he rang for a waiter and ordered breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 7]: `` For one , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 32]: said the man , who had not been on duty the previous evening , but had taken care to ascertain the names of the guests on his section of the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 10]: `` Yes , for one , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 13]: `` My wife and her maid are not breakfasting in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 12]: Will you kindly send up a batch of morning newspapers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 33]: It was only to be expected that the keen and bright intelligence of New York journalism should have fastened on to the murder in 27th Street as something out of the ordinary .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 48]: But its methods were new to the man whose adult years had been passed far from his native city , and he was astounded now to find how the descriptive reporter , aided by the photographer , had depicted and dissected nearly every feature of the crime .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 11]: On one point the press was silent -- as yet .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 52]: There was no mention of Lady Hermione , and , with a reticence which spoke volumes for the close relations existing between police and reporters , the Earl of Valletort and Count Vassilan were represented as merely `` enquiring for '' John Delancy Curtis , `` the man from Pekin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 47]: Curtis had spread the newspapers on the table , and , when a tap on the door of the sitting-room seemed to indicate the re-appearance of the waiter , he swept them up in a heap , meaning to go through them at leisure after breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 11]: `` Come in , '' he said , turning casually .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 8]: The door opened , and Hermione entered .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 34]: It was what dramatists term `` a psychological moment , '' and , according to Berkeley , one of the axioms of psychology is that it never transcends the limits of the individual .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 27]: Most certainly , at that moment , the truth of this dictum was demonstrated in a manner which would have surprised even the doughty philosopher himself .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 26]: Curtis saw nothing , knew nothing , thought of nothing not strictly bounded by the fact that Hermione , and none other , stood there .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 11]: He gazed at her spell-bound for a second or two .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 30]: He neither moved nor spoke , but remained stock-still , with the newspapers gathered in his hands , while his eyes blazed into hers without any pretense of restraint .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 35]: She was rosy red , partly because of the wine-like morning air through which she had walked swiftly , but more , perhaps , because of a very real embarrassment and contriteness of spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 22]: `` I came , '' she faltered -- `` I am here -- that is -- will you ever forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 16]: -- '' Down went the papers , and round Hermione went Curtis 's strong arms .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 22]: He was a man of thew and sinew , against whom a slender girl 's strength might not hope to prevail .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 13]: The last thing she looked for was to be embraced at sight .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 22]: It is the last thing any woman expects , and the one thing to which she is most apt to yield .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 22]: And really , despite her fluttered cry of protest , there was something very comforting and dependable about that masculine hug .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 12]: Hermione had never before been clasped in a man 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 39]: She was a highly kissable person , and women would embrace her readily , but the total absence of any milk-and-water convention about Curtis 's method of showing delight at meeting her was at once bewildering and stupefying .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 74]: There must be a great deal , too , which does not leap promptly to the eye in the study of such a dry-as-dust subject as psychology , because three of its fixed principles are : `` Experience is the process of becoming expert by experiment , '' `` One finds a measure of truth in the naïve realism of Common Sense ; '' and `` Action and Reaction are strictly correlative . ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 116]: Applying these tests to the remarkable rapidity of decision and fixity of purpose displayed by Curtis in squeezing the breath out of Hermione , and gazing into her eyes until her proud head bent and sought refuge for a glowing face by hiding it on his breast , it will be noted first , that , for a man who had no experience in love-making , Curtis was quickly becoming expert ; secondly , that Common Sense teaches that if one would win a wife one must also woo her ; and thirdly , that a wonderfully effective way to obtain a satisfactory response from Hermione was to reveal the educational value of a hug .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 40]: At last , then -- though not before Hermione 's arms had gone around his neck of their own accord , and her lips had met his with a sigh of sheer content -- he permitted her to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 17]: And of all things in the world she said that which it thrilled him to hear .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 45]: `` John , dear , '' she murmured , `` we have become husband and wife in a strange , mad way , but , perhaps it is for the best , and I shall try never to give you cause for regret . ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 28]: By this time one hand was firmly braced around her waist , but the other was free to lift her chin until her swimming eyes met his .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 27]: `` Hermione , '' he said , `` I vowed last night that not all the men and laws in America would tear you from me .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 37]: If we parted , it was you , and you alone , who could send me away , and I am glad , oh , so glad , that you have come back to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 14]: `` Dearest , it sounds like a dream , '' she said brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 23]: `` Can a man and a woman truly love each other who have only met as you and I have met ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 46]: `` I think we have solved that problem for all time , '' he said , tilting her hat with the joyous abandon of a lover jealous even of the flowers and plaited straw which should hide any of the sweet perfections of his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 16]: `` But you have plunged me into a sort of trance , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 31]: `` I came here to explain -- '' An ominous rattle of a laden tray at the outer door drove them apart as though a thunderbolt had fallen between them .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 30]: Hermione rushed to her own room , there to consult a mirror , and readjust her hat and veil and disordered hair , but Curtis met a hurrying waiter .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 28]: `` Sorry to bother you , '' he said , `` but my wife has come in unexpectedly , and we shall want breakfast for two . ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 19]: He raised his voice : `` Coffee for you , Hermione , or would you prefer tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 32]: `` Coffee , of course , '' was the answer , in so calm and collected a tone that the waiter thought he must have been mistaken in his first impression .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 20]: `` No trouble at all , sir , '' he said , with the ready civility of his class .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 29]: `` Unless you wish to wait , sir , I 'll bring another cup and some hot plates , and order a further supply from the kitchen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 13]: `` You 're a man of resource , '' cried Curtis cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 15]: `` I leave the arrangements to you with confidence ... Come along , Hermione .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 9]: Do n't say you have breakfasted already . ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 32]: `` I wo n't , because I have n't , '' she said , reappearing with a smiling nonchalance which removed the last shred of doubt from the waiter 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 31]: But , for all that , she electrified Curtis with a timidly grateful glance , for she appreciated his thoughtfulness in giving her an opportunity to collect her scattered wits .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 30]: There was need of some such respite ; she had much to relate , she thought , before he could possibly understand the motives which led to her flight .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 16]: Barely half an hour ago Mr. Steingall had put in an appearance at her apartment .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 28]: He had told her , with convincing brevity , exactly why Curtis refrained from adding to her perplexities by announcing the comparative well-being of Jean de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 50]: `` He was very kind , '' said Hermione , sweetly penitent , `` but he made me feel rather like a worm when he said that if I were his own daughter he would thank God that I had fallen into the hands of a man like you .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 46]: He said , too , that if I owed you something , he owed you more , because you had saved his life last night , so , being an impulsive creature , I hurried here to ask your forgiveness for that horrid note . ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 18]: `` There is no lie so difficult to combat as a half truth , '' said John .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 17]: `` That fellow , Schmidt , impressed you because he probably believed what he was saying .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 36]: As for Steingall , he makes rather too much of what I did for him , but , if there was any debt on his side , he has repaid me with ample interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 25]: The waiter had left the room , and Hermione was free to blush without restraint , a privilege she availed herself of fully now .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 21]: `` But , dear , you and I can hardly feel that we are really married , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 8]: `` Yesterday -- it was -- different .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 7]: I can not remain here now .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 53]: Perhaps your uncle and aunt will receive me -- until -- '' `` It is surprising how easily one can get married if one is really bent on the act , '' said Curtis , discussing the point as coolly as if it were a question as to where they would lunch .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 15]: `` At any rate , we shall settle that difficulty to your complete satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 10]: I expect Steingall here in less than an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 10]: Meanwhile , we have lots to tell each other .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 18]: I want you to know just what sort of husband you have drawn in the lottery . ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 11]: `` Do you take me on trust , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 6]: `` Absolutely without reservation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 13]: Obviously , the conversation did not flag before the detective was announced .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 36]: He looked tired and preoccupied when he came in , but his shrewd , pleasant face brightened with a cheery smile when he saw Hermione , who was pretending to be interested in a newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 22]: `` I am glad to find that two people , at least , have taken my advice , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 13]: `` Now , Mr. Curtis , I want you for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 17]: The various official inquiries are adjourned till next week , and your presence was dispensed with .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 64]: But we are going now to the office of Mr. Otto Schmidt , where we shall have the pleasure of meeting the Earl of Valletort , Count Ladislas Vassilan , and , possibly , Monsieur Jean de Courtois ... On no account , young lady , '' and he turned to Hermione , `` must you run away again during our absence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 16]: `` I shall not , '' said Hermione , so emphatically that they all laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 10]: CHAPTER XVI A PARLEY Nature was kind that morning .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 50]: A flood of sunshine greeted Curtis when he turned into Fifth Avenue with the detective , as the latter had suggested that they might walk a little way before taking a taxi , there being plenty of time before the hour fixed for the meeting in Schmidt 's office .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 30]: It was a morning when life and good health assumed their fitting places in the forefront of those many and varied considerations which form the sum of human happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 13]: The world had suddenly resumed its everyday aspect of bustle and content .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 18]: New York smiled at its new citizen , and the new citizen beamed appreciatively on New York .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 39]: `` I can not explain matters to you fully even yet -- '' Steingall was saying , when an automobile drew up close to the curb , and a well-known voice cried joyously : `` Just in time .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 5]: Where 's the fire ?
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 16]: There 's bound to be a blaze when you two run in a leash . ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 13]: Devar bounced out of the car , and Brodie grinned with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 20]: The chauffeur was beginning to like the excitement of acting as supernumerary on the staff of the Detective Bureau .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 17]: `` Will you jump in , or shall I prowl with you down Fifth Avenue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 11]: asked Devar , blithely ignoring Steingall 's somewhat strained welcome .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 11]: `` We are keeping an appointment , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 27]: `` I , for one , shall be more than pleased if the combination which proved so effective last night may remain intact this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 13]: `` Steingall dare n't cut adrift from me , '' said Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 29]: `` If you knew the truth about him , you 'd find that he is deeply superstitious , and I 'm a real mascot for bringing good luck .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 24]: Perhaps he is not aware , John D. , that I was the impresario who ` presented ' you to an admiring public .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 19]: Tell him that , and see if he has the nerve to say I 'm not wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 19]: `` Come along , Mr. Devar , '' said the detective , apparently yielding to a sudden resolve .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 17]: `` I think I can make use of you -- justify your presence , that is .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 12]: Tell your chauffeur to wait for us at 42d Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 16]: Off went Brodie , jubilant at the prospect of his services being in requisition again .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 23]: He had not yet learnt the application to all things mundane of Disraeli 's quip that it is the unexpected which happens .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 45]: `` Now , I want you two gentlemen to attend closely to what I have to say , '' said Steingall seriously , placing himself between them , so that his words might not reach other ears than those for which they were intended .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 17]: `` Mr. Hunter 's murder has passed long ago out of the common class of crimes .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 24]: It will be inquired into thoroughly , of course , and punishment will be dealt out impartially to those responsible for its commission .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 38]: But -- and this is the point I want to emphasize -- neither of you know , nor am I at liberty to inform you -- just what bounds the authorities may reach , or stop at .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 8]: Have I made my meaning clear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 28]: `` We 're to be good little boys , and sit still , and say nothing , and do as we 're told , '' said Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 26]: `` I 'm not asking impossibilities , '' said Steingall , who had a dry humor , and seldom missed a chance of gratifying it .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 32]: `` I have merely laid down a proviso which must be observed , not for a day , or a week , but as long as any of us is alive .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 9]: State affairs are not the property of individuals .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 8]: They come first , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 19]: If they do n't suit our convenience , we must simply adjust ourselves to the new conditions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 11]: `` You alarm me , Steingall , '' cried Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 10]: `` Have we been drawn into an international squabble ?
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 18]: Do n't tell me that Devar 's canned salmon is really a deadly sort of bomb . ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 8]: `` I 've heard more improbable things .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 33]: But you would not be your father 's son , Mr. Devar , if you ca n't keep a tight lip when statements are made in your presence which may astonish you .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 31]: Mr. Curtis and you are now about to meet a very clever man , Otto Schmidt , the lawyer , and I fancy your name will help in the argument .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 8]: Is your father in New York ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 9]: `` He arrives here from Chicago to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 9]: `` He has never met Mr. Curtis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 10]: `` No , but he jolly soon will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 29]: `` But , if it were possible to get hold of him by telephone or telegraph to-day , he would say he had never heard of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 7]: `` I guess that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 7]: What are you driving at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 7]: `` Schmidt must know your father .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 15]: They are bound to have come together in more than one important deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 26]: `` It seems to me that , if the father 's evidence is not available , the son 's gains a trifle more weight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 17]: `` Dash me if I can imagine where you are getting off at , Steingall . ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 10]: `` You regard Mr. Curtis as a friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 9]: `` I am proud of the fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 14]: `` Stick to that , and you will do him good service . ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 8]: `` Well , that 's easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 15]: The detective seemed to be picking his words with a good deal of care .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 28]: He covered several paces in silence , and Curtis , who had reverted to his normal habit of sober gravity , took no part in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 10]: His estimate of its purport differed from Devar 's .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 62]: That light-hearted youngster was somewhat annoyed by the detective 's implied hint that his friendship with Curtis rested on no more solid foundation than a steamer acquaintance , and would hardly bear the test of close scrutiny if it came to analysis on the score of prior knowledge , or if his testimony were sought as to Curtis 's earlier career .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 23]: But he had the good sense to understand that Steingall was actuated by no light motive , so he held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 4]: Curtis went farther .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 17]: He believed that the detective was telling Devar what to say and how to say it .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 36]: `` Now that we have settled the matter of Mr. Curtis 's references , '' said Steingall , resuming the talk as though it had not been interrupted , `` I reach the next item .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 31]: Both of you are aware that two men have been arrested , and one is dead , and that all three were concerned in the attack on Mr. Hunter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' came the simultaneous answer .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 17]: `` I want you to forget names , except with regard to Lamotte , the chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 15]: Martiny and Rossi , for the time being , vanish into the Ewigkeit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 6]: `` What -- forever ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 6]: Curtis could not help saying .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 10]: `` No , for a week or so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 9]: Steingall darted a quick glance to his questioner .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 18]: `` I have a stupid trick of adopting phrases from my pet authors , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 7]: `` Does Ewigkeit mean eternity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 10]: `` Well , then , I withdraw it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 5]: `` Try Niflheim . ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 9]: `` Or Rüdesheim , '' suggested Devar wickedly .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 3]: Steingall laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 16]: Despite his German-sounding name , he spoke French fluently , but German not at all .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 11]: `` They 're off the map , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 26]: `` There , that 's good American , and I 'll get on with my story , or rather , with the lack of it .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 56]: I can not , of course , foretell the exact lines our discussion with Schmidt and his clients will follow , but if I have made you understand that your combined share in it is to say little , and be thoroughly non-committal in anything you may have to say , I am content . ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 13]: `` You are as mysterious as an astrologer , '' vowed Devar .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 56]: `` Having money to burn one day in Paris , I visited one of those jokers , and he told me I was born in Capricorn , under the sign of Aries , and I as good as told him he was a liar , because I was born in Manhattan under an ordinary roof .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 3]: By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 14]: that reminds me , John D. , you 're a whale on stars .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 15]: Did you spot those two last night , low down in the west ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 8]: `` And what did they prognosticate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 27]: `` That you and I would promise Mr. Steingall not to spoil any scheme he may have in mind by interfering at an inopportune moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 18]: `` I suppose I ought to feel crushed , but I do n't , '' said Devar .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 41]: `` My dear fellow , if it had n't been for you and your loyal championship at the right moment , I might easily have been in jail as an accomplice of the unknown scoundrels who killed Mr. Hunter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 15]: `` That 's the right kind of remark , '' broke in the detective .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 21]: `` I think I 'll offer each of you a post in the Bureau after this business is ended . ''
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 13]: `` Give me a pointer on one matter , '' said Devar .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 8]: `` You spoke of Schmidt 's clients .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 5]: Who are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 16]: He whistled softly when he heard the names of Valletort and Vassilan and de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 10]: `` Up to the neck in it again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 3]: he crowed .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 25]: `` Oh , it 's me that is the happy youth because I blew in to New York at the right time yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 18]: Otto Schmidt 's office was in Madison Square , perched high above the clatter of 23d Street .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 57]: The windows of the lawyer 's private sanctum commanded magnificent views of the city to south and west , and in that marvelously clear air the Statue of Liberty seemed to be little more than a mile away , while the villas of Montclair and houses on other heights in the neighboring State were distinctly visible .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 28]: Steingall and his friends were the first to arrive , and Schmidt received them with the air of armed neutrality a lawyer displays towards the opposite camp .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 36]: He begged them to be seated , smiled pleasantly when Curtis asked to be allowed to admire the interesting panorama spread before his eyes , but gave Devar a contemplative look when Steingall introduced him .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 14]: `` Mr. Howard Devar , son of my friend William B. Devar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said Devar , feeling that this was safe ground .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 28]: `` My father and you put it that way since you pulled off the Saskatchewan Combine together , but I 've heard him describe you differently . ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 20]: Schmidt , who looked more egg-like than ever at this hour of the morning , disapproved of such flippancy .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 13]: `` William B. Devar is a fair fighter , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 12]: `` He gives and takes hard knocks with perfect good humor .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 38]: But , may I inquire how you come to figure in a matter which , if I understand aright a message received from Mr. Steingall , concerns persons with whom you can have little in common ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 56]: `` It was a mere toss-up whether I or my friend , John Delancy Curtis , took the floor against the combination of noble lords who have retained you to look after their interests , or protect them , I ought to say ; but fate favored him , so I am a mere bottle-holder .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 22]: To push the simile a bit farther , Mr. Schmidt , I may describe Mr. Steingall as the referee and watch-holder .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 13]: When he cries ` Time ' someone will go to Sing-Sing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 41]: Perhaps some attribute of the father revealed itself in the son , because Steingall , who thought at first that Devar had allowed his tongue to run away with him , fancied that the lawyer dropped his inquiries somewhat suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 21]: `` The Earl of Valletort and Count Vassilan are due now , '' he said , glancing at a clock .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 15]: `` Oh , they will be here without fail , '' said the detective .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 14]: `` Mr. Clancy , of the Bureau , is bringing de Courtois . ''
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 5]: `` Bringing him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 3]: repeated Schmidt .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 4]: `` Unofficially ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 8]: `` That depends wholly on de Courtois .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 12]: He has to come , whether he likes it or not .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 14]: Whether he will be allowed to go away again is another matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 7]: Schmidt 's eyelids fell in thought .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 19]: Probably he reflected that there are two sides to every argument , and he had heard but one .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 27]: Certainly , John Delancy Curtis did not strike him as the dare-devil meddler , if not worse , he had been depicted by the fiery Earl .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 25]: `` The Earl of Valletort and Count Ladislas Vassilan , '' announced a clerk , and Curtis took one square look at his rival .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 11]: He needed no more to confirm Hermione 's unfavorable opinion .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 8]: The Count 's appearance was not prepossessing .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 25]: His nose was still swollen , and the earnest effort of a doctor to paint out two black eyes had not been wholly successful .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 42]: His lordship looked mightily displeased when he discovered the presence of Curtis and Devar , but he was a self-confident man , and regarded himself as a personage of such importance that he assumed the lead in this company at once .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 18]: Moreover , it was evident that he had resolved to keep a firm rein on his temper .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 19]: `` Now , Mr. Schmidt , '' he said brusquely , `` your time and mine is valuable .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 17]: Why have Count Vassilan and I been summoned here this morning by the police authorities ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 18]: Schmidt looked at Steingall , and the detective seemed to be almost at a loss for words .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 20]: `` I am -- not aware -- there is any particular call -- for hurry , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 18]: `` Are you , my lord , and Count Vassilan thinking of returning to Europe to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 30]: The Hungarian laughed , not mirthfully , but with the forced gayety of a man who had considered how to act , and meant to adopt a decided attitude .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 14]: `` Certainly not , '' said the Earl stiffly , with uplifted eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 14]: Steingall pursed his lips , and his forehead seamed in a reflective frown .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 36]: `` I ought to explain , '' he said , `` that I put that question as offering what appeared to me an easy way out of a situation which bristles with difficulties otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 32]: His hesitancy had suddenly been replaced by slowness of utterance , but it is reasonable to suppose that , of those present , Curtis and Schmidt alone noted the marked distinction .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 29]: `` My good man , '' said the Earl , `` you must have the strangest notion of the reason which accounts for my presence in New York .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 30]: I came here to rescue my daughter from a set of designing ruffians , some of whom I knew of , and others whom I had never heard of .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 44]: Why you should think that I may have it in mind to leave the country without being accompanied by Lady Hermione Grandison I can not tell , and it is in the highest degree improbable that she will be prepared to sail to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 26]: Apart from my private arrangements , too , I mean to remain here until I have punished at least one person as he deserves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 6]: `` Jean de Courtois ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 3]: inquired Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 15]: That man who stands there , and whose name is given as Curtis . ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 6]: The Earl nearly grew wrathful .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 22]: It annoyed him to find that Curtis was not looking at him at all , but was greatly interested in Schmidt .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 8]: That was another trait of Curtis 's .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 20]: He had learnt long ago to select the ablest among his adversaries , and watch that man 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 31]: Mere impassivity supplied no real cloak , for Curtis , in his time , had dealt with Chinese mandarins whose countenances betrayed no more expression than a carved ivory mask .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 14]: `` But it was de Courtois who meant to marry Lady Hermione ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 3]: persisted Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 7]: `` That remains to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 13]: The person who did marry her signed himself John Delancy Curtis . ''
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 8]: Instantly the detective turned to Otto Schmidt .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 50]: `` It will assist the inquiry if you tell us whether or not such a marriage , if it took place under the assumed conditions , that is , by use of a marriage license not intended for one of the parties , is legal , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 26]: `` I have no doubt whatever that , in the circumstances , the courts will find it to be illegal , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 5]: `` What circumstances ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 23]: `` That the lady quitted her supposed husband as soon as she discovered the fraud which had been practised on her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 8]: Steingall weighed the point for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 8]: `` I see , '' he nodded .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 16]: `` If she refused to remain with him , the marriage would be declared void .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 39]: But if she elected to treat the marriage as a binding act , no matter how it was procured , and continued to live with her husband , that vital fact would affect the question of validity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 13]: `` As you say , it would be a vital fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 16]: The detective was clearly impressed , but Lord Valletort swept aside these quibbles of jurisprudence .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 19]: `` My daughter 's actions will be revealed in detail to a judge , '' he said loftily .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 36]: `` At present I fail to see what bearing they have on the discussion , unless , indeed , you mean to arrest Curtis immediately on a charge which I am prepared to formulate . ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 30]: `` No , that is not why I requested your lordship and Count Vassilan to come here this morning , '' said Steingall , gazing anxiously at the clock .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 58]: `` I would prefer to await the arrival of Detective Clancy with Jean de Courtois , but , if the Frenchman refuses to come , he is within his rights , and I suppose I shall have to apply for a warrant , though , if I choose , I can arrest him merely on suspicion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 6]: `` Suspicion of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 4]: demanded the Earl .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 13]: `` Of complicity in the murder of Mr. Hunter last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 34]: `` The man was tied in his room at the time of the murder , '' cried the Hungarian hoarsely , speaking for the first time since he had entered Schmidt 's office .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 27]: He was obviously excited , and excitement is a powerful foe of good resolutions , with which the moral pavement is littered in Hungary and elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 15]: `` That does not affect the charge of complicity , '' said Steingall thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 25]: `` A man may be an accomplice , though the actual crime is committed at a time and place when he is far distant .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 31]: It is possible for an accomplice to be in Paris , or on the high seas , while a victim is falling under an assassin 's knife in New York .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 44]: A man , or a number of men , can even be what I may term unconscious accomplices , in the sense that their actions and instructions have brought about a crime , though their intent may have stopped short of actual violence .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 39]: I assure you , my lord , the arm of the law reaches far when life is taken , and the death of a popular and prominent journalist like Mr. Hunter will be inquired into most searchingly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 34]: The detective spoke so impressively that Lord Valletort eyed him with a species of misgiving , while Count Vassilan , whose knowledge of English was excellent , had broken out into a perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 8]: A smooth , mellifluous voice suddenly intervened .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 17]: Otto Schmidt thought fit to assume a role for which Lord Valletort was manifestly ill equipped .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 25]: `` We seem to be dealing with two items which , though related , by accident , as it were , yet differ widely .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 17]: The Earl of Valletort is interested only in his daughter 's marriage , Mr. Steingall . ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 7]: The detective wheeled round on him .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 32]: `` Precisely , Mr. Schmidt , but it happens , unfortunately , that the marriage of Lady Hermione and Mr. Curtis was the direct outcome of the murder of Mr. Hunter .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 25]: More than that , Mr. Hunter met his death because of the plot and counter-plot attending the preliminary arrangements for her ladyship 's marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 17]: The two events , so far apart in their nature , thus become indissolubly connected . ''
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 18]: `` And is that why we are to have the pleasure of seeing Monsieur de Courtois ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 35]: `` Perhaps , before he comes , you will be good enough to give us some idea , informally of course , as to the statement , -- or , shall I say revelation ?
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 6]: -- he may make . ''
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 44]: `` It is asking a good deal of a police official , '' said Steingall , smiling pleasantly , `` but if I am assured that the discussion will really be regarded as informal , I am ready to speak quite openly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 27]: `` It is a characteristic of yours , Mr. Steingall , which has often commanded the admiration of the New York bar , '' said Schmidt .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 36]: `` Then , '' said the detective , `` I must begin by telling you that Mr. Clancy and I were in Morris Siegelman 's saloon in East Broadway shortly after midnight last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 30]: A curious click issued from the throat of that distinguished Hungarian magnate , Count Ladislas Vassilan , and everyone present noticed it except the chief of the Detective Bureau .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 12]: He , it would appear , was busy marshaling his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 15]: `` For all practical purposes , our inquiry began there , '' he continued .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 23]: `` We intercepted a note written by a certain gentleman , and intended to be conveyed to a Pole named Peter Balusky .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 36]: He , and a Hungarian , Franz Viviadi , together with a French chauffeur , whose real name is Lamotte , but who has been passing recently as Anatole Labergerie , are now under arrest .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 33]: Mr. Curtis has recognized Lamotte as the driver of the automobile out of which Mr. Hunter stepped to meet his death , and Lamotte himself has confessed his share in the crime .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 15]: The precise connection of Balusky and Viviadi with it remains yet to be determined .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 9]: They undoubtedly visited the Central Hotel last night .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 21]: They undoubtedly were the paid agents of some person or persons interested in preventing the marriage of Lady Hermione Grandison .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 38]: They undoubtedly received letters and wireless messages which seem to implicate others , far removed from them in social position , in the plot , or undertaking , that her ladyship 's marriage should not take place .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 64]: As a lawyer , Mr. Schmidt , you will see that I can not possibly enter into full details , but I think I have said sufficient to prove my main contention , which is , you will remember , that it will be difficult , very difficult , to dissociate the two incidents -- I mean the marriage and the murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 23]: During quite an appreciable time there was no sound in the spacious apartment other than the heavy breathing of Count Ladislas Vassilan .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 9]: He had openly and candidly abandoned all pretense .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 19]: He was now nothing more nor less than a burly , well-fed , well-dressed evil-doer quaking with fear .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 10]: `` Difficult , you say , Mr. Steingall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 22]: repeated the lawyer , selecting , as was his way , the word which supplied the key to a whole sentence .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 9]: `` Very difficult , '' corrected the detective .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 6]: `` But not impossible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 60]: `` I would not care to hazard a reasoned opinion , but it seems to me that , in certain conditions , the District Attorney might elect to confine the inquiry to its main issues , which are , of course , the causes of the crime , and the conviction of the persons actually engaged in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 13]: `` Why did you want to bring Jean de Courtois here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 18]: `` Because he is the connecting link between the one set of circumstances and the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 10]: `` Is he coming , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 18]: Steingall looked at the clock , and showed a disappointment which he did not try to conceal .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 9]: `` I fear not , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 13]: `` I told Clancy only to try and persuade him to come .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 18]: The Frenchman is pretending to be ill , but he is not ill , only frightened . ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 6]: `` Frightened of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 9]: `` Of the consequences of his own acts .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 33]: In a sense , Mr. Hunter was his ally , but only from a journalist 's standpoint , which centered in the sensation which would be provided by the projected marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 14]: Schmidt 's eyelids had fallen and risen regularly during the past few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 10]: They dropped now for a longer period than usual .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 18]: As for Lord Valletort and his would-be son-in-law , they were profoundly and unfeignedly ill at ease .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 48]: Even a British Earl can not afford to play fast and loose with the law , and it did seem most convincingly clear that they had brought themselves within measurable reach of the law by the tactics they had employed prior to their arrival in New York .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 38]: Oddly enough , their own possible connection with the murder of the journalist was a good deal more patent to them than to Curtis and Devar , who were vastly better posted in the evidence affecting them .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 15]: Still more curiously , not a word had been said about Martiny or Rossi .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 52]: `` Let us suppose , '' said Schmidt , when his eyes had opened again , `` that Lady Hermione elects to return to Europe at once with her father , the Earl -- '' Steingall shook his head with a weary smile , and the lawyer 's voice ceased suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 14]: `` Out of the question , Mr. Schmidt , out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 6]: I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 28]: Why , little more than half an hour ago I found her with Mr. Curtis in their apartments at the Plaza Hotel -- '' `` Ridiculous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 8]: shrieked Lord Valletort in a shrill falsetto .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 13]: `` My daughter passed the night in her apartment in 59th Street .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 8]: I myself saw her go there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 3]: `` Probably .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 16]: Your lordship would know the facts if you watched her departure from the Plaza Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 21]: But a woman has the inalienable privilege of changing her mind , and Lady Hermione has returned to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 85]: In fact , I am given to understand that she and Mr. Curtis are arranging a new marriage , not because the earlier ceremony is illegal , or can be upset , but in deference to certain natural scruples which such a charming young lady would be bound to entertain ... There can be no manner of doubt as to the correctness of what I am saying , '' and the detective 's tone grew emphatic in view of the Earl 's pish-tush gestures .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 10]: `` You have a telephone there , Mr. Schmidt .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 13]: Ring up the Plaza , and speak to the lady yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 8]: The lawyer did nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 29]: He eyed Curtis in his contemplative way , being aware that the quiet man standing near a window had favored him with his exclusive attention during the proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 10]: But Lord Valletort was moved now to stormy protest .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 25]: He was convulsed with passion , and seemed to be careless what the outcome might be so long as he lashed Curtis with venom .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 21]: `` You are the only person in this infernal city whose actions are consistent , '' he roared at him .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 38]: `` It is quite evident that you have ascertained by some means that my daughter is exceedingly wealthy , and you have managed to delude her into the belief that your conduct is altruistic and above reproach .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 20]: But you make a great mistake if you believe that I can be set aside as an incompetent fool .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 24]: I shall go straight from this office to that of the District Attorney , and lay the whole of the facts before him .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 15]: I -- '' `` Does your lordship wish to dispense with my services ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 10]: broke in Schmidt , speaking without flurry or heat .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 55]: The angry Earl choked , but remained silent , and the lawyer kept on in the same even tone : `` May I suggest , Mr. Steingall , that you and Mr. Curtis and Mr. Devar should step into another room while I have a brief consultation with Lord Valletort and Count Vassilan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 26]: `` I can not become a party to any arrangement -- '' began Steingall , but Otto Schmidt bowed him and his companions out suavely .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 17]: Those two understood each other fully , no matter what divergencies of opinion might exist elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 30]: When the door had closed on the three men in a smaller room , Devar was about to say something , but Steingall checked him with a warning hand .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 25]: Walking to a window , he stood there , with his back turned on his companions , and stared out into the square beneath .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 23]: Once they fancied they saw him nod his head in a species of signal , but they might have been in error .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 17]: At any rate , their thoughts were soon distracted by the entrance of the stout lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 44]: `` On some occasions , the fewest words are the most satisfactory , '' he said , `` so I wish to inform you , Mr. Steingall , that Lord Valletort and Count Vassilan intend to sail for Europe by to-morrow 's steamer .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 35]: They have empowered me to offer to pay the passage money to France of the music-teacher , Jean de Courtois , though not by the same vessel as that in which they purpose traveling .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 29]: As for you , Mr. Curtis , the Earl withdraws all threats , and leaves you to settle your dispute with the authorities as you may think fit .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 19]: May I add that if you choose to consult me I shall be glad to act for you .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 30]: I would not say this if it was merely a professional matter , but there are circumstances -- Certainly , I shall be here at eleven o'clock on Monday .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 10]: Till then , sir , I wish you good-day .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 5]: Good-day , Mr. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 6]: Remember me to your father .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 7]: By , by , Mr. Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 9]: You and I will meet at Philippi . ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 14]: Once the three were in Madison Square , Devar could not be restrained .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 35]: `` Steingall , '' he said , `` if you do n't tell me how you managed it , I 'll sit down right here on the sidewalk and blubber like a child . ''
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 5]: `` You were present .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 11]: You heard every word , '' said the detective blandly .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 10]: `` Yes , I know you scared them stiff .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 15]: But who , in Heaven 's name , are Peter Balusky and Franz Viviadi ?
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 7]: Where , did you find 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 23]: Did they drop from the skies , or come up from -- Well , where _ did _ you get 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 18]: `` Clancy and I bagged them quite easily after Mr. Curtis and you left Siegelman 's café .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 11]: All we had to do was wait till Vassilan quit .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 24]: They were hanging about all the time , but afraid to meet him ... Now , you must ask me no more questions .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 6]: I am going to Clancy .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 11]: He is keeping an eye on Jean de Courtois . ''
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 16]: `` Did you ever intend to have the Frenchman brought to Schmidt 's office ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 6]: `` Of course I did .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 4]: What a question !
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 2]: Good-by .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 5]: There 's your car .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 15]: I 'm off , '' and the detective swung himself into a passing streetcar .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 29]: `` Do you know , '' said Devar thoughtfully , `` I am beginning to believe that Steingall says a lot of things he really does n't mean .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 31]: I have n't quite made up my mind yet as to whether or not he has n't run an awful bluff on the noble lord and the most noble count .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 12]: And the weird thing is that Schmidt did n't call it .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 31]: Did it strike you , Curtis , that -- '' Then he looked at his friend , whose silent indifference to what he was saying could no longer pass unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 9]: `` What is it , old man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 7]: he asked , with ready solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 11]: `` Are you feeling the strain , or what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 9]: `` It is nothing , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 12]: `` A run in the car will soon clear my head .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 18]: Perhaps you and I might arrange for a long week-end , far away from New York . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 28]: A second time did Devar look at his friend , but , being really a good-natured and sympathetic person , he repressed the imminent cry of amazement .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 14]: Somehow , he realized the one spear-thrust which had pierced Curtis 's armor .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 18]: It was hateful that such a man should be told he had married Hermione for her money .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 18]: It was hateful to think that this might be said of him in the years to come .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 47]: It was even possible that she herself might come to believe it of him , and John Delancy Curtis 's knight-errant soul shrank and cringed under the thought , even while the memory of Hermione 's first kiss of love was still hot on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 20]: CHAPTER XVII WHEREIN JOHN AND HERMIONE BECOME ORDINARY MEMBERS OF SOCIETY But the phase passed like a disturbing dream .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 27]: Hermione herself laughed the notion to scorn : and a ready opportunity for such effective exorcism of an evil spirit was supplied by Devar 's tact .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 24]: When the two young men reached the hotel Devar insisted that Curtis should take Hermione for an hour 's run in the park .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 20]: `` Here 's the car , and it 's a fine morning , and you 've got the girl .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 7]: What more do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 19]: `` If Uncle Horace and Aunt Louisa show up before your return I 'll take care of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 20]: Now , who helps her ladyship to put on her hat and fur coat -- you or I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 17]: That duty , however , was discharged by a smiling and voluble maid named Marcelle Leroux .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 73]: So it befell that when Brodie piloted his charges into Central Park through Scholar 's Gate , Curtis behaved like a man deeply in love but gravely ill at ease , and Hermione , also in love , but afire with the divine flame of womanly faith , and therefore serenely blind to any possible obstacle which should thrust itself between her and the beloved , saw instantly that something was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 33]: Curtis was just the type of man who would torture himself unnecessarily about a consideration which certainly would not have rendered his inamorata less desirable in the eyes of the average wooer .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 58]: He knew that he had waited all his life to meet Hermione -- to meet her , and none other -- and the thought that , having found her , having snatched her , as it were , from the sacrificial altar of a false god , he should now lose her , was inflicting exquisite agony .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 24]: Happily , this girl-wife of his was adorably feminine , and she decided without inquiry that she was the cause of his melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 11]: `` Tell me , John , '' she said suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 5]: `` I am brave .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 6]: I can bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 10]: The unexpected words stirred him from his disconsolate mood .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 8]: `` Bear what , dear one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 28]: he asked , looking at her with the wistful eyes of Tantalus gazing at the luscious fruits which the wrathful winds wafted ever from his parched lips .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 28]: `` You know that you have made a mistake , and have brought me out here to -- to -- '' `` Ah , dear Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 23]: he sighed ; `` if I had but the strength of will to adopt that subterfuge it might prove easier for you .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 10]: But one thing I can not do , Hermione .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 12]: I refuse to set you free by means of a lie .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 15]: I love you , and will love you till life itself has sped . ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 9]: The trouble was not so bad , then .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 4]: She nestled closer .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 9]: `` What is it , John dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 20]: she cooed , quite confident of her ability to slay dragons so long as he talked in that strain .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 15]: He trembled a little , so overpowering was the bitter-sweet sense of her nearness .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 49]: `` It is rather horrible that you and I should have to discuss dollars and cents , '' he said , speaking with the slow distinctness of a man pronouncing his own death-sentence , `` but your father taunted me with the fact that you are very wealthy .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 5]: Is that true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 7]: `` Of course it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 8]: She affected to treat the matter seriously .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 18]: It was rather delicious to find her lover distressing himself about money , if that was all .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 7]: `` What is your income ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 4]: he demanded curtly .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 6]: `` I am quite rich .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 12]: I am worth about half a million dollars a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 9]: He groaned , and shrank away from her .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 11]: `` Why did you not tell me that sooner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 8]: he said , almost with a scowl .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 5]: `` Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 4]: Does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 12]: Is n't it rather nice to have plenty of money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 4]: `` Good God !
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 17]: It is hard to -- to -- '' His hands covered his face in sheer agony .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 8]: `` John , do n't be stupid .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 7]: Why alarm me in that way ?
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 10]: Wealth does n't bring happiness -- far from it .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 52]: But did n't you and I -- discover each other -- before -- before -- '' `` But I know , now , '' he said brokenly , `` and it is a mad absurdity to think that a woman of your place in the world should marry a poor engineer .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 16]: Do you realize that you receive every fortnight more than I earn in twelve months ?
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 22]: King Cophetua marrying a beggar-maid sounds excellent in romance , but who ever heard of a queen wedding a pauper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 11]: `` You are describing yourself rather lamely , John . ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 10]: `` Hermione , do n't drive me beyond endurance .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 11]: I ca n't bear it , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 13]: She caught his right hand , and imprisoned it lovingly in hers .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 14]: Her left hand went around his neck , and she drew him closer .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 29]: `` John , '' she whispered , and the fragrance of her was intoxicating , `` you must not break my poor heart after taking it by storm .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 21]: I want you , and shall keep you if I were ten times as rich and you were in rags .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 11]: What joy has money brought hitherto in my short life ?
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 13]: It killed my mother , and has alienated me from my father .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 15]: It has driven me to the verge of a folly I now shudder at .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 14]: It has caused death and suffering to men whom I have never seen .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 19]: It has separated a man and a woman who love each other even as you and I love .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 42]: If I were a poor girl , working for a living in office or shop , I should know what laughter meant , and cheerfulness , and the bright careless hours when the heart is light and the world goes well .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 19]: You have brought these things to me , dear , and you must not take them away now .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 4]: I forbid it .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 31]: I deny you that wrongful act with my very soul ... John , do you wish to see me in tears on this -- our first day -- together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 32]: Brodie summed up the remainder of the situation with unconscious accuracy in a subsequent disquisition delivered to an admiring circle in the servants ' hall at Mrs. Morgan Apjohn 's house .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 32]: `` Spooning is a right and proper thing in the right and proper place , '' he said , `` but Central Park on a fine morning is not the locality .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 53]: I was jogging along comfortably when I saw some guys in Columbus Plaza rubbering around at the car , and grinning like clowns at a circus , so I just opened up the engine a bit , and let her rip , except when a mounted cop cocked his eye at me .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 15]: But , bless you , them two inside did n't care if it snowed .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 37]: When I brought 'em back to the hotel , Mr. Curtis sez to me : ` We 've enjoyed that ride thoroughly , Brodie , but I had a notion that Central Park was larger . '
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 30]: Dash me , I took 'em over nine miles of roadway , and they thought I had gone in at 59th Street and come out at Eighth Avenue . ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 23]: Devar , too , appreciated the success of his maneuver when he saw Hermione 's sparkling eyes and Curtis 's complacent air .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 11]: `` Have you got a sister , Lady Hermione ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 17]: he asked _ à propos _ to nothing which she or any other person had said .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 14]: `` No , '' she answered , without the semblance of a blush .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 10]: `` I was only wondering , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 12]: `` If you had , you might have cabled for her .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 15]: I 'd just love to take her round the Park in that car . ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 22]: But the rest of that day , not to mention many successive days , was devoted to other matters than love-making .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 53]: Shoals of interviewers descended on Curtis and Hermione , on Devar , on Uncle Horace and Aunt Louisa , on Brodie , even on Mrs. Morgan Apjohn when it was discovered that she came to lunch , and on `` Vancouver '' Devar when he arrived at the Central Station that evening .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 8]: Steingall 's orders were imperative , however .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 58]: Not a syllable was to be uttered about the one topic concerning which the press was hungering for information , because the shooting affray in Market Street had now become known , and the gray car had been dragged out of the Hudson , and the reporters were agog for the news which was withheld at headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 17]: It was then that the magic word , _ sub judice _ , proved very useful .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 40]: Even in outspoken America , witnesses do not retail their evidence to all and sundry when men 's lives are at stake , and it was quickly determined to charge all five prisoners under one and the same indictment .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 23]: Yet , for reasons never understood by the public , Balusky and Viviadi were discharged , and Jean de Courtois was deported .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 16]: Martiny was sentenced to capital punishment , and Lamotte received a long term of imprisonment .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 50]: But these eventualities came long after Curtis and Hermione had been remarried in strict privacy , and in the presence of a small but select circle of friends , an occasion which supplied Aunt Louisa with fresh oceans of talk for the delectation of society in Bloomington , Indiana .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 10]: At the wedding breakfast , Steingall made a speech .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 62]: `` Once , '' he said , `` when the present happy event did not seem to be quite so easy of attainment as it looks to all of us now , my friend Mr. Curtis , playing upon a weakness of mine in the matter of literary allusions , suggested that I should substitute Niflheim for Ewigkeit as a simile .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 39]: I did n't know what Niflheim meant , but I have ascertained since that it is a Scandinavian word describing a region of cold and darkness , a place , therefore , where people might easily get lost .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 32]: Well , it might have suited certain conditions I had then in my mind , but Mr. Curtis will never go to Scandinavian mythology when he wants to describe New York .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 17]: To my thinking , it will figure in his mind as more akin to Elysium . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 48]: Clancy led the applause with sardonic appreciation , whereupon his chief allowed a severe eye to dwell on him , though his glance traveled instantly to the egg-shell dome of Otto Schmidt , whose aid had been invaluable in stilling certain qualms in the breast of authority .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 28]: `` My singularly boisterous and most esteemed friend , Mr. Clancy , '' he continued , `` seems to be delighted by the success of that trope .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 32]: I might gladden your hearts with some which he has coined , because the bride and bridegroom owe more , far more , to him than they imagine at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 12]: I remember -- '' A loud `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 8]: from Clancy indicated that revelations were imminent .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 108]: `` Well , '' said Steingall , `` I forget just what he said on one memorable night when four semi-intoxicated stokers held up a downtown saloon , but I do wish to assure you of this -- if it were not for Clancy 's genius as a detective , and his splendid qualities of heart and mind as a man , this wedding might never have taken place , or , if that is putting a strain on your imagination , let me say that its principals would have encountered difficulties which are now , happily , the dim ghosts of what might have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 31]: Curtis took an opportunity later to ask Steingall what those cryptic words meant , and the Chief of the Bureau set at rest a doubt which had long perplexed him .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 22]: `` It was Clancy who prompted the idea of mixing up the two branches of the inquiry , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 14]: `` Under that wizened skin of his he has a heart of gold .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 13]: ` Why should n't those two young people be made happy ? '
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 4]: he said . '
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 37]: I have n't seen the girl , ' nor had he , then , ` but I like Curtis , and she wo n't get a better husband if she searches the island of Manhattan . '
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 64]: So we allowed Lord Valletort and the Count to believe that it was their set of hirelings who killed poor Hunter , whereas Balusky and Viviadi only tied up de Courtois , and were quaking with fear when they heard of the murder , because they assumed he had been killed by some other scoundrels , and that they would be held responsible .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 28]: It was they who gave us the names of Rossi and Martiny as the likely pair , and the bluff I threw with Lamotte came off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 9]: `` For whom were Rossi and Martiny acting ?
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 10]: You have never told me , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 7]: `` Do n't ask , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 12]: But I do n't mind giving you a sort of hint .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 32]: You know , better than I do probably , that Hungary is seething with revolutionary parties , which are more bitter against each other than against the common enemy , Austria .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 88]: Now , two of these organizations were keen to have Count Vassilan married to Lady Hermione , one because of a patriotic desire to draw her money into the war-chest , the other because they suspected him , and rightly , as a mere tool in the hands of Austria , and they believed , again with justice I think , that when he was married it would be Paris and the gay life for him rather than a throne which might be shattered by Austrian bullets .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 23]: The Earl of Valletort has degenerated into little better than a company-promoter , and he had made his own compact with Vassilan .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 28]: Add to these certain facts one other -- Elizabeth Zapolya , whom Lady Hermione knows , married an attaché in the Austrian Embassy in Paris last week .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 4]: Tell her that .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 5]: She will be interested .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 12]: For the rest , you must deduce your own theories . ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 7]: Curtis remained silent for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 11]: Then he seized Steingall 's hand and wrung it warmly .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 27]: `` Hermione and I have been wondering what we can do to show our sense of gratitude to you and Mr. Clancy , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 11]: `` Nothing , sir , '' broke in the detective .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 15]: `` It was all in the way of business , so to speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 20]: `` Yes , and our recognition of your services will take shape in that direction , '' said Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 49]: `` Why , man , if it were not for you I might have been charged with murder , and if it were not for Clancy and you , Hermione might now be in Paris with her good-for-nothing father ... I 'll talk this over with Schmidt . ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 28]: `` Schmidt is a good fellow , but he does n't know everything , even though he may be a mighty fine guesser , '' said Steingall .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 19]: `` I 'll tell him just as much as is good for any lawyer , '' laughed Curtis .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 20]: `` He is acting for my wife and myself now in the matter of providing for Hunter 's relatives .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 16]: We look forward to meeting Clancy and you when we return from the West . ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 12]: `` Is that where you are going for the honeymoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 14]: asked the detective , with the amiable grin which invariably accompanies the question .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 30]: We debated the point during a whole day , but some enterprising agent settled it for us by exhibiting a catchy sign -- ` Why not see America ? '
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 9]: And we both cried ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 41]: Mr. Devar senior , who has what you call a pull in such matters , has secured us the use of a railway president 's car for the trip , and a whole lot of friends join us at Chicago .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 7]: Can you come , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 5]: Steingall shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 10]: `` No , sir , '' he said ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 9]: `` I ca n't get away from headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 7]: I have too much on hand .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 14]: As for Clancy , he 'll be carried out before he quits . ''
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 41]: So , for two people at least , a wonderful night merged into a more wonderful month , and the dawn of a new year found them on the threshold of a happy , and therefore , quite wonderful life .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 2]: THE END
