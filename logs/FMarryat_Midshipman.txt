Parsing [sent. 1 len. 21]: MR MIDSHIPMAN EASY By FREDERICK MARRYAT -LRB- 1792-1848 -RRB- CHAPTER I Which the reader will find very easy to read .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 24]: Mr Nicodemus Easy was a gentleman who lived down in Hampshire ; he was a married man , and in very easy circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 21]: Most couples find it very easy to have a family , but not always quite so easy to maintain them .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 36]: Mr Easy was not at all uneasy on the latter score , as he had no children ; but he was anxious to have them , as most people covet what they can not obtain .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 14]: After ten years , Mr Easy gave it up as a bad job .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 59]: Philosophy is said to console a man under disappointment , although Shakespeare asserts that it is no remedy for toothache ; so Mr Easy turned philosopher , the very best profession a man can take up , when he is fit for nothing else ; he must be a very incapable person indeed who can not talk nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 80]: For some time , Mr Easy could not decide upon what description his nonsense should consist of ; at last he fixed upon the rights of man , equality , and all that ; how every person was born to inherit his share of the earth , a right at present only admitted to a certain length ; that is , about six feet , for we all inherit our graves and are allowed to take possession without dispute .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 11]: But no one would listen to Mr Easy 's philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 49]: The women would not acknowledge the rights of men , whom they declared always to be in the wrong ; and , as the gentlemen who visited Mr Easy were all men of property , they could not perceive the advantages of sharing with those who had none .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 17]: However , they allowed him to discuss the question , while they discussed his port wine .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 24]: The wine was good , if the arguments were not , and we must take things as we find them in this world .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 34]: While Mr Easy talked philosophy , Mrs Easy played patience , and they were a very happy couple , riding side by side on their hobbies , and never interfering with each other .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 43]: Mr Easy knew his wife could not understand him , and therefore did not expect her to listen very attentively ; and Mrs Easy did not care how much her husband talked , provided she was not put out in her game .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 8]: Mutual forbearance will always ensure domestic felicity .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 10]: There was another cause for their agreeing so well .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 56]: Upon any disputed question Mr Easy invariably gave it up to Mrs Easy , telling her that she should have her own way and this pleased his wife ; but , as Mr Easy always took care , when it came to the point , to have his way , he was pleased as well .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 63]: It is true that Mrs Easy had long found out that she did not have her own way long ; but she was of an easy disposition , and as , in nine cases out of ten , it was of very little consequence how things were done , she was quite satisfied with his submission during the heat of the argument .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 28]: Mr Easy had admitted that she was right , and if like all men he would do wrong , why , what could a poor woman do ?
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 26]: With a lady of such a quiet disposition , it is easy to imagine that the domestic felicity of Mr Easy was not easily disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 16]: But , as people have observed before , there is a mutability in human affairs .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 26]: It was at the finale of the eleventh year of their marriage that Mrs Easy at first complained that she could not enjoy her breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 68]: Mrs Easy had her own suspicions , everybody else considered it past doubt , all except Mr Easy ; he little `` thought , good easy man , that his greatness was ripening '' ; he had decided that to have an heir was no Easy task , and it never came into his calculations , that there could be a change in his wife 's figure .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 33]: You might have added to it , subtracted from it , divided it , or multiplied it , but as it was a zero , the result would be always the same .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 51]: Mrs Easy also was not quite sure -- she believed it might be the case , there was no saying ; it might be a mistake , like that of Mrs Trunnion 's in the novel , and , therefore , she said nothing to her husband about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 68]: At last Mr Easy opened his eyes , and when , upon interrogating his wife , he found out the astounding truth , he opened his eyes still wider , and then he snapped his fingers and danced , like a bear upon hot plates , with delight , thereby proving that different causes may produce similar effects in two instances at one and the same time .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 53]: The bear dances from pain , Mr Easy from pleasure ; and again , when we are indifferent , or do not care for anything , we snap our fingers at it , and when we are overjoyed , and obtain what we most care for , we also snap our fingers .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 72]: Two months after Mr Easy snapped his fingers , Mrs Easy felt no inclination to snap hers , either from indifference or pleasure , The fact was , that Mrs Easy 's time was come , to undergo what Shakespeare pronounces the pleasing punishment that women bears but Mrs Easy , like the rest of her sex , declared `` that all men were liars , '' and most particularly poets .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 13]: But while Mrs Easy was suffering , Mr Easy was in ecstasies .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 22]: He laughed at pain , as all philosophers do when it is suffered by other people , and not by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 26]: In due course of time , Mrs Easy presented her husband with a fine boy , whom we present to the public as our hero .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 15]: CHAPTER II In which Mrs Easy , as usual , has her own way .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 50]: It was the fourth day after Mrs Easy 's confinement that Mr Easy , who was sitting by her bedside in an easy chair , commenced as follows : `` I have been thinking , my dear Mrs Easy , about the name I shall give this child . ''
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 6]: `` Name , Mr Easy !
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 13]: why , what name should you give it but your own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 28]: `` Not so , my dear , '' replied Mr Easy ; `` they call all names proper names , but I think that mine is not .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 11]: It is the very worst name in the calendar . ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 14]: `` Why , what 's the matter with it , Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 11]: `` The matter affects me as well as the boy .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 16]: Nicodemus is a long name to write at full length , and Nick is vulgar .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 34]: Besides , as there will be two Nicks , they will naturally call my boy young Nick , and of course I shall be styled old Nick , which will be diabolical . ''
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 17]: `` Well , Mr Easy , at all events then let me choose the name . ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 24]: `` That you shall , my dear , and it was with this view that I have mentioned the subject so early . ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 24]: `` I think , Mr Easy , I will call the boy after my poor father -- his name shall be Robert . ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 17]: `` Very well , my dear , if you wish it , it shall be Robert .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 7]: You shall have your own way .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 23]: But I think , my dear , upon a little consideration , you will acknowledge that there is a decided objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 7]: `` An objection Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 29]: `` Yes , my dear ; Robert may be very well , but you must reflect upon the consequences ; he is certain to be called Bob . ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 15]: `` Well , my dear , and suppose they do call him Bob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 12]: `` I can not bear even the supposition , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 17]: You forget the county in which we are residing , the downs covered with sheep . ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 18]: `` Why , Mr Easy , what can sheep have to do with a Christian name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 11]: `` There it is ; women never look to consequences .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 16]: My dear , they have a great deal to do with the name of Bob .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 24]: I will appeal to any farmer in the county , if ninety-nine shepherds ' dogs out of one hundred are not called Bob .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 23]: Now observe , your child is out of doors somewhere in the fields or plantations ; you want and you call him .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 10]: Instead of your child , what do you find ?
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 30]: Why , a dozen curs at least , who come running up to you , all answering to the name of Bob , and wagging their stumps of tails .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 16]: You see , Mrs Easy , it is a dilemma not to be got over .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 33]: You level your only son to the brute creation by giving him a Christian name which , from its peculiar brevity , has been monopolised by all the dogs in the county .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 25]: Any other name you please , my dear , but in this one instance you must allow me to lay my positive veto . ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 28]: `` Well , then , let me see -- but I 'll think of it , Mr Easy ; my head aches very much just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 10]: `` I will think for you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 8]: What do you say to John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 13]: `` O no , Mr Easy , such a common name . ''
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 10]: `` A proof of its popularity , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 22]: It is scriptural -- we have the Apostle and the Baptist -- we have a dozen Popes who were all Johns .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 27]: It is royal -- we have plenty of kings who were Johns -- and moreover , it is short , and sounds honest and manly . ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 17]: `` Yes , very true , my dear ; but they will call him Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 13]: `` Well , we have had several celebrated characters who were Jacks .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 34]: There was -- let me see -- Jack the Giant Killer , and Jack of the Bean Stock -- and Jack -- Jack -- '' `` Jack Spratt , '' replied Mrs Easy .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 64]: `` And Jack Cade , Mrs Easy , the great rebel -- and Three-fingered Jack , Mrs Easy , the celebrated negro -- and , above all , Jack Falstaff , ma'am , Jack Falstaff -- honest Jack Falstaff -- witty Jack Falstaff -- '' `` I thought , Mr Easy , that I was to be permitted to choose the name . ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 17]: `` Well , so you shall , my dear ; I give it up to you .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 17]: Do just as you please ; but depend upon it that John is the right name .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 9]: Is it not now , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 37]: `` It 's the way you always treat me , Mr Easy ; you say that you give it up , and that I shall have my own way , but I never do have it .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 12]: I am sure that the child will be christened John . ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 14]: `` Nay , my dear , it shall be just what you please .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 23]: Now I recollect it , there were several Greek emperors who were Johns ; but decide for yourself , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 30]: `` No , no , '' replied Mrs Easy , who was ill , and unable to contend any longer , `` I give it up , Mr Easy .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 40]: I know how it will be , as it always is : you give me my own way as people give pieces of gold to children , it 's their own money , but they must not spend it .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 6]: Pray call him John . ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 20]: `` There , my dear , did not I tell you you would be of my opinion upon reflection ?
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 5]: I knew you would .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 34]: I have given you your own way , and you tell me to call him John ; so now we 're both of the same mind , and that point is settled . ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 19]: `` I should like to go to sleep , Mr Easy ; I feel far from well . ''
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 27]: `` You shall always do just as you like , my dear , '' replied the husband , `` and have your own way in everything .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 14]: It is the greatest pleasure I have when I yield to your wishes .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 7]: I will walk in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 6]: Good-bye , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 13]: Mrs Easy made no reply , and the philosopher quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 16]: As may easily be imagined , on the following day the boy was christened John .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 15]: CHAPTER III In which our hero has to wait the issue of an argument .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 26]: The reader may observe that , in general , all my first chapters are very short , and increase in length as the work advances .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 12]: I mention this as a proof of my modesty and diffidence .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 26]: At first , I am like a young bird just out of its mother 's nest , pluming my little feathers and taking short flights .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 16]: By degrees I obtain more confidence , and wing my course over hill and dale .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 14]: It is very difficult to throw any interest into a chapter on childhood .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 12]: There is the same uniformity in all children until they develop .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 39]: We can not , therefore , say much relative to Jack Easy 's earliest days ; he sucked and threw up his milk while the nurse blessed it for a pretty dear , slept , and sucked again .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 28]: He crowed in the morning like a cock , screamed when he was washed , stared at the candle , and made wry faces with the wind .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 16]: Six months passed in these innocent amusements , and then he was put into shorts .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 33]: But I ought here to have remarked , that Mrs Easy did not find herself equal to nursing her own infant , and it was necessary to look out for a substitute .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 75]: Now a common-place person would have been satisfied with the recommendation of the medical man , who looks but to the one thing needful , which is a sufficient and wholesome supply of nourishment for the child ; but Mr Easy was a philosopher , and had latterly taken to craniology , and he descanted very learnedly with the Doctor upon the effect of his only son obtaining his nutriment from an unknown source .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 29]: `` Who knows , '' observed Mr Easy , `` but that my son may not imbibe with his milk the very worst passions of human nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 19]: `` I have examined her , '' replied the Doctor , `` and can safely recommend her . ''
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 16]: `` That examination is only preliminary to one more important , '' replied Mr Easy .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 7]: `` I must examine her . ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 8]: `` Examine who , Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 13]: exclaimed his wife , who had lain down again on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 8]: `` The nurse , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 8]: `` Examine what , Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 4]: continued the lady .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 12]: `` Her head , my dear , '' replied the husband .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 10]: `` I must ascertain what her propensities are . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 13]: `` I think you had better leave her alone , Mr Easy .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 13]: She comes this evening , and I shall question her pretty severely .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 13]: Doctor Middleton , what do you know of this young person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 23]: `` I know , madam , that she is very healthy and strong , or I should not have selected her . ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 8]: `` But is her character good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 21]: `` Really , madam , I know little about her character ; but you can make any inquiries you please .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 30]: But at the same time I ought to observe , that if you are too particular in that point , you will have some difficulty in providing yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 12]: `` Well , I shall see , '' replied Mrs Easy .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 11]: `` And I shall feel , '' rejoined the husband .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 26]: This parleying was interrupted by the arrival of the very person in question , who was announced by the housemaid , and was ushered in .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 37]: She was a handsome , florid , healthy-looking girl , awkward and naive in her manner , and apparently not over wise ; there was more of the dove than of the serpent in her composition .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 19]: Mr Easy , who was very anxious to make his own discoveries , was the first who spoke .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 16]: `` Young woman , come this way , I wish to examine your head . ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 16]: dear me , sir , it 's quite clean , I assure you , '' .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 8]: cried the girl , dropping a curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 20]: Doctor Middleton , who sat between the bed and Mr Easy 's chair , rubbed his hands and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 44]: In the meantime , Mr Easy had untied the string and taken off the cap of the young woman , and was very busy putting his fingers through her hair , during which the face of the young woman expressed fear and astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 16]: `` I am glad to perceive that you have a large portion of benevolence . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' replied the young woman , dropping a curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 6]: `` And veneration also . ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 6]: `` Thanky , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 11]: `` And the organ of modesty is strongly developed . ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied the girl with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 13]: `` That 's quite a new organ , '' thought Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 6]: `` Philoprogenitiveness very powerful . ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 23]: `` If you please , sir , I do n't know what that is , '' answered Sarah , with a curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 11]: `` Nevertheless you have given us a practical , illustration .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 7]: Mrs Easy , I am satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 7]: Have you any questions to ask ?
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 7]: But it is quite unnecessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 10]: `` To be sure I have , Mr Easy .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 11]: Pray , young woman , what is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 10]: `` Sarah , if you please , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 9]: `` How long have you been married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 6]: `` Married , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 6]: `` Yes , married . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 24]: `` If you please , ma'am , I had a misfortune , ma'am , '' replied the girl , casting down her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 10]: `` What , have you not been married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 9]: `` No , ma'am , not yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 4]: `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 14]: Dr Middleton , what can you mean by bringing this person here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs Easy .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 13]: `` Not a married woman , and she has a child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 26]: `` If you please , ma'am , '' interrupted the young woman , dropping a curtsey , `` it was a very little one . ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 7]: `` A very little one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs Easy .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 19]: `` Yes , ma'am , very small , indeed , and died soon after it was born . ''
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 6]: `` Oh , Dr Middleton !
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 10]: -- what could you mean , Dr Middleton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 48]: `` My dear madam , '' exclaimed the Doctor , rising from his chair , `` this is the only person that I could find suited to the wants of your child , and if you do not take her I can not answer for its life .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 84]: It is true , that a married woman might be procured ; but married women , who have a proper feeling , will not desert their own children ; and as Mr Easy asserts , and you appear to imagine , the temper and disposition of your child may be affected by the nourishment it receives , I think it more likely to be injured by the milk of a married woman who will desert her own child for the sake of gain .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 32]: The misfortune which has happened to this young woman is not always a proof of a bad heart , but of strong attachment , and the overweening confidence of simplicity . ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 40]: `` You are correct , Doctor , '' replied Mr Easy , `` and her head proves that she is a modest young woman , with strong religious feeling , kindness of disposition , and every other requisite . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 23]: `` The head may prove it all for what I know , Mr Easy , but her conduct tells another tale . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 16]: `` She is well fitted for the situation , ma'am , '' continued the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 21]: `` And if you please , ma'am , '' rejoined Sarah , `` it was such a little one . ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 10]: `` Shall I try the baby , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 11]: said the monthly nurse , who had listened in silence .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 21]: `` It is fretting so , poor thing , and has its dear little fist right down its throat . ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 26]: Dr Middleton gave the signal of assent , and in a few seconds Master John Easy was fixed to Sarah as tight as a leech .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 10]: `` Lord love it , how hungry it is !
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 18]: -- there , there , stop it a moment , it 's choking , poor thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 19]: Mrs Easy , who was lying on her bed , rose up , and went to the child .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 36]: Her first feeling was that of envy , that another should have such a pleasure which was denied to herself ; the next , that of delight , at the satisfaction expressed by the infant .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 13]: In a few minutes the child fell back in a deep sleep .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 17]: Mrs Easy was satisfied ; maternal feelings conquered all others , and Sarah was duly installed .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 20]: To make short work of it , we have said that Jack Easy in six months was in shorts .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 92]: He soon afterwards began to crawl and show his legs ; indeed , so indecorously , that it was evident that he had imbibed no modesty with Sarah 's milk , neither did he appear to have gained veneration or benevolence , for he snatched at everything , squeezed the kitten to death , scratched his mother , and pulled his father by the hair ; notwithstanding all which , both his father and mother and the whole household declared him to be the finest and sweetest child in the universe .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 53]: But if we were to narrate all the wonderful events of Jack 's childhood from the time of his birth up to the age of seven years , as chronicled by Sarah , who continued his dry nurse after he had been weaned , it would take at least three volumes folio .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 26]: Jack was brought up in the way that every only child usually is -- that is , he was allowed to have his own way .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 18]: CHAPTER IV In which the doctor prescribes going to school as a remedy for a cut finger .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 16]: `` Have you no idea of putting the boy to school , Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 49]: said Dr Middleton , who had been summoned by a groom with his horse in a foam to attend immediately at Forest Hill , the name of Mr Easy 's mansion , and who , upon his arrival , had found that Master Easy had cut his thumb .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 50]: One would have thought that he had cut his head off by the agitation pervading the whole household -- Mr Easy walking up and down very uneasy , Mrs Easy with great difficulty prevented from syncope , and all the maids bustling and passing round Mrs Easy 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 37]: Everybody appeared excited except Master Jack Easy himself , who , with a rag round his finger , and his pinafore spotted with blood , was playing at bob-cherry , and cared nothing about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 13]: `` Well , what 's the matter , my little man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 21]: said Dr Middleton , on entering , addressing himself to Jack , as the most sensible of the whole party .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 55]: `` Oh , Dr Middleton , '' interrupted Mrs Easy , `` he has cut his hand ; I 'm sure that a nerve is divided , and then the lock-jaw -- '' The Doctor made no reply , but examined the finger : Jack Easy continued to play bob-cherry with his right hand .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 18]: `` Have you such a thing as a piece of sticking-plaster in the house , madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 7]: observed the Doctor , after examination .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 13]: `` O yes : run , Mary , run , Sarah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 20]: In a few seconds the maids appeared , Sarah bringing the sticking-plaster , and Mary following with the scissors .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 30]: `` Make yourself quite easy , madam , '' said Dr Middleton , after he put on the plaster , `` I will answer for no evil consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 18]: `` Had I not better take him upstairs , and let him lie down a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 13]: replied Mrs Easy , slipping a guinea into the Doctor 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 29]: `` It is not absolutely requisite , madam , '' said the Doctor ; `` but at all events he will be kept out of more mischief . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 14]: `` Come , my dear , you hear what Dr Middleton says . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 18]: `` Yes , I heard , '' replied Jack ; `` but I sha n't go . ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 17]: `` My dear Johnny -- come , love -- now do , my dear Johnny . ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 9]: Johnny played bob-cherry , and made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 10]: `` Come , Master Johnny , '' said Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 14]: `` Go away , Sarah , '' said Johnny , with a backhander .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 9]: fie , Master Johnny , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 24]: `` Johnny , my love , '' said Mrs Easy in a coaxing tone , `` come now -- will you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 18]: `` I 'll go in the garden and get some more cherries , '' replied Master Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 15]: `` Come , then , love , we will go into the garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 15]: Master Johnny jumped off his chair , and took his mamma by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 13]: `` What a dear , good , obedient child it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 14]: exclaimed Mrs Easy ; `` you may lead him with a thread . ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 12]: `` Yes , to pick cherries , '' thought Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 33]: Mrs Easy , and Johnny , and Sarah , and Mary , went into the garden , leaving Dr Middleton alone with Mr Easy , who had been silent during this scene .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 19]: Now Dr Middleton was a clever , sensible man , who had no wish to impose upon anyone .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 23]: As for his taking a guinea for putting on a piece of sticking-plaster , his conscience was very easy on that score .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 25]: His time was equally valuable , whether he were employed for something or nothing ; and , moreover , he attended the poor gratis .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 55]: Constantly in the house , he had seen much of Mr John Easy , and perceived that he was a courageous , decided boy , of a naturally good disposition ; but from the idiosyncrasy of the father , and the doting folly of the mother , in a sure way of being spoiled .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 35]: As soon , therefore , as the lady was out of hearing , he took a chair , and made the query at the commencement of the chapter , which we shall now repeat .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 16]: `` Have you no idea of putting the boy to school , Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 28]: Mr Easy crossed his legs , and clasped his hands together over his knees , as he always did when he was about to commence an argument .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 49]: `` The great objection that I have to sending a boy to school , Dr Middleton , is , that I conceive that the discipline enforced is , not only contrary to the rights of man , but also in opposition to all sound sense and common judgment .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 42]: Not content with punishment , which is in itself erroneous , and an infringement of social justice , they even degrade the minds of the boys still more by applying punishment to the most degraded part , adding contumely to tyranny .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 78]: Of course , it is intended that a boy who is sent to school should gain by precept and example ; but is he to learn benevolence by the angry look and the flourish of the vindictive birch , -- or forbearance , by the cruelty of the ushers , -- or patience , when the masters over him are out of all patience , or modesty , when his nether parts are exposed to general examination ?
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 25]: Is he not daily reading a lesson at variance with that equality which we all possess , but of which we are unjustly deprived ?
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 13]: Why should there be a distinction between the flogger and the floggee ?
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 38]: Are they not both fashioned alike after God 's image , endowed with the same reason , having an equal right to what the world offers , and which was intended by Providence to be equally distributed ?
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 50]: Is it not that the sacred inheritance of all , which has tyrannously and impiously been ravished from the many for the benefit of the few , and which ravishment , from long custom of iniquity and inculcation of false precepts , has too long been basely submitted to ?
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 42]: Is it not the duty of a father to preserve his only son from imbibing these dangerous and debasing errors , which will render him only one of a vile herd who are content to suffer , provided that they live ?
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 21]: And yet are not these very errors inculcated at school , and impressed upon their mind inversely by the birch ?
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 68]: Do not they there receive their first lesson in slavery with the first lesson in A B C ; and are not their minds thereby prostrated , so as never to rise again , but ever to bow to despotism , to cringe to rank , to think and act by the precepts of others , and to tacitly disavow that sacred equality which is our birthright ?
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 27]: No , sir , without they can teach without resorting to such a fundamental error as flogging , my boy shall never go to school . ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 23]: And Mr Easy threw himself back in his chair , imagining like all philosophers , that he had said something very clever .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 17]: Dr Middleton knew his man , and therefore patiently waited until he had exhausted his oratory .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 59]: `` I will grant , '' said the Doctor at last , `` that all you say may have great truth in it ; but , Mr Easy , do you not think that by not permitting a boy to be educated , you allow him to remain more open to that very error of which you speak ?
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 21]: It is only education which will conquer prejudice , and enable a man to break through the trammels of custom .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 56]: Now , allowing that the birch is used , yet it is at a period when the young mind is so elastic as to soon become indifferent ; and after he has attained the usual rudiments of education , you will then find him prepared to receive those lessons which you can yourself instil . ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 20]: `` I will teach him everything myself , '' replied Mr Easy , folding his arms consequentially and determinedly .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 26]: `` I do not doubt your capability , Mr Easy ; but unfortunately you will always have a difficulty which you never can get over .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 57]: Excuse me , I know what you are capable of , and the boy would indeed be happy with such a preceptor , but -- if I must speak plain -- you must be aware as well as I am , that the maternal fondness of Mrs Easy will always be a bar to your intention .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 23]: He is already so spoiled by her , that he will not obey ; and without obedience you can not inculcate . ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 29]: `` I grant , my dear sir , that there is a difficulty on that point ; but maternal weakness must then be overcome by paternal severity . ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 9]: `` May I ask how , Mr Easy ?
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 8]: for it appears to me impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 3]: `` Impossible !
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 43]: By heavens , I 'll make him obey , or I 'll -- '' -- Here Mr Easy stopped before the word flog was fairly out of his mouth , -- `` I 'll know the reason why , Dr Middleton . ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 43]: Dr Middleton checked his inclination to laugh , and replied , `` That you would hit upon some scheme , by which you would obtain the necessary power over him , I have no doubt ; but what will be the consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 16]: The boy will consider his mother as a protector , and you as a tyrant .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 33]: He will have an aversion to you , and with that aversion he will never pay respect and attention to your valuable precepts when he arrives at an age to understand them .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 17]: Now it appears to me that this difficulty which you have raised may be got over .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 58]: I know a very worthy clergyman who does not use the birch ; but I will write , and put the direct question to him ; and then if your boy is removed from the danger arising from Mrs Easy 's overindulgence , in a short time he will be ready for your more important tuition . ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 21]: `` I think , '' replied Mr Easy , after a pause , `` that what you say merits consideration .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 52]: I acknowledge that in consequence of Mrs Easy 's nonsensical indulgence , the boy is unruly , and will not obey me at present ; and if your friend does not apply the rod , I will think seriously of sending my son John to him to learn the elements . ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 11]: The Doctor had gained his point by flattering the philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 58]: In a day he returned with a letter from the pedagogue in answer to one supposed to be sent to him , in which the use of the birch was indignantly disclaimed , and Mr Easy announced to his wife , when they met that day at tea-time , his intentions with regard to his son John .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 7]: `` To school , Mr Easy ?
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 7]: what , send Johnny to school !
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 7]: a mere infant to school ! ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 25]: `` Surely , my dear , you must be aware that at nine years it is high time that he learnt to read . ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 17]: `` Why he almost reads already , Mr Easy ; surely I can teach him that .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 7]: Does he not , Sarah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 17]: `` Lord bless him , yes , ma'am , he was saying his letters yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 15]: `` Oh , Mr Easy , what can have put this in your head ?
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 16]: Johnny , dear , come here -- tell me now what 's the letter A ?
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 11]: You were singing it in the garden this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 27]: `` I want some sugar , '' replied Johnny , stretching his arm over the table to the sugar-basin , which was out of his reach .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 43]: `` Well , my love , you shall have a great lump if you will tell me what 's the letter A. '' `` A was an archer , and shot at a frog , '' replied Johnny in a surly tone .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 23]: `` There now , Mr Easy ; and he can go through the whole alphabet -- ca n't he , Sarah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 16]: `` That he can , the dear -- ca n't you , Johnny dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 7]: `` No , '' replied Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 17]: `` Yes , you can , my love ; you know what 's the letter B .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 6]: Now do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' replied Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 20]: `` There , Mr Easy , you see what the boy knows , and how obedient he is too .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 12]: Come , Johnny dear , tell us what was B ? ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 38]: `` No , I wo n't , '' replied Johnny , `` I want some more sugar '' ; and Johnny , who had climbed on a chair , spread himself over the table to reach it .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 3]: `` Mercy !
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 17]: Sarah , pull him off -- he 'll upset the urn , '' screamed Mrs Easy .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 49]: Sarah caught hold of Johnny by the loins to pull him back , but Johnny , resisting the interference , turned round on his back as he lay on the table , and kicked Sarah in the face , just as she made another desperate grasp at him .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 76]: The rebound from the kick , given as he lay on a smooth mahogany table , brought Johnny 's head in contact with the urn , which was upset in the opposite direction , and , notwithstanding a rapid movement on the part of Mr Easy , he received a sufficient portion of boiling liquid on his legs to scald him severely , and induce him to stamp and swear in a very unphilosophical way .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 26]: In the meantime Sarah and Mrs Easy had caught up Johnny , and were both holding him at the same time , exclaiming and lamenting .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 26]: The pain of the scald , and the indifference shown towards him , were too much for Mr Easy 's temper to put up with .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 24]: He snatched Johnny out of their arms , and , quite forgetting his equality and rights of man , belaboured him without mercy .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 27]: Sarah flew into interfere , and received a blow which not only made her see a thousand stars , but sent her reeling on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 22]: Mrs Easy went off into hysterics , and Johnny howled so as to be heard at a quarter of a mile .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 37]: How long Mr Easy would have continued it is impossible to say ; but the door opened , and Mr Easy looked up while still administering the punishment , and perceived Dr Middleton in mute astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 44]: He had promised to come in to tea , and enforce Mr Easy 's arguments , if it were necessary ; but it certainly appeared to him , that in the argument which Mr Easy was then enforcing , he required no assistance .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 63]: However , at the entrance of Dr Middleton , Johnny was dropped , and lay roaring on the floor ; Sarah , too , remained where she had been floored , Mrs Easy had rolled on the floor , the urn was also on the floor , and Mr Easy , although not floored , had not a leg to stand upon .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 10]: Never did a medical man look in more opportunely .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 24]: Mr Easy at first was not certainly of that opinion , but his legs became so painful that he soon became a convert .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 21]: Dr Middleton , as in duty bound , first picked up Mrs Easy , and laid her on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 30]: Sarah rose , picked up Johnny , and carried him , kicking and roaring , out of the room ; in return for which attention she received sundry bites .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 23]: The footman , who had announced the doctor , picked up the urn , that being all that was in his department .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 79]: Mr Easy threw himself panting in agony on the other sofa , and Dr Middleton was excessively embarrassed how to act : he perceived that Mr Easy required his assistance , and that Mrs Easy could do without it ; but how to leave a lady , who was half really and half pretendedly in hysterics , was difficult ; for if he attempted to leave her , she kicked and flounced , and burst out the more .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 43]: At last Dr Middleton rang the bell , which brought the footman , who summoned all the maids , who carried Mrs Easy upstairs , and then the Doctor was able to attend to the only patient who really required his assistance .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 22]: Mr Easy explained the affair in few words , broken into ejaculations from pain , as the Doctor removed his stockings .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 43]: From the applications of Dr Middleton , Mr Easy soon obtained bodily relief ; but what annoyed him still more than his scalded legs , was the Doctor having been a witness to his infringement of the equality and rights of man .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 17]: Dr Middleton perceived this , and he knew also how to pour balm into that wound .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 53]: `` My dear Mr Easy , I am very sorry that you have had this accident , for which you are indebted to Mrs Easy 's foolish indulgence of the boy ; but I am glad to perceive that you have taken up those parental duties which are inculcated by the Scriptures .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 104]: Solomon says , ` that he who spares the rod , spoils the child , ' thereby implying that it is the duty of a father to correct his children , and in a father , the so doing does not interfere with the rights of man , or any natural equality , for the son being a part or portion of the father , he is only correcting his own self ; and the proof of it is , that a father , in punishing his own son , feels as much pain in so doing as if he were himself punished .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 19]: It is , therefore , nothing but self-discipline , which is strictly enjoined us by the Scriptures . ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 26]: `` That is exactly my opinion , '' replied Mr Easy , comforted at the Doctor having so logically got him out of the scrape .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 17]: `` But -- he shall go to school to-morrow , that I 'm determined on . ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 16]: `` He will have to thank Mrs Easy for that , '' replied the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 8]: `` Exactly , '' replied Mr Easy .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 12]: `` Doctor , my legs are getting very hot again . ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 28]: `` Continue to bathe them with the vinegar and water , Mr Easy , until I send you an embrocation , which will give you immediate relief .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 5]: I will call to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 29]: By-the-bye , I am to see a little patient at Mr Bonnycastle 's : if it is any accommodation , I will take your son with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 15]: `` It will be a great accommodation , Doctor , '' replied Mr Easy .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 27]: `` Then , my dear sir , I will just go up and see how Mrs Easy is , and to-morrow I will call at ten .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 6]: I can wait an hour .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 3]: Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 6]: `` Good-night , Doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 11]: The doctor had his game to play with Mrs Easy .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 31]: He magnified her husband 's accident -- he magnified his wrath , and advised her by no means to say one word , until he was well and more pacified .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 132]: The next day he repeated this dose , and , in spite of the ejaculations of Sarah , and the tears of Mrs Easy , who dared not venture to plead her cause , and the violent resistance of Master Johnny , who appeared to have a presentiment of what was to come , our hero was put into Dr Middleton 's chariot , and with the exception of one plate of glass , which he kicked out of the window with his feet , and for which feat the Doctor , now that he had him all to himself , boxed his ears till he was nearly blind , he was , without any further eventful occurrence , carried by the Doctor 's footman into the parlour of Mr Bonnycastle .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 16]: CHAPTER V Jack Easy is sent to a school at which there is no flogging .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 75]: Master Jack had been plumped down in a chair by the doctor 's servant , who , as he quitted him , first looked at his own hands , from which the blood was drawn in several parts , and then at Master Jack , with his teeth closed , and lips compressed , as much as to say , `` If I only dared , would not I , that 's all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 47]: and then walked out of the room , repaired to the carriage at the front door , when he showed his hands to the coachman , who looked down from his box in great commiseration , at the same time fully sharing his fellow-servant 's indignation .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 8]: But we must repair to the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 43]: Dr Middleton ran over a newspaper , while Johnny sat on the chair all of a heap , looking like a lump of sulks , with his feet on the upper front bar , and his knees almost up to his nose .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 8]: He was a promising pupil , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 44]: Mr Bonnycastle made his appearance -- a tall , well-built , handsome , fair man , with a fine powdered head , dressed in solemn black and knee buckles ; his linen beautifully clean , and with a peculiar bland expression of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 26]: When he smiled he showed a row of teeth white as ivory , and his mild blue eye was the ne plus ultra of beneficence .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 33]: He was the beau-ideal of a preceptor , and it was impossible to see him and hear his mild pleasing voice , without wishing that all your sons were under his protection .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 29]: He was a ripe scholar , and a good one , and at the time we speak of , had the care of upwards of one hundred boys .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 31]: He was celebrated for turning them out well , and many of his pupils were rising fast in the senate , as well as distinguishing themselves in the higher Professions .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 23]: Dr Middleton , who was on intimate terms with Bonnycastle , rose as he entered the room , and they shook hands .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 20]: Middleton then turned to where Jack sat , and pointing to him , said , `` Look there . ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 3]: Bonnycastle smiled .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 18]: `` I can not say that I have had worse , but I have almost as bad .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 14]: I will apply the Promethean torch , and soon vivify that rude mass .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 8]: Come , sit down , Middleton . ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 42]: `` But , '' said the Doctor , as he resumed his chair , `` tell me , Bonnycastle , how you will possibly manage to lick such a cub into shape , when you do not resort to flogging ? ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 17]: `` I have no opinion of flogging , and therefore I do not resort to it .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 16]: The fact is , I was at Harrow myself , and was rather a pickle .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 27]: I was called up as often as most boys in the school , and I perfectly recollect , that eventually I cared nothing for a flogging .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 5]: I had become case-hardened .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 14]: It is the least effective part that you can touch a boy upon .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 10]: It leaves nothing behind to refresh their memories . ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 8]: `` I should have thought otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 17]: `` My dear Middleton , I can produce more effect by one caning than twenty floggings .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 25]: Observe , you flog upon a part the most quiescent ; but you cane upon all parts , from the head to the heels .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 55]: Now , when once the first sting of the birch is over , then a dull sensation comes over the part , and the pain after that is nothing ; whereas a good sound caning leaves sores and bruises in every part , and on all the parts which are required for muscular action .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 71]: After a flogging , a boy may run out in the hours of recreation , and join his playmates as well as ever , but a good caning tells a very different tale ; he can not move one part of his body without being reminded for days by the pain of the punishment he has undergone , and he is very careful how he is called up again . ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 34]: `` My dear sir , I really had an idea that you were excessively lenient , '' replied Middleton , laughing ; `` I am glad that I am under a mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 34]: `` Look at that cub , Doctor , sitting there more like a brute than a reasonable being ; do you imagine that I could ever lick it into shape without strong measures ?
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 20]: At the same time , allow me to say , that I consider my system by far the best .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 47]: At the public schools , punishment is no check ; it is so trifling that it is derided : with me punishment is punishment in the true sense of the word , and the consequence is , that it is much more seldom resorted to . ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 9]: `` You are a terrorist , Bonnycastle . ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 13]: `` The two strongest impulses in our nature are fear and love .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 39]: In theory , acting upon the latter is very beautiful ; but in practice , I never found it to answer -- and for the best of reasons , our self-love is stronger than our love for others .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 32]: Now I never yet found fear to fail , for the very same reason that the other does , because with fear we act upon self-love , and nothing else . ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 28]: `` And yet we have many now who would introduce a system of schooling without correction ; and who maintain that the present system is degrading . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 14]: `` There are a great many fools in this world , Doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 39]: `` That reminds me of this boy 's father , '' replied Dr Middleton ; who then detailed to the pedagogue the idiosyncrasy of Mr Easy , and all the circumstances attending Jack being sent to his school .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 12]: `` There is no time to be lost then , Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 14]: I must conquer this young gentleman before his parents call to see him .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 18]: Depend upon it , in a week I will have him obedient and well broke in . ''
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 15]: Dr Middleton wished Jack good-bye , and told him to be a good boy .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 7]: Jack did not vouchsafe to answer .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 22]: `` Never mind , Doctor , he will be more polished next time you call here , depend upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 5]: And the Doctor departed .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 11]: Although Mr Bonnycastle was severe , he was very judicious .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 38]: Mischief of all kinds was visited but by slender punishment , such as being kept in at play hours , etc ; and he seldom interfered with the boys for fighting , although he checked decided oppression .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 15]: The great `` sine qua non '' with him was attention to their studies .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 36]: He soon discovered the capabilities of his pupils , and he forced them accordingly ; but the idle boy , the bird who `` could sing and would n't sing , '' received no mercy .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 55]: The consequence was , that he turned out the cleverest boys , and his conduct was so uniform and unvarying in its tenor , that if he was feared when they were under his control , he was invariably liked by those whom he had instructed , and they continued his friends in after-life .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 28]: Mr Bonnycastle at once perceived that it was no use coaxing our hero , and that fear was the only attribute by which he could be controlled .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 31]: So , as soon as Dr Middleton had quitted the room , he addressed him in a commanding tone , `` Now , boy , what is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 26]: Jack started ; he looked up at his master , perceived his eye fixed upon him , and a countenance not to be played with .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 29]: Jack was no fool , and somehow or another , the discipline he had received from his father had given him some intimation of what was to come .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 22]: All this put together induced Jack to condescend to answer , with his forefinger between his teeth , `` Johnny . ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 11]: `` And what is your other name , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 53]: Jack , who appeared to repent his condescension , did not at first answer , but he looked again in Mr Bonnycastle 's face , and then round the room : there was no one to help him , and he could not help himself , so he replied `` Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 12]: `` Do you know why you are sent to school ? ''
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 5]: `` Scalding father . ''
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 14]: `` No ; you are sent to learn to read and write . ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 15]: `` But I wo n't read and write , '' replied Jack , sulkily .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 18]: `` Yes , you will ; and you are going to read your letters now directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 5]: Jack made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 41]: Mr Bonnycastle opened a sort of bookcase , and displayed to John 's astonished view a series of canes , ranged up and down like billiard cues , and continued , `` Do you know what those are for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 27]: Jack eyed them wistfully ; he had some faint idea that he was sure to be better acquainted with them , but he made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 21]: `` They are to teach little boys to read and write , and now I am going to teach you .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 5]: You 'll soon learn .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 33]: Look now here , '' continued Mr Bonnycastle , opening a book with large type , and taking a capital at the head of a chapter , about half an inch long .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 8]: `` Do you see that letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' replied Johnny , turning his eyes away , and picking his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 13]: `` Well , that is the letter B. Do you see it ?
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 12]: look at it , so that you may know it again .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 6]: That 's the letter B .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 9]: Now tell me what letter that is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 12]: Jack now determined to resist , so he made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 33]: `` So you can not tell ; well , then , we will try what one of these little fellows will do , '' said Mr Bonnycastle , taking down a cane .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 17]: `` Observe , Johnny , that 's the letter B. Now , what letter is that ?
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 5]: Answer me directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 11]: `` I wo n't learn to read and write . ''
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 21]: Whack came the cane on Johnny 's shoulders , who burst out into a roar as he writhed with pain .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 7]: Mr Bonnycastle waited a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 7]: `` That 's the letter B .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 14]: Now tell me , sir , directly , what that letter is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 9]: `` I 'll tell my mar. '' Whack !
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 4]: `` O law !
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 4]: O law ! ''
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 7]: `` What letter is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 28]: Johnny , with his mouth open , panting , and the tears on his cheeks , answered , indignantly , `` Stop till I tell Sarah . ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 13]: Whack came the cane again , and a fresh burst from Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 7]: `` What letter 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 22]: `` I wo n't tell , '' roared Johnny ; `` I wo n't tell -- that I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 10]: Whack , whack , whack , and a pause .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 12]: `` I told you before , that 's the letter B .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 5]: What letter is that ?
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 5]: Tell me directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 14]: Johnny , by way of reply , made a snatch at the cane .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 17]: Whack , he caught it , certainly , but not exactly as he would have wished .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 17]: Johnny then snatched up the book , and dashed it to the corner of the room .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 4]: Whack , whack .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 10]: Johnny attempted to seize Mr Bonnycastle with his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 20]: Whack , whack , whack , whack ; and Johnny fell on the carpet , and roared with pain .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 18]: Mr Bonnycastle then left him for a little while , to recover himself , and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 43]: At last Johnny 's exclamations settled down in deep sobs , and then Mr Bonnycastle said to him , `` Now , Johnny , you perceive that you must do as you are bid , or else you will have more beating .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 4]: Get up immediately .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 7]: Do you hear , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 15]: Somehow or another , Johnny , without intending it , stood upon his feet .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 25]: `` That 's a good boy ; now you see , by getting up as you were bid , You have not been beaten .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 18]: Now , Johnny , you must go and bring the book from where you threw it down .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 6]: Do you hear , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 5]: bring it directly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 9]: Johnny looked at Mr Bonnycastle and the cane .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 18]: With every intention to refuse , Johnny picked up the book and laid it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 15]: `` That 's a good boy ; now we will find the letter B .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 16]: Here it is : now , Johnny , tell me what that letter is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 5]: Johnny made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 20]: `` Tell me directly , sir , '' said Mr Bonnycastle , raising his cane up in the air .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 6]: The appeal was too powerful .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 12]: Johnny eyed the cane ; it moved , it was coming .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 9]: Breathlessly he shrieked out , `` B ! ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 10]: `` Very well indeed , Johnny -- very well .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 14]: Now your first lesson is over , and you shall go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 9]: You have learned more than you think for .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 6]: To-morrow we will begin again .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 9]: Now we 'll put the cane by . ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 43]: Mr Bonnycastle rang the bell , and desired Master Johnny to be put to bed , in a room by himself , and not to give him any supper , as hunger would , the next morning , much facilitate his studies .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 27]: Pain and hunger alone will tame brutes , and the same remedy must be applied to conquer those passions in man which assimilate him with brutes .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 13]: Johnny was conducted to bed , although it was but six o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 33]: He was not only in pain , but his ideas were confused ; and no wonder , after all his life having been humoured and indulged never punished until the day before .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 66]: After all the caresses of his mother and Sarah , which he never knew the value of -- after stuffing himself all day long , and being tempted to eat till he turned away in satiety , to find himself without his mother , without Sarah , without supper covered with wheals , and , what was worse than all , without his own way .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 36]: No wonder Johnny was confused ; at the same time that he was subdued ; and , as Mr Bonnycastle had truly told him , he had learnt more than he had any idea of .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 19]: And what would Mrs Easy have said , had she known all this -- and Sarah , too ?
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 10]: And Mr Easy , with his rights of man ?
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 71]: At the very time that Johnny was having the devil driven out of him , they were consoling themselves with the idea , that , at all events , there was no birch used at Mr Bonnycastle 's , quite losing sight of the fact , that as there are more ways of killing a dog besides hanging him , so are there more ways of teaching than a posteriors .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 35]: Happy in their ignorance , they all went fast asleep , little dreaming that Johnny was already so far advanced in knowledge , as to have a tolerable comprehension of the mystery of cane .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 18]: As for Johnny , he had cried himself to sleep , at least six hours before them .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 23]: CHAPTER VI In which Jack makes essay of his father 's sublime philosophy , and arrives very near to truth at last .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 84]: The next morning Master Jack Easy was not only very sore , but very hungry , and as Mr Bonnycastle informed him that he would not only have plenty of cane , but also no breakfast , if he did not learn his letters , Johnny had wisdom enough to say the whole alphabet , for which he received a great deal of praise , the which , if he did not duly appreciate , he at all events infinitely preferred to beating .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 16]: Mr Bonnycastle perceived that he had conquered the boy by one hour 's well-timed severity .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 33]: He therefore handed him over to the ushers in the school , and as they were equally empowered to administer the needful impulse , Johnny very soon became a very tractable boy .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 22]: It may be imagined that the absence of Johnny was severely felt at home , but such was not the case .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 72]: In the first place , Dr Middleton had pointed out to Mrs Easy that there was no flogging at the school , and that the punishment received by Johnny from his father would very likely be repeated -- and in the next , although Mrs Easy thought that she never could have survived the parting with her own son , she soon found out that she was much happier without him .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 31]: A spoilt child is always a source of anxiety and worry , and after Johnny 's departure Mrs Easy found a quiet and repose much more suited to her disposition .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 46]: Gradually she weaned herself from him , and , satisfied with seeing him occasionally , and hearing the reports of Dr Middleton , she , at last , was quite reconciled to his being at school , and not coming back except during the holidays .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 49]: John Easy made great progress ; he had good natural abilities , and Mr Easy rubbed his hands when he saw the Doctor , saying , `` Yes , let them have him for a year or two longer , and then I 'll finish him myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 17]: Each vacation he had attempted to instil into Johnny 's mind the equal rights of man .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 37]: Johnny appeared to pay but little attention to his father 's discourses , but evidently showed that they were not altogether thrown away , as he helped himself to everything he wanted , without asking leave .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 46]: And thus was our hero educated until he arrived at the age of sixteen , when he was a stout , good-looking boy , with plenty to say for himself , -- indeed , when it suited his purpose , he could out-talk his father .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 11]: Nothing pleased Mr Easy so much as Jack 's loquacity .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 29]: `` That 's right ; argue the point , Jack -- argue the point , boy , '' would he say , as Jack disputed with his mother .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 33]: And then he would turn to the Doctor , rubbing his hands , and observe , `` Depend upon it , Jack will be a great , a very great man . ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 28]: And then he would call Jack and give him a guinea for his cleverness ; and at last Jack thought it a very clever thing to argue .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 52]: He never would attempt to argue with Mr Bonnycastle , because he was aware that Mr Bonnycastle 's arguments were too strong for him , but he argued with all the boys until it ended in a fight , which decided the point ; and he sometimes argued with the ushers .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 35]: In short , at the time we now speak of , which was at the breaking up of the Midsummer holidays , Jack was as full of argument as he was fond of it .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 34]: He would argue the point to the point of a needle , and he would divide that point into as many as there were days of the year , and argue upon each .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 23]: In short , there was no end to Jack 's arguing the point , although there seldom was point to his argument .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 43]: Jack had been fishing in the river , without any success , for a whole morning , and observed a large pond which had the appearance of being well stocked -- he cleared the park palings , and threw in his line .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 23]: He had pulled up several fine fish , when he was accosted by the proprietor , accompanied by a couple of keepers .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 14]: `` May I request the pleasure of your name , young gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 6]: said the proprietor to Jack .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 8]: Now Jack was always urbane and polite .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 17]: `` Certainly , sir ; my name is Easy , very much at your service . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 18]: `` And you appear to me to be taking it very easy , '' replied the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 18]: `` Pray , sir , may I enquire whether you are aware that you are trespassing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 29]: `` The word trespass , my dear sir , '' replied Jack , `` will admit of much argument , and I will divide it into three heads .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 20]: It implies , according to the conventional meaning , coming without permission upon the land or property of another .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 14]: Now , sir , the question may all be resolved in the following .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 8]: Was not the world made for all ?
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 26]: and has any one , or any portion of its inhabitants , an exclusive right to claim any part of it , as his property ?
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 20]: If you please , I have laid down the proposition , and we will now argue the point . ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 50]: The gentleman who accosted Jack had heard of Mr Easy and his arguments ; he was a humorist , and more inclined to laugh than to be angry ; at the same time that he considered it necessary to show Jack that under existing circumstances they were not tenable .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 49]: `` But , Mr Easy , allowing the trespass on the property to be venial , surely you do not mean to say that you are justified in taking my fish ; I bought the fish , and stocked the pond , and have fed them ever since .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 21]: You can not deny but that they are private property , and that to take them is a theft ? ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 32]: `` That will again admit of much ratiocination , my dear sir , '' replied Jack ; `` but , -- I beg your pardon , I have a fish . ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 51]: Jack pulled up a large carp , much to the indignation of the keepers , and to the amusement of their master , unhooked it , placed it in his basket , renewed his bait with the greatest sang , and then throwing in his line , resumed his discourse .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 22]: `` As I was observing , my dear sir , '' continued Jack , `` that will admit of much ratiocination .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 45]: All the creatures of the earth were given to man for his use -- man means mankind -- they were never intended to be made a monopoly of ; water is also the gift of heaven , and meant for the use of all .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 14]: We now come to the question how far the fish are your property .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 73]: If the fish only bred on purpose to please you , and make you a present of their stock , it might then require a different line of argument ; but as in breeding they only acted in obedience to an instinct with which they are endowed on purpose that they may supply man , I submit to you that you can not prove these fish to be yours more than mine .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 35]: As for feeding with the idea that they were your own , that is not an unusual case in this world , even when a man is giving bread and butter to his children .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 19]: Further -- but I have another bite -- I beg your pardon , my dear sir -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 6]: he 's off again . ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 22]: `` Then , Mr Easy , you mean to say that the world and its contents are made for all . ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 20]: `` Exactly , sir ; that is my father 's opinion , who is a very great philosopher . ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 18]: `` How then does your father account for some possessing property and others being without it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 15]: `` Because those who are the strongest have deprived those who are weaker . ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 24]: `` But would not that be always the case even if we were in that state of general inheritance which you have supposed ?
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 33]: For instance , allowing two men to chase the same animal , and both to come up to it at the same time , would not the strongest bear it off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 8]: `` I grant that , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 11]: `` Well , then , where is your equality ? ''
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 23]: `` That does not disprove that men were not intended to be equal ; it only proves that they are not so .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 34]: Neither does it disprove that everything was not made for the benefit of all ; it only proves that the strong will take advantage of the weak , which is very natural . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 8]: you grant that to be very natural .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 25]: Well , Mr Easy , I am glad to perceive that we are of one mind , and I trust we shall continue so .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 65]: You 'll observe that I and my keepers being three , we are the strong party in this instance , and admitting your argument , that the fish are as much yours as mine , still I take advantage of my strength to repossess myself of them , which is , as you say , very natural -- James , take those fish . ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 65]: `` If you please , '' interrupted Jack , `` we will argue that point -- '' `` Not at all ; I will act according to your own arguments -- I have the fish , but I now mean to have more -- that fishing-rod is as much mine as yours , and being the stronger party I will take possession of it .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 14]: James , William , take that fishing-rod , -- it is ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 68]: `` I presume you will first allow me to observe , '' replied Jack , `` that although I have expressed my opinion that the earth and the animals on it were made for us all , that I never yet have asserted , that what a man creates by himself , or has created for him for a consideration , is not his own property . ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 66]: `` I beg your pardon ; the trees that that rod was made from were made for us all , and if you , or any one for you , have thought proper to make it into a rod , it is no more my fault than it is that I have been feeding the fish , with the supposition that they were my own .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 37]: Everything being common , and it being but natural that the strong should take advantage of the weak , I must take that rod as my property , until I am dispossessed by one more powerful .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 40]: Moreover , being the stronger party , and having possession of this land , which you say does not belong to me more than to you -- I also shall direct my keepers to see you off this property .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 14]: James , take the rod -- see Mr Easy over the park palings .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 11]: Mr Easy , I wish you a good morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 30]: `` Sir , I beg your pardon , you have not yet heard all my arguments , '' replied Jack , who did not approve of the conclusions drawn .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 20]: `` I have no time to hear more , Mr Easy ; I wish you a good morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 13]: And the proprietor departed , leaving Jack in company with the keepers .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 15]: `` I 'll trouble you for that rod , master , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 16]: James was very busy stringing the fish through the gills upon a piece of osier .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 36]: `` At all events you will hear reason , '' said Jack : `` I have arguments -- '' `` I never heard no good arguments in favour of poaching , '' interrupted the keeper .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 11]: `` You 're an insolent fellow , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 20]: `` It is by paying such vagabonds as you that people are able to be guilty of injustice . ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 42]: `` It 's by paying us that the land a n't poached -- and if there be some excuse for a poor devil who is out of work , there be none for you , who call yourself a gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 23]: `` According to his account , as we be all equal , he be no more a gentleman than we be . ''
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 50]: `` Silence , you blackguard , I shall not condescend to argue with such as you : if I did , I could prove that you are a set of base slaves , who have just as much right to this property as your master or I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 12]: `` As you have , I dare say , master . ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 38]: `` As I have , you scoundrel ; this pond is as much my property , and so are the fish in it , as they are of your master , who has usurped the right . ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 24]: `` I say , James , what do you say , shall we put the young gentleman in possession of his property ? ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 8]: said William , winking to the other .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 21]: James took the hint , they seized Jack by the arms and legs , and soused him into the pond .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 15]: Jack arose after a deep submersion , and floundered on shore blowing and spluttering .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 39]: But in the meantime the keepers had walked away , carrying with them the rod and line , fish , and tin can of bait , laughing loudly at the practical joke which they had played our hero .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 29]: `` Well , '' thought Jack , `` either there must be some mistake in my father 's philosophy , or else this is a very wicked world .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 10]: I shall submit this case to my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 38]: And Jack received this reply -- `` I have told you before , Jack , that these important truths will not at present be admitted -- but it does not the less follow that they are true .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 44]: This is the age of iron , in which might has become right -- but the time will come when these truths will be admitted , and your father 's name will be more celebrated than that of any philosopher of ancient days .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 55]: Recollect , Jack , that although in preaching against wrong and advocating the rights of man , you will be treated as a martyr , it is still your duty to persevere ; and if you are dragged through all the horse -- ponds in the kingdom , never give up your argument . ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 46]: `` That I never will , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` but the next time I argue it shall be , if possible , with power on my side , and , at all events , not quite so near a pond . ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 53]: `` I think , '' said Mrs Easy , who had been a silent listener , `` that Jack had better fish in the river , and then , if he catches no fish , at all events he will not be soused in the water , and spoil his clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 7]: But Mrs Easy was no philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 56]: A few days afterwards , Jack discovered , one fine morning , on the other side of a hedge , a summer apple-tree bearing tempting fruit , and he immediately broke through the hedge , and climbing the tree , as our first mother did before him , he culled the fairest and did eat .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 14]: `` I say , you sir , what are you doing there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 5]: cried a rough voice .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 22]: Jack looked down , and perceived a stout , thickset personage in grey coat and red waistcoat , standing underneath him .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 29]: `` Do n't you see what I 'm about , '' replied Jack , `` I 'm eating apples -- shall I throw you down a few ? ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 43]: `` Thank you kindly -- the fewer that are pulled the better ; perhaps , as you are so free to give them to others as well as to help yourself , you may think that they are your own property ! ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 17]: `` Not a bit more my property than they are yours , my good man . ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 78]: `` I guess that 's something like the truth ; but you are , not quite at the truth yet , my lad ; those apples are mine , and I 'll trouble you to come down as fast as you please ; when you 're down we can then settle our accounts ; and , '' continued the man , shaking his cudgel , `` depend upon it you shall have your receipt in full . ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 10]: Jack did not much like the appearance of things .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 49]: `` My good man , '' said he , `` it is quite a prejudice on your part to imagine that apples were not given , as well as all other fruit , for the benefit of us all -- they are common property , believe me . ''
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 21]: `` That 's a matter of opinion , my lad , and I may be allowed to have own . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 13]: `` You 'll find it in the Bible , '' says Jack .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 21]: `` I never did yet , and I 've read it through and through all , bating the Pocryfar . ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 24]: `` Then , '' said Jack , `` go home and fetch the Bible , and I 'll prove it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 13]: `` I suspect you 'll not wait till I come back again .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 67]: No , no ; I have lost plenty of apples , and have long wanted to find the robbers out ; now I 've caught one I 'll take care that he do n't ` scape without apple sauce , at all events -- so come down , you young thief , come down directly -- or it will be all the worse for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 16]: `` Thank you , '' said Jack , `` but I am very well here .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 16]: I will , if you please , argue the point from where I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 29]: `` I 've no time to argue the point , my lad ; I 've plenty to do , but do not think I 'll let you off .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 37]: If you do n't choose to come down , why then you may stay there , and I 'll answer for it , as soon as work is done I shall find you safe enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 21]: `` What can be done , '' thought Jack , `` with a man who will not listen to argument ?
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 6]: What a world is this !
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 20]: -- however , he 'll not find me here when he comes back , I 've a notion . ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 7]: But in this Jack was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 23]: The farmer walked to the hedge , and called to a boy , who took his orders and ran to the farmhouse .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 18]: In a minute or two a large bull-dog was seen bounding along the orchard to his master .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 19]: `` Mark him , Caesar , '' said the farmer to the dog , `` mark him . ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 35]: The dog crouched down on the grass with his head up , and eyes glaring at Jack , showing a range of teeth that drove all our hero 's philosophy out of his head .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 72]: `` I ca n't wait here , but Caesar can , and I will tell you , as a friend , that if he gets hold of you , he 'll not leave a limb of you together , -- when work 's done I 'll come back '' ; so saying , the farmer walked off , leaving Jack and the dog to argue the point , if so inclined .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 16]: What a sad jade must philosophy be , to put her votaries in such predicaments !
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 52]: After a while the dog laid his head down and closed his eyes , as if asleep , but Jack observed that at the least movement on his part one eye was seen partially to unclose ; so Jack , like a prudent man , resolved to remain where he was .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 20]: He picked a few more apples , for it was his dinner-time , and as he chewed he ruminated .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 69]: Jack had been but a few minutes ruminating before he was interrupted by another ruminating animal , no less a personage than a bull , who had been turned out with full possession of the orchard , and who now advanced , bellowing occasionally , and tossing his head at the sight of Caesar , whom he considered as much a trespasser as his master had our hero .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 22]: Caesar started on his legs and faced the bull , who advanced pawing , with his tail up in the air .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 41]: When within a few yards the bull made a rush at the dog , who evaded him and attacked him in return , and thus did the warfare continue until the opponents were already at some distance from the apple-tree .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 26]: Jack prepared for immediate flight , but unfortunately the combat was carried on by the side of the hedge at which Jack had gained admission .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 33]: Never mind , thought Jack , there are two sides to every field and although the other hedge joined on to the garden near to the farmhouse , there was no option .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 16]: `` At all events , '' said Jack , `` I 'll try it . ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 58]: Jack was slipping down the trunk , when he heard a tremendous roar ; the bull-dog had been tossed by the bull ; he was then high in the air , and Jack saw him fall on the other side of the hedge ; and the bull was thus celebrating his victory with a flourish of trumpets .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 26]: Upon which Jack , perceiving that he was relieved from his sentry , slipped down the rest of the tree and took to his heels .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 27]: Unfortunately for Jack , the bull saw him , and , flushed with victory , he immediately set up another roar , and bounded after Jack .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 43]: Jack perceived his danger , and fear gave him wings ; he not only flew over the orchard , but he flew over the hedge , which was about five feet high , just as the bull drove his head into it .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 10]: Look before you leap , is an old proverb .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 93]: Had Jack done so , he would have done better ; but as there were cogent reasons to be offered in extenuation of our philosopher , we shall say no more , but merely state that Jack , when he got to the other side of the hedge , found that he had pitched into a small apiary , and had upset two hives of bees who resented the intrusion ; and Jack had hardly time to get upon his legs before he found them very busy stinging him in all quarters .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 41]: All that Jack could do was to run for it , but the bees flew faster than he could run , and Jack was mad with pain , when he stumbled , half-blinded , over the brickwork of a well .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 24]: Jack could not stop his pitching into the well , but he seized the iron chain as it struck him across the face .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 78]: Down went Jack , and round went the windlass , and after a rapid descent of forty feet our hero found himself under water , and no longer troubled with the bees , who , whether they had lost scent of their prey from his rapid descent , or being notoriously clever insects , acknowledged the truth of the adage , `` leave well alone , '' had certainly left Jack with no other companion than Truth .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 44]: Jack rose from his immersion , and seized the rope to which the chain of the bucket was made fast -- it had all of it been unwound from the windlass , and therefore it enabled Jack to keep his head above water .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 66]: After a few seconds Jack felt something against his legs , it was the bucket , about two feet under the water ; Jack put his feet into it and found himself pretty comfortable , for the water , after the sting of the bees and the heat he had been put into by the race with the bull , was quite cool and refreshing .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 92]: `` At all events , '' thought Jack , `` if it had not been for the bull , I should have been watched by the dog , and then thrashed by the farmer ; but then again , if it had not been for the bull , I should not have tumbled among the bees ; and if it had not been for the bees , I should not have tumbled into the well ; and if it had not been for the chain , I should have been drowned .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 17]: Such has been the chain of events , all because I wanted to eat an apple .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 43]: `` However , I have got rid of the farmer , and the dog , and the bull , and the bees -- all 's well that ends well ; but how the devil am I to get out of the well ?
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 13]: -- all creation appears to have conspired against the rights of man .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 22]: As my father said , this is an iron age , and here I am swinging to an iron chain . ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 65]: We have given the whole of Jack 's soliloquy , as it will prove that Jack was no fool , although he was a bit of a philosopher ; and a man who could reason so well upon cause ant effect , at the bottom of a well , up to his neck in water , showed a good deal of presence of mind .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 30]: But if Jack 's mind had been a little twisted by his father 's philosophy , it had still sufficient strength and elasticity to recover itself in due time .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 18]: Had Jack been a common personage , we should never , have selected him for our hero .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 19]: CHAPTER VII In which Jack makes some very sage reflections , and comes to a very unwise decision .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 41]: After all , it must be acknowledged that although there are cases of distress in which a well may become a place of refuge , a well is not at all calculated for a prolonged residence -- so thought Jack .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 63]: After he had been there some fifteen minutes , his teeth chattered , and his limbs trembled ; he felt a numbness all over , and he thought it high time to call for assistance , which at first he would not , as he was afraid he should be pulled up to encounter the indignation of the farmer and his family .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 25]: Jack was arranging his jaws for a halloo , when he felt the chain pulled up , and he slowly emerged from the water .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 38]: At first he heard complaints of the weight of the bucket , at which Jack was not surprised ; then he heard a tittering and laughing between two parties ; and soon afterwards he mounted up gaily .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 38]: At last his head appeared above the low wall , and he was about to extend his arms so as to secure a position on it , when those who were working at the windlass beheld him .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 10]: It was a heavy farming man and a maid-servant .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 8]: `` Thank you , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 77]: One never should be too quick in returning thanks ; the girl screamed and let go the winch , the man , frightened , did not hold it fast ; it slipped from his grasp , whirled round , struck him under the chin , and threw him over it headlong , and before the `` Thank you '' was fairly out of Jack 's lips , down he went again like lightning to the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 48]: Fortunately for Jack , he had not yet let go the chain , or he might have struck the sides and have been killed ; as it was , he was merely soused a second time , and in a minute or two regained his former position .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 43]: `` This is mighty pleasant , '' thought Jack , as he clapped his wet hat once more on his head ; `` at all events , they ca n't now plead ignorance , they must know that I 'm here . ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 50]: In the meantime the girl ran into the kitchen , threw herself down on a stool , from which she reeled off in a fit upon sundry heaps of dough waiting to be baked in the oven , which were laid to rise on the floor before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 13]: `` Mercy on me , what is the matter with Susan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 6]: exclaimed the farmer 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 26]: `` Here -- where 's Mary -- where 's John -- Deary me , if the bread wo n't all be turned to pancakes . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 46]: John soon followed , holding his under-jaw in his hand , looking very dismal and very frightened , for two reasons ; one , because he thought that his jaw was broken , and the other , because he thought he had seen the devil .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 11]: `` Mercy on us , what is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 7]: exclaimed the farmer 's wife again .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 8]: `` Mary , Mary , Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 34]: screamed she , beginning to be frightened herself , for with all her efforts she could not remove Susan from the bed of dough , where she lay senseless and heavy as lead .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 34]: Mary answered to her mistress 's loud appeal , and with her assistance they raised up Susan ; but as for the bread , there was no hopes of it ever rising again .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 14]: `` Why do n't you come here and help Susan , John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 3]: cried Mary .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 4]: `` Aw-yaw-aw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 32]: was all the reply of John , who had had enough quite of helping Susan , and who continued to hold his head , as it were , in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 10]: `` What 's the matter here , missus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 7]: exclaimed the farmer , coming in .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 7]: `` Highty-tighty , what ails Susan ?
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 6]: and what ails you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 8]: continued the farmer , turning to John .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 15]: `` Dang it , but everything seems to go wrong , this blessed day .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 80]: First , there be all the apples stolen -- then there be all the hives turned topsy-turvy in the garden -- then there be Caesar with his flank opened by the bull -- then there be the bull broken through the hedge and tumbled into the saw-pit -- and now I come to get more help to drag him out , I find one woman dead like , and John looks as if he had seen the devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 4]: `` Aw-yaw-aw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 9]: replied John , nodding his head very significantly .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 12]: `` One would think that the devil had broke loose to-day .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 6]: What is it , John ?
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 12]: Have you seen him , and has Susan seen him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 4]: `` Aw-yaw . ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 30]: `` He 's stopped your jaw , then , at all events , and I thought the devil himself would n't have done that-we shall get nothing of you .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 9]: Is that wench coming to her senses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 19]: `` Yes , yes , she 's better now , -- Susan , what 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 7]: `` Oh , oh , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 11]: the well , the well -- '' `` The well !
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 16]: Something wrong there , I suppose : well , I will go and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 35]: The farmer trotted off to the well ; he perceived the bucket was at the bottom and all the rope out ; he looked about him , and then he looked into the well .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 64]: Jack , who had become very impatient , had been looking up some time for the assistance which he expected would have come sooner ; the round face of the farmer occasioned a partial eclipse of the round disk which bounded his view , just as one of the satellites of Jupiter sometimes obscures the face of the planet round which he revolves .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 50]: `` Here I am , '' cried Jack ; `` get me up quick , or I shall be dead '' ; and What Jack said was true , for he was quite done up by having been so long down , although his courage had not failed him .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 26]: `` Dang it , but there be somebody fallen into the well , '' cried the farmer ; `` no end to mishaps this day .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 31]: Well , we must get a Christian out of a well afore we get a bull out of a saw-pit , so I 'll go and call the men . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 19]: In a very short time the men who were assembled round the saw-pit were brought to the well .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 10]: `` Down below there , hold on now . ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 8]: `` Never fear , '' cried Jack .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 16]: Away went the winch , and once more Jack had an extended horizon to survey .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 32]: As soon as he was at the top , the men hauled him over the bricks and laid him down upon the ground , for Jack 's strength had failed him .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 55]: `` Dang it , if it bea n't that chap who was on my apple-tree , '' cried the farmer -- `` howsoever , he must not die for stealing a few apples ; lift him up , lads , and take him in -- he is dead with cold -- no wonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 42]: The farmer led the way , and the men carried Jack into the house , when the farmer gave him a glass of brandy ; this restored Jack 's circulation , and in a short time he was all right again .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 22]: After some previous conversation , in which Jack narrated all that had happened , `` What may be your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 4]: inquired the farmer .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 10]: `` My name is Easy , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 13]: be you the son of Mr Easy , of Forest Hill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 30]: `` Dang it , he be my landlord , and a right good landlord too -- why did n't you say so when you were up in the apple-tree ?
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 11]: You might have picked the whole orchard and welcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 50]: `` My dear sir , '' replied Jack , who had taken a second glass of brandy , and was quite talkative again , `` let this be a warning to you , and when a man proposes to argue the point , always , in future , listen .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 43]: Had you waited , I would have proved to you most incontestably that you had no more right to the apples than I had ; but you would not listen to argument , and without discussion we can never arrive at truth .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 53]: You send for your dog , who is ripped up by the bull -- the bull breaks his leg in a saw-pit -- the bee-hives are overturned , and you lose all your honey -- your man John breaks his jaw -- your maid Susan spoils all the bread -- and why ?
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 12]: because you would not allow me to argue the point . ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 153]: `` Well , Mr Easy , it be all true that all these mishaps have happened because I would not allow you to argue the point , perhaps , although , as I rent the orchard from your father , I can not imagine how you could prove to me that the apples were not mine ; but now , let 's take your side of the question , and I do n't see how you be much better off : you get up in a tree for a few apples , with plenty of money to buy them if you like -- you are kept there by a dog -- you are nearly gored by a bull -- you are stung by the bees , and you tumble souse into a well , and are nearly killed a dozen times , and all for a few apples not worth twopence . ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 32]: `` All very true , my good man , '' replied Jack ; `` but you forget that I , as a philosopher , was defending the rights of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 51]: `` Well , I never knew before that a lad who stole apples was called a philosopher -- we calls it petty larceny in the indictments : and as for your rights of man , I can not see how they can be defended by doing what 's wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 11]: `` You do not comprehend the matter , farmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 18]: `` No , I do n't -- and I be too old to learn , Master Easy .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 81]: All I have to say is this , you are welcome to all the apples in the orchard if you please , and if you prefers , as it seems you do , to steal them , instead of asking for them , which I only can account for by the reason that they say , that ` stolen fruit be sweetest , ' I 've only to say that I shall give orders that you be not interfered with .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 43]: My chaise be at the door , Master Easy , and the man will drive you to your father 's -- make my compliments to him , and say , that I 'm very sorry that you tumbled into our well . ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 25]: As Jack was much more inclined for bed than argument , he wished the farmer good-night , and allowed himself to be driven home .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 39]: The pain from the sting of the bees , now that his circulation had fully returned , was so great , that he was not sorry to find Dr Middleton taking his tea with his father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 21]: Jack merely said that he had been so unfortunate as to upset a hive , and had been severely stung .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 9]: He deferred the whole story till another opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 36]: Dr Middleton prescribed for Jack , but on taking his hand found that he was in a high fever , which , after the events of the day , was not to be wondered at .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 39]: Jack was bled , and kept his bed for a week , by which time he was restored ; but , during that time , Jack had been thinking very seriously , and had made up his mind .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 20]: But we must explain a circumstance which had occurred , which was probably the cause of Jack 's decision .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 73]: When Jack returned on the evening in question , he found seated with his father and Dr Middleton a Captain Wilson , a sort of cousin to the family , who but occasionally paid them a visit , for he lived at some distance ; and having a wife and large family , with nothing but his half-pay for their support , he could not afford to expend even shoe-leather in compliments .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 60]: The object of this visit on the part of Captain Wilson was to request the aid of Mr Easy He had succeeded in obtaining his appointment to a sloop of war -LRB- for he was in the king 's service -RRB- , but was without the means of fitting himself out , without leaving his wife and family penniless .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 29]: He therefore came to request Mr Easy to lend him a few hundred pounds , until he should be able , by his prize-money , to repay them .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 51]: Mr Easy was not a man to refuse such a request , and always having plenty of spare cash at his banker 's , he drew a cheque for a thousand pounds , which he gave to Captain Wilson , requesting that he would only repay it at his convenience .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 58]: Captain Wilson wrote an acknowledgment of the debt , promising to pay upon his first prize-money , which receipt , however binding it may be to a man of honour , was , in point of law , about as valuable as if he had agreed to pay as soon `` as the cows came home . ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 26]: The affair had been just concluded , and Captain Wilson had returned into the parlour with Mr Easy , when Jack returned from his expedition .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 37]: Jack greeted Captain Wilson , whom he had long known ; but , as we before observed , he suffered so much pain , that he soon retired with Dr Middleton , and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 29]: During a week there is room for much reflection , even in a lad of fourteen , although at that age we are not much inclined to think .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 59]: But Jack was in bed ; his eyes were so swollen with the stings of the bees that he could neither read nor otherwise amuse himself ; and he preferred his own thoughts to the gabble of Sarah , who attended him ; so Jack thought , and the result of his cogitations we shall soon bring forward .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 18]: It was on the eighth day that Jack left his bed and came down into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 23]: He then detailed to his father the adventures which had taken place , which had obliged him to take to his bed .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 120]: `` You see , Jack , '' replied his father , `` it 's just what I told you : the world is so utterly demoralised by what is called social compact , and the phalanx supporting it , by contributing a portion of their unjust possessions for the security of the remainder , is so powerful , that any one who opposes it must expect to pass the life of a martyr ; but martyrs are always required previous to any truth , however sublime , being received , and , like Abraham , whom I have always considered as a great philosopher , I am willing to sacrifice my only son in so noble a cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 21]: `` That 's all very good on your part , father , but we must argue the point a little .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 50]: If you are as great a philosopher as Abraham , I am not quite so dutiful a son as Isaac , whose blind obedience , in my opinion , is very contrary to your rights of man : but the fact , in few words , is simply this .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 70]: In promulgating your philosophy , in the short space of two days , I have been robbed of the fish I caught , and my rod and line -- I have been soused into a fish-pond -- I have been frightened out of my wits by a bull-dog -- been nearly killed by a bull -- been stung to death by bees , and twice tumbled into a well .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 21]: Now , if all that happens in two days , what must I expect to suffer in a whole year ?
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 26]: It appears to be very unwise to attempt making further converts , for people on shore seem determined not to listen to reason or argument .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 32]: But it has occurred to me , that although the whole earth has been so nefariously divided among the few , that the waters at least are the property of all .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 26]: No man claims his share of the sea -- every one may there plough as he pleases , without being taken up for a trespasser .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 33]: Even war makes no difference ; every one may go on as he pleases , and if they meet , it is nothing but a neutral ground on which the parties contend .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 65]: It is , then , only upon the ocean that I am likely to find that equality and rights of man , which we are so anxious to establish on shore ; and therefore I have resolved not to go to school again , which I detest , but to go to sea , and propagate our opinions as much as I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 34]: `` I can not listen to that , Jack , in the first place , you must return to school ; in the next place , you shall not go to sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 36]: `` Then , father , all I have to say is , that I swear by the rights of man I will not go back to school , and that I will go to sea .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 8]: Who and what is to prevent me ?
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 8]: Was not I born my own master ?
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 18]: -- has any one a right to dictate to me as if I were not his equal ?
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 17]: Have I not as much right to my share of the sea as any other mortal ?
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 18]: I stand upon perfect equality , '' continued Jack , stamping his right foot on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 9]: What had Mr Easy to offer in reply ?
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 24]: He must either , as a philosopher , have sacrificed his hypothesis , or , as a father , have sacrificed his son .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 37]: Like all philosophers , he preferred what he considered as the less important of the two , he sacrificed his son ; but -- we will do him justice -- he did it with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 16]: `` Jack , you shall , if you wish it , go to sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 26]: `` That , of course , '' replied Jack , with the air of a conqueror ; `` but the question is , with whom ?
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 28]: Now it has occurred to me , that Captain Wilson has just been appointed to a ship , and I should like to sail with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 35]: `` I will write to him , '' said Mr Easy , mournfully , `` but I should have liked to have felt his head first '' ; and thus was the matter arranged .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 27]: The answer from Captain Wilson was , of course , in the affirmative , and he promised that he would treat Jack as his own son .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 15]: Our hero mounted his father 's horse , and rode off to Mr Bonnycastle .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 11]: `` I am going to sea , Mr Bonnycastle . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 13]: `` The very best thing for you , '' replied Mr Bonnycastle .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 6]: Our hero met Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 11]: `` I am going to sea , Dr Middleton . ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 13]: `` The very best thing for you , '' replied the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 13]: `` I am going to sea , mother , '' said John .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 9]: `` To sea , John , to sea ?
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 22]: no , no , dear John , you are not going to sea , '' replied Mrs Easy , with horror .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 19]: `` Yes , I am ; father has agreed , and says he will obtain your consent . ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 4]: `` My consent !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 9]: Oh , my dear , dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 14]: -- and Mrs Easy wept bitterly , as Rachel mourning for her children .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 19]: CHAPTER VIII In which Mr Easy has his first lesson as to zeal in his Majesty 's Service .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 32]: As there was no time to lose , our hero very soon bade adieu to his paternal roof , as the phrase is , and found his way down to Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 71]: As Jack had plenty of money , and was very much pleased at finding himself his own master , he was in no hurry to join his ship , and five or six companions , not very creditable , whom either Jack had picked up , or had picked up Jack , and who lived upon him , strongly advised him to put it off until the very last moment .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 77]: As this advice happened to coincide with Jack 's opinion , our hero was three weeks at Portsmouth before any one knew of his arrival , but at last Captain Wilson received a letter from Mr Easy , by which he found that Jack had left home at the period we have mentioned , and he desired the first lieutenant to make inquiries , as he was afraid that some accident might have happened to him .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 55]: As Mr Sawbridge , the first lieutenant , happened to be going on shore on the same evening for the last time previous to the ship 's sailing , he looked into the Blue Posts , George , and Fountain Inns , to inquire if there was such a person arrived as Mr Easy .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 24]: `` O yes , '' replied the waiter at the Fountain , -- `` Mr Easy has been here these three weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 36]: `` The devil he has , '' roared Mr Sawbridge , with all the indignation of a first lieutenant defrauded three weeks of a midshipman ; `` where is he ; in the coffee-room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 25]: `` Oh dear no , sir , '' replied the waiter , `` Mr Easy has the front apartments on the first floor . ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 14]: `` Well , then , show me up to the first floor . ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 13]: `` May I request the pleasure of your name , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 4]: said the waiter .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 27]: `` First lieutenants do n't send up their names to midshipmen , '' replied Mr Sawbridge ; `` he shall soon know who I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 20]: At this reply , the waiter walked upstairs , followed by Mr Sawbridge , and threw open the door .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 15]: `` A gentleman wishes to see you , sir , '' said the waiter .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 40]: `` Desire him to walk in , '' said Jack : `` and , waiter , mind that the punch is a little better than it was yesterday ; I have asked two more gentlemen to dine here . ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 78]: In the meantime , Mr Sawbridge , who was not in his uniform , had entered , and perceived Jack alone , with the dinner table laid out in the best style for eight , a considerable show of plate for even the Fountain Inn , and everything , as well as the apartment itself , according to Mr Sawbridge 's opinion , much more fit for a commander-in-chief than a midshipman of a sloop of war .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 40]: Now Mr Sawbridge was a good officer , one who had really worked his way up to the present rank , that is to say , that he had served seven-and-twenty years , and had nothing but his pay .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 51]: He was a little soured in the service , and certainly had an aversion to the young men of family who were now fast crowding into it -- and with some grounds , as he perceived his own chance of promotion decrease in the same ratio as the numbers increased .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 64]: He considered that in proportion as midshipmen assumed a cleaner and more gentlemanly appearance , so did they become more useless , and it may therefore be easily imagined that his bile was raised by this parade and display in a lad , who was very shortly to be , and ought three weeks before to have been , shrinking from his frown .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 25]: Nevertheless , Sawbridge was a good-hearted man , although a little envious of luxury , which he could not pretend to indulge in himself .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 35]: `` May I beg to ask , '' said Jack , who was always remarkably polite and gentlemanly in his address , `` in what manner I may be of service to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 14]: `` Yes , sir , you may -- by joining your ship immediately .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 27]: And may I beg to ask in return , sir , what is the reason you have stayed on shore three weeks without joining her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 58]: Hereupon Jack , who did not much admire the peremptory tone of Mr Sawbridge , and who during the answer had taken a seat , crossed his legs , and played with the gold chain to which his watch was secured , after a pause very coolly replied -- `` And pray , who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 8]: `` Who am I , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 27]: replied Sawbridge , jumping out of his chair , `` my name is Sawbridge , sir , and I am the first lieutenant of the Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 10]: Now , sir , you have your answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 34]: Mr Sawbridge , who imagined that the name of the first lieutenant would strike terror to a culprit midshipman , threw himself back in the chair , and assumed an air of importance .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 49]: `` Really , sir , '' replied Jack , `` what may be your exact situation on board , my ignorance of the service will not allow me to guess , but if I may judge from your behaviour , you have no small opinion of yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 45]: `` Look ye , young man , you may not know what a first lieutenant is , and I take it for granted that you do not , by your behaviour ; but depend upon it , I 'll let you know very soon .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 19]: In the meantime , sir , I insist upon it , that you go immediately on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 21]: `` I 'm sorry that I can not comply with your very moderate request , '' replied Jack , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 28]: `` I shall go on board when it suits my convenience , and I beg that you will give yourself no further trouble on my account . ''
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 53]: Jack then rang the bell ; the waiter , who had been listening outside , immediately entered , and before Mr Sawbridge , who was dumb with astonishment at Jack 's impertinence , could have time to reply -- `` Waiter , '' said Jack , `` show this gentleman downstairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 8]: `` By the god of war ! ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 47]: exclaimed the first lieutenant , `` but I 'll soon show you down to the boat , my young bantam ; and when once I get you safe on board , I 'll make you know the difference between a midshipman and a first lieutenant . ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 29]: `` I can only admit of equality , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` we are all born equal -- I trust you 'll allow that . ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 17]: `` Equality -- damn it , I suppose you 'll take the command of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 13]: However , sir , your ignorance will be a little enlightened by-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 49]: I shall now go and report your conduct to Captain Wilson ; and I tell you plainly , that if you are not on board this evening , to-morrow morning , at daylight , I shall send a sergeant and a file of marines to fetch you . ''
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 49]: `` You may depend upon it , sir , '' replied Jack , `` that I also shall not fail to mention to Captain Wilson , that I consider you a very quarrelsome , impertinent fellow , and recommend him not to allow you to remain on board .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 18]: It will be quite uncomfortable to be in the same ship with such an ungentlemanly bear . ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 20]: `` He must be mad -- quite mad , '' exclaimed Sawbridge , whose astonishment even mastered his indignation .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 11]: `` Mad as a march hare -- by God . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 22]: `` No , sir , '' replied Jack , `` I am not mad , but I am a philosopher . ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 5]: `` A what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 9]: exclaimed Sawbridge , `` damme , what next ?
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 22]: -- well , my joker , all the better for you , I shall put your philosophy to the proof . ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 58]: `` It is for that very reason , sir , '' replied Jack , `` that I have decided upon going to sea ; and if you do remain on board , I hope to argue the point with you , and make you a convert to the truth of equality and the rights of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 61]: `` By the Lord that made us both , I 'll soon make you a convert to the thirty-six articles of war -- that is , if you remain on board ; but I shall now go to the captain , and report your conduct , sir , and leave you to your dinner with what appetite you may . ''
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 57]: `` Sir , I am infinitely obliged to you ; but you need not be afraid of my appetite ; I am only sorry , as you happen to belong to the same ship , that I can not , in justice to the gentlemanly young men whom I expect , ask you to join them .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 11]: I wish you a very good morning , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 41]: `` Twenty years have I been in the service , '' roared Sawbridge , `` and damme -- but he 's mad -- downright , stark , staring mad , '' and the first lieutenant bounced out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 7]: Jack was a little astonished himself .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 73]: Had Mr Sawbridge made his appearance in uniform it might have been different ; but that a plain-looking man , with black whiskers , shaggy hair , and old blue frock coat and yellow cassimere waistcoat , should venture to address him in such a manner , was quite incomprehensible ; -- he calls me mad , thought Jack , I shall tell Captain Wilson what is my opinion about his lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 14]: Shortly afterwards the company arrived , and Jack soon forgot all about it .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 17]: In the meantime Sawbridge called at the captain 's lodgings , and found him at home .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 36]: He made a very faithful report of all that had happened , and concluded his report by demanding , in great wrath , either an instant dismissal or a court-martial on our hero , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 37]: `` Stop , Sawbridge , '' replied Captain Wilson , `` take a chair : as Mr Easy says , we must argue the point , and then I will leave it to your better feelings .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 61]: As for the court-martial , it will not hold good , for Mr Easy , in the first place , has not yet joined the ship , and in the next place , could not be supposed to know that you were the first lieutenant , or even an officer , for you went to him out of uniform . ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 17]: `` Very true , sir , '' replied Sawbridge , `` I had forgotten that . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 105]: `` Then , as for his dismissal , or rather , not allowing him to join , Mr Easy has been brought up in the country , and has never seen anything aquatic larger than a fish-pond , perhaps , in his life ; and as for the service , or the nature of it , I believe he is as ignorant of it as a child not a year old -- I doubt whether he knows the rank of a lieutenant , certainly , he can have no idea of the power of a first lieutenant , by his treatment of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 12]: `` I should think not , '' replied Sawbridge , dryly .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 31]: `` I do not think , therefore , that conduct which must have proceeded from sheer ignorance should be so severely punished -- I appeal to you , Sawbridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 29]: `` Well , sir , perhaps you are right -- but still he told me he was a philosopher , and talked about equality and rights of man .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 19]: Told me that he could only admit of equality between us , and begged to argue the point .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 30]: Now , sir , if a midshipman is to argue the point every time that an order is given , the service will come to a pretty pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 34]: `` That is all very true , Sawbridge ; and now you remind me of what never occurred to me at the time that I promised to take Mr Easy in the ship .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 39]: I now recollect that his father , who is a distant relation of mine , has some very wild notions in his head , just like what have been repeated by his son on your interview with him .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 45]: I have occasionally dined there , and Mr Easy has always been upholding the principles of natural equality and of the rights of man , much to the amusement of his guests , and I confess , at the time , of mine also .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 34]: I recollect telling him that I trusted he would never be able to disseminate his opinions in the service to which I belonged , as we should have an end of all discipline .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 66]: I little thought , at the time , that his only son , who has no more occasion to go to sea than the Archbishop of Canterbury , for his father has a very handsome property I believe seven or eight thousand a year -- would ever have sailed with me , and have brought these opinions with him into any ship that I commanded .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 10]: It is a pity , a great pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 17]: `` He never could have brought his pigs to a worse market , '' observed Sawbridge .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 37]: `` I agree with you , and , as a father myself , I can not but help feeling how careful we should be , how we inculcate anything like abstract and philosophical ideas to youth .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 66]: Allowing them to be in themselves correct , still they are dangerous as sharp instruments are in the hands of a child ; -- allowing them to be erroneous , they are seized upon with an avidity by young and ardent minds , and are not to be eradicated without the greatest difficulty , and very often not until they have accomplished their ruin . ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 30]: `` Then you think , sir , that these ideas have taken deep root in this young man , and we shall not easily rid him of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 61]: `` I do not say so ; but still , recollect they have been instilled , perhaps , from the earliest period , by one from whom they must have been received with all confidence -- from a father to a son ; and that son has never yet been sufficiently in the world to have proved their fallacy . ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 84]: `` Well , sir , '' replied Sawbridge , `` if I may venture to offer an opinion on the subject -- and in so doing I assure you that I only shall from a feeling for the service -- if , as you say , these opinions will not easily be Eradicated , as the young man is independent , would it not be both better for himself , as well as for the service , that he is sent home again ?
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 21]: As an officer he will never do any good for himself , and he may do much harm to others .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 55]: I submit this to you , Captain Wilson , with all respect ; but as your first lieutenant , I feel very jealous at any chance of the discipline of the ship being interfered with by the introduction of this young man , to whom it appears that a profession is no object . ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 74]: `` My dear Sawbridge , '' replied Captain Wilson , after taking one or two turns up and down the room , `` we entered the service together , we were messmates for many years , and you must be aware that it is not only long friendship , but an intimate knowledge of your unrewarded merit , which has induced me to request you to come with me as my first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 28]: Now , I will put a case to you , and you shall then decide the question -- and moreover , I will abide by your decision .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 42]: `` Suppose that you were a commander like myself , with a wife and seven children , and that , struggling for many years to support them , you found yourself , notwithstanding the utmost parsimony , gradually running into debt .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 52]: That , after many long applications , you had at last succeeded in obtaining employment by an appointment to a fine sloop , and there was every prospect , by prize-money and increased pay , of recovering yourself from your difficulties , if not realising a sufficient provision for your family .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 77]: Then suppose that all this prospect and all these hopes were likely to be dashed to the ground by the fact of having no means of fitting yourself out , no credit , no means of paying debts you have contracted , for which you would have been arrested , or anything sufficient to leave for the support of your family during your absence , your agent only consenting to advance one-half of what you require .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 148]: Now , suppose , in this awkward dilemma , without anyone in this world upon whom you have any legitimate claim , as a last resource you were to apply to one with whom you have but a distant connection , and but an occasional acquaintance -- and that when you had made your request for the loan of two or three hundred pounds , fully anticipating a refusal -LRB- from the feeling that he who goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing -RRB- , -- I say , suppose , to your astonishment , that this generous person was to present you with a cheque on his banker for one thousand pounds , demanding no interest , no legal security , and requests you only to pay it at your convenience , -- I ask you , Sawbridge , what would be your feelings towards such a man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 14]: `` I would die for him , '' replied Sawbridge , with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 32]: `` And suppose that , by the merest chance , or from a whim of the moment , the son of that man was to be placed under your protection ? ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 13]: `` I would be a father to him , '' replied Sawbridge .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 86]: `` But we must proceed a little further : suppose that you were to find the lad was not all that you could wish -- that he had imbibed erroneous doctrines , which would probably , if not eradicated , be attended with consequences fatal to his welfare and happiness , would you therefore , on that account , withdraw your protection , and leave him to the mercy of others , who had no claims of gratitude to sway them in his favour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 60]: `` Most certainly not , sir , '' replied Sawbridge ; `` on the contrary , I would never part with the son until , by precept or otherwise , I had set him right again , and thus had , as far as it was possible , paid the debt of gratitude due to the generous father . ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 40]: `` I hardly need say to you , Sawbridge , after what has passed , that this lad you have just come from , is the son , and that Mr Easy of Forest Hill is the father . ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 68]: `` Then , sir , I can only say , that not only to please you , but also from respect to a man who has shown such good-will towards one of our cloth , I shall most cheerfully forgive all that has passed between the lad and me , and all that may probably take place before we make him what he ought to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 22]: `` Thank you , Sawbridge ; I expected as much , and am not disappointed in my opinion of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 15]: `` And now , Captain Wilson , pray what is to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 25]: `` We must get him on board , but not with a file of marines , -- that will do more harm than good .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 23]: I will send a note , requesting him to breakfast with me to-morrow morning , and have a little conversation with him .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 31]: I do not wish to frighten him ; he would not scruple to run back to Forest Hill -- now I wish to keep him if I possibly can . ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 14]: `` You are right , sir ; his father appears his greatest enemy .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 19]: What a pity that a man with so good a heart should be so weak in the head !
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 24]: Then , sir , I shall take no notice of this at present , but leave the whole affair in your hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 19]: `` Do , Sawbridge ; you have obliged me very much by your kindness in this business . ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 32]: Mr Sawbridge then took his leave , and Captain Wilson despatched a note to our hero , requesting the pleasure of his company to breakfast at nine o'clock the ensuing morning .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 24]: The answer was in the affirmative , but verbal , for Jack had drunk too much champagne to trust his pen to paper .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 18]: CHAPTER IX In which Mr Easy finds himself on the other side of the Bay of Biscay .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 56]: The next morning Jack Easy would have forgotten all about his engagement with the captain , had it not been for the waiter , who thought that , after the reception which our hero had given the first lieutenant , it would be just as well that he should not be disrespectful to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 33]: Now Jack had not , hitherto , put on his uniform , and he thought this a fitting occasion , particularly as the waiter suggested the propriety of his appearance in it .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 32]: Whether it was from a presentiment of what he was to suffer , Jack was not at all pleased , as most lads are , with the change in his dress .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 54]: It appeared to him that he was sacrificing his independence ; however , he did not follow his first impulse , which was to take it off again , but took his hat , which the waiter had brushed and handed to him , and then set off for the captain 's lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 43]: Captain Wilson received him as if he had not been aware of his delay in joining his ship , or his interview with his first lieutenant , but before breakfast was over , Jack himself narrated the affair in a few words .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 129]: Captain Wilson then entered into a detail of the duties and rank of every person on board of the ship , pointing out to Jack , that where discipline was required , it was impossible , when duty was carried on , that more than one could command ; and that that one was the captain , who represented the king in person , who represented the country ; and that , as the orders were transmitted from the captain through the lieutenant , and from the lieutenant to the midshipmen , who , in their turn , communicated them to the whole ship 's company , in fact , it was the captain alone who gave the orders , and that everyone was equally obliged to obey .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 34]: Indeed , as the captain himself had to obey the orders of his superiors , the Admiral and the Admiralty ; all on board might be said to be equally obliged to obey .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 144]: Captain Wilson laid a strong emphasis on the word equally , as he cautiously administered his first dose ; indeed , in the whole of his address , he made use of special pleading , which would have done credit to the bar ; for at the same time that he was explaining to Jack that he was entering a service in which equality could never for a moment exist , if the service was to exist , he contrived to show that all the grades were levelled , by all being equally bound to do their duty to their country , and that , in fact , whether a seaman obeyed his orders , or he obeyed the orders of his superior officer , they were in reality only obeying the orders of the country , which were administered through their channels .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 24]: Jack did not altogether dislike this view of the subject , and the captain took care not to dwell too long upon it .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 18]: He then entered upon other details , which he was aware would be more agreeable to Jack .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 143]: He pointed out that the articles of war were the rules by which the service was to be guided , and that everybody , from the captain to the least boy in the ship , was equally bound to adhere to them that a certain allowance of provisions and wine were allowed to each person on board , and that this allowance was the same to all ; the same to the captain as to the boy ; the same in quantity as in quality ; everyone equally entitled to his allowance ; -- that , although there were , of necessity , various grades necessary in the service , and the captain 's orders were obliged to be passed and obeyed by all , yet still , whatever was the grade of the officer , they were equally considered as gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 75]: In short , Captain Wilson , who told the truth , and nothing but the truth , Without telling the whole truth , actually made Jack fancy that he had at last found out that equality he had been seeking for in vain on shore , when , at last , he recollected the language used by Mr Sawbridge the evening before , and asked the captain why that personage had so conducted himself .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 24]: Now , as the language of Mr Sawbridge was very much at variance with equality , Captain Wilson was not a little puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 60]: However , he first pointed out that the first lieutenant was , at the time being , the captain , as he was the senior officer on board , as would Jack himself be if he were the senior officer on board ; and that , as he before observed , the captain or senior officer represented the country .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 117]: That in the articles of war , everybody who absented himself from the ship , committed an error , or breach of those articles ; and if any error or breach of those articles was committed by anyone belonging to the ship , if the senior officer did not take notice of it , he then himself committed a breach of those articles , and was liable himself to be punished , if he could not prove that he had noticed it ; it was therefore to save himself that he was obliged to point out the error ; and if he did it in strong language , it only proved his zeal for his country .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 43]: `` Upon my honour , then , '' replied Jack , `` there can be no doubt of his zeal ; for if the whole country had been at stake , he could not have put himself in a greater passion . ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 48]: `` Then he did his duty ; but depend upon it it was not a pleasant one to him : and I 'll answer for it , when you meet him on board , he will be as friendly with you as if nothing had happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 25]: `` He told me that he 'd soon make me know what a first lieutenant was : what did he mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 3]: inquired Jack .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 5]: `` All zeal . ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 31]: `` Yes , but he said , that as soon as he got on board , he 'd show me the difference between a first lieutenant and a midshipman . ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 5]: `` All zeal . ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 13]: `` He said my ignorance should be a little enlightened by-and-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 5]: `` All zeal . ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 15]: `` And that he 'd send a sergeant and marines to fetch me . ''
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 5]: `` All zeal . ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 12]: `` That he would put my philosophy to the proof . ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 7]: `` All zeal , Mr Easy .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 19]: Zeal will break out in this way ; but we should do nothing in the service without it .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 17]: Recollect that I hope and trust one day to see you also a zealous officer . ''
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 10]: Here Jack cogitated considerably , and gave no answer .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 24]: `` You will , I am sure , '' continued Captain Wilson , `` find Mr Sawbridge one of your best friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 20]: `` Perhaps so , '' replied Jack , `` but I did not much admire our first acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 28]: `` It will perhaps be your unpleasant duty to find as much fault yourself ; we are all equally bound to do our duty to our country .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 40]: But , Mr Easy , I sent for you to say that we shall sail to-morrow ; and , as I shall send my things off this afternoon by the launch , you had better send yours off also .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 20]: At eight o'clock I shall go on board , and we can both go in the same boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 47]: To this Jack made no sort of objection , and having paid his bill at the Fountain , he sent his chest down to the boat by some of the crew who came up for it , and attended the summons of the captain to embark .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 19]: By nine o'clock that evening , Mr Jack Easy was safe on board his Majesty 's sloop Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 21]: When Jack arrived on board , it was dark , and he did not know what to do with himself .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 19]: The captain was received by the officers on deck , who took off their hats to salute him .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 36]: The captain returned the salute , and so did Jack very politely , after which , the captain entered into conversation with the first lieutenant , and for a while Jack was left to himself .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 75]: It was too dark to distinguish faces , and to one who had never been on board of a ship , too dark to move , so Jack stood where he was , which was not far from the main bitts ; but he did not stay long ; the boat had been hooked on to the quarter davits , and the boatswain had called out -- `` Set taut , my lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 14]: And then with the shrill whistle , and `` Away with her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 71]: forward came galloping and bounding along , the men with the tackles ; and in the dark Jack was upset , and half a dozen marines fell upon him ; the men , who had no idea that an officer was floored among the others , were pleased at the joke , and continued to dance over those who were down , until they rolled themselves out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 85]: Jack , who did not understand this , fared badly , and it was not till the calls piped belay that he could recover his legs , after having been trampled upon by half the starboard watch , and the breath completely jammed out of his body , Jack reeled to a carronade slide , when the officers who had been laughing at the lark as well as the men , perceived his situation -- among others , Mr Sawbridge , the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 9]: `` Are you hurt , Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 5]: said he , kindly .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 12]: `` A little , '' replied Jack , catching his breath .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 38]: `` You 've had but a rough welcome , '' replied the first lieutenant , `` but at certain times , on board ship , it is every man for himself , and God for us all .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 34]: Harpur , '' continued the first lieutenant to the doctor , `` take Mr Easy down in the gun-room with you , and I will be down myself as soon as I can .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 6]: Where is Mr Jolliffe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 21]: `` Here , sir , '' replied Mr Jolliffe , a master 's mate , coming aft from the booms .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 12]: `` There is a youngster come on board with the captain .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 12]: Order one of the quarter-masters to get a hammock slung . ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 19]: In the meantime Jack went down into the gun-room , where a glass of wine somewhat recovered him .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 15]: He did not stay there long , nor did he venture to talk much .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 34]: As soon as his hammock was ready , Jack was glad to go to bed -- and as he was much bruised he was not disturbed the next morning till past nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 80]: He then dressed himself , went on deck , found that the sloop was just clear of the Needles , that he felt very queer , then very sick , and was conducted by a marine down below , put into his hammock , where he remained during a gale of wind of three days , bewildered , confused , puzzled , and every minute knocking his head against the beams with the pitching and tossing of the sloop .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 63]: `` And this is going to sea , '' thought Jack ; `` no wonder that no one interferes with another here , or talks about a trespass ; for I 'm sure anyone is welcome to my share of the ocean ; and if I once get on shore again , the devil may have my portion if he chooses . ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 19]: Captain Wilson and Mr Sawbridge had both allowed Jack more leisure than most midshipmen , during his illness .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 16]: By the time that the gale was over , the sloop was off Cape Finisterre .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 20]: The next morning the sea was nearly down , and there was but a slight breeze on the waters .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 59]: The comparative quiet of the night before had very much recovered our hero , and when the hammocks were piped up , he was accosted by Mr Jolliffe , the master 's mate , who asked , `` whether he intended to rouse and bit , or whether he intended to sail to Gibraltar between his blankets . ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 18]: Jack , who felt himself quite another person , turned out of his hammock and dressed himself .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 45]: A marine had , by the captain 's orders , attended Jack during his illness , and this man came to his assistance , opened his chest , and brought him all he required , or Jack would have been in a sad dilemma .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 26]: Jack then inquired where he was to go , for he had not been in the midshipmen 's berth , although five days on board .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 42]: The marine pointed it out to him , and Jack , who felt excessively hungry , crawled over and between chests , until he found himself fairly in a hole infinitely inferior to the dog-kennels which received his father 's pointers .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 35]: `` I 'd not only give up the ocean , '' thought Jack , `` and my share of it , but also my share of the Harpy , unto anyone who fancies it .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 4]: Equality enough here !
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 8]: for everyone appears equally miserably off . ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 44]: As he thus gave vent to his thoughts , he perceived that there was another person in the berth -- Mr Jolliffe , the master 's mate , who had fixed his eye upon Jack , and to whom Jack returned the compliment .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 55]: The first thing that Jack observed was , that Mr Jolliffe was very deeply pockmarked , and that he had but one eye , and that was a piercer ; it appeared like a little ball of fire , and as if it reflected more light from the solitary candle than the candle gave .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 20]: `` I do n't like your looks , '' thought Jack -- `` we shall never be friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 19]: But here Jack fell into the common error of judging by appearances , as will be proved hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 48]: `` I 'm glad to see you up again , youngster , '' said Jolliffe ; `` you 've been on your beam ends longer than usual , but those who are strongest suffer most -- you made your mind up but late to come to sea .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 13]: However , they say , ` better late than never ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 27]: `` I feel very much inclined to argue the truth of that saying , '' replied Jack ; `` but it 's no use just now .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 13]: I 'm terribly hungry -- when shall I get some breakfast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 12]: `` To-morrow morning at half-past eight , '' replied Mr Jolliffe .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 12]: `` Breakfast for to-day has been over these two hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 9]: `` But must I then go without ? ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 26]: `` No , I do not say that , as we must make allowances for your illness ; but it will not be breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 24]: `` Call it what you please , '' replied Jack , `` only pray desire the servants to give me something to eat .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 16]: Dry toast or muffins -- anything will do , but I should prefer coffee . ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 64]: `` You forget that you are off Finisterre , in a midshipman 's berth : coffee we have none -- muffins we never see , dry toast can not be made , as we have no soft bread ; but a cup of tea , and ship 's biscuit and butter , I can desire the steward to get ready for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 19]: `` Well then , '' replied Jack , `` I will thank you to procure me that . ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 12]: `` Marine , '' cried Jolliffe , `` call Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 28]: `` Pass the word for Mesty , '' cried the marine -- and the two syllables were handed forward until lost in the forepart of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 11]: The person so named must be introduced to the reader .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 23]: He was a curious anomaly -- a black man who had been brought to America as a slave , and there sold .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 24]: He was a very tall , spare-built , yet muscular form , and had a face by no means common with his race .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 64]: His head was long and narrow , high cheek-bones , from whence his face descended down to almost a point at the chin ; his nose was very small , but it was straight and almost Roman ; his mouth also was unusually small ; and his lips thin for an African ; his teeth very white , and filed to sharp points .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 21]: He claimed the rank of prince in his own country , with what truth could not of course be substantiated .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 57]: His master had settled at New York , and there Mesty had learned English , if it could be so-called : the fact is , that all the emigrant labourers at New York being Irishmen , he had learned English with the strong brogue and peculiar phraseology of the sister kingdom dashed with a little Yankeeism .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 25]: Having been told that there was no slavery in England , Mesty had concealed himself on board an English merchant vessel , and escaped .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 14]: On his arrival in England he had entered on board of a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 57]: Having no name , it was necessary to christen him on the ship 's books , and the first lieutenant , who had entered him , struck with his remarkable expression of countenance , and being a German scholar , had named him Mephistopheles Faust , from whence his Christian name had been razed to Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 79]: Mesty in other points was an eccentric character ; at one moment , when he remembered his lineage , he was proud to excess , at others he was grave and almost sullen -- but when nothing either in daily occurrences or in his mind ran contrary , he exhibited the drollery so often found in his nation , with a spice of Irish humour , as if he had caught up the latter with his Irish brogue .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 26]: Mesty was soon seen coming aft , but almost double as he couched under the beams , and taking large strides with his naked feet .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 60]: `` By the powers , Massa Yolliffe , but it is not seasonable at all to send for me just now , anyhow , seeing how the praters are in the copper , and so many blackguard ` palpeens all ready to change net for net , and better themselves by the same mistake , ` dam um . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 57]: `` Mesty , you know I never send for you myself , or allow others to do so , unless it is necessary , '' replied Jolliffe ; `` but this poor lad has eaten nothing since he has been on board , and is very hungry -- you must get him a little tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 9]: `` Is it tay you mane , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 71]: -- I guess , to make tay , in the first place I must ab water , and in the next must ab room in the galley to put the kettle on -- and ` pose you wanted to burn the tip of your little finger just now , it 's not in the galley that you find a berth for it -- and den the water before seven bells .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 10]: I 've a notion it 's just impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 10]: `` But he must have something , Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 20]: `` Never mind the tea , then , '' replied Jack , `` I 'll take some milk . ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 20]: `` Is it milk massa manes , and the bumboat woman on the oder side of the bay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 37]: `` We have no milk , Mr Easy ; you forget that we are on blue water , '' replied Jolliffe , `` and I really am afraid that you 'll have to wait till dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 6]: Mesty tells the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 39]: `` I tell you what , Massa Yolliffe , it just seven bells , and if the young gentleman would , instead of tay , try a little out of the copper , it might keep him asy .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 12]: It but a little difference , tay soup and pay soup .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 23]: Now a bowl of that , with some nuts and a flourish of pepper , will do him good , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 20]: `` Perhaps the best thing he can take , Mesty ; get it as fast as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 40]: In a few minutes the black brought down a bowl of soup and whole peas swimming in it , put before our hero a tin bread-basket full of small biscuit , called midshipmen 's nuts , and the pepper-caster .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 53]: Jack 's visions of tea , coffee , muffins , dry toast , and milk , vanished as he perceived the mess ; but he was very hungry , and he found it much better than he expected ; and he moreover found himself much the better after he had swallowed it .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 13]: It struck seven bells , and he accompanied Mr Jolliffe on deck .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 11]: CHAPTER X Showing how Jack transgresses against his own philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 93]: When Jack Easy had gained the deck , he found the sun shining gaily , a soft air blowing from the shore , and the whole of the rigging and every part of the ship loaded with the shirts , trousers , and jackets of the seamen , which had been wetted during the heavy gale , and were now hanging up to dry ; all the wet sails were also spread on the booms or triced up in the rigging , and the ship was slowly forging through the blue water .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 31]: The captain and first lieutenant were standing on the gangway in converse , and the majority of the officers were with their quadrants and sextants ascertaining the latitude at noon .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 26]: The decks were white and clean , the sweepers had just laid by their brooms , and the men were busy coiling down the ropes .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 36]: It was a scene of cheerfulness , activity , and order , which tightened his heart after the four days of suffering , close air , and confinement , from which he had just emerged .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 44]: The captain , who perceived him , beckoned to him , asked him kindly how he felt : the first lieutenant also smiled upon him , and many of the officers , as well as his messmates , congratulated him upon his recovery .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 26]: The captain 's steward came up to him , touched his hat , and requested the pleasure of his company to dinner in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 17]: Jack was the essence of politeness , took off his hat , and accepted the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 32]: Jack was standing on a rope which a seaman was coiling down ; the man touched his hat and requested he would be so kind as to take his foot off .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 17]: Jack took his hat off his head in return , and his foot off the rope .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 46]: The master touched his hat , and reported twelve o'clock to the first lieutenant -- the first lieutenant touched his hat , and reported twelve o'clock to the captain -- the captain touched his hat , and told the first lieutenant to make it so .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 35]: The officer of the watch touched his hat , and asked the captain whether they should pipe to dinner -- the captain touched his hat , and said -- `` If you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 33]: The midshipman received his orders , and touched his hat , which he gave to the head boatswain 's mate , who touched his hat , and then the calls whistled cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 29]: `` Well , '' thought Jack , `` politeness seems to be the order of the day , and everyone has an equal respect for the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 105]: Jack stayed on deck ; he peeped through the ports , which were open , and looked down into the deep blue wave ; he cast his eyes aloft , and watched the tall spars sweeping and tracing with their points , as it were , a small portion of the clear sky , as they acted in obedience to the motion of the vessel ; he looked forward at the range of carronades which lined the sides of the deck , and then he proceeded to climb one of the carronades , and lean over the hammocks to gaze on the distant land .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 26]: `` Young gentleman , get off those hammocks , '' cried the master , who was officer of the watch , in a surly tone .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 4]: Jack looked round .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 8]: `` Do you hear me , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 12]: I 'm speaking to you , '' said the master again .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 19]: Jack felt very indignant , and he thought that politeness was not quite so general as he supposed .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 9]: It happened that Captain Wilson was upon deck .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 69]: `` Come here , Mr Easy , '' said the captain ; `` it is a rule in the service , that no one gets on the hammocks , unless in case of emergency -- I never do -- nor the first lieutenant -- nor any of the officers or men , -- therefore , upon the principle of equality , you must not do it either . ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 47]: `` Certainly not , sir , '' replied Jack , `` but still I do not see why that officer in the shining hat should be so angry , and not speak to me as if I were a gentleman , as well as himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 13]: `` I have already explained that to you , Mr Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 28]: `` O yes , I recollect now , it 's zeal : but this zeal appears to me to be the only unpleasant thing in the service .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 19]: It 's a pity , as you said , that the service can not do without it . ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 49]: Captain Wilson laughed , and walked away ; and shortly afterwards , as he turned up and down the deck with the master , he hinted to him , that he should not speak so sharply to a lad who had committed such a trifling error through ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 52]: Now Mr Smallsole , the master , who was a surly sort of a personage , and did not like even a hint of disapprobation of his conduct , although very regardless of the feeling of others , determined to pay this off on Jack , the very first convenient opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 35]: Jack dined in the cabin , and was very much pleased to find that everyone drank wine with him , and that everybody at the captain 's table appeared to be on an equality .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 69]: Before the dessert had been on the table five minutes , Jack became loquacious on his favourite topic ; all the company stared with surprise at such an unheard-of doctrine being broached on board of a man-of-war ; the captain argued the point , so as to controvert , without too much offending , Jack 's notions , laughing the whole time that the conversation was carried on .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 48]: It will be observed , that this day may be considered as the first in which Jack really made his appearance on board , and it also was on this first day that Jack made known , at the captain 's table , his very peculiar notions .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 61]: If the company at the captain 's table , which consisted of the second lieutenant , purser , Mr Jolliffe , and one of the midshipmen , were astonished at such heterodox opinions being stated in the presence of the captain , they were equally astonished at the cool , good-humoured ridicule with which they were received by Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 76]: The report of Jack 's boldness , and every word and opinion that he had uttered -LRB- of course much magnified -RRB- was circulated that evening through the whole ship ; it was canvassed in the gun-room by the officers ; it was descanted upon by the midshipmen as they walked the deck ; the captain 's steward held a levee abreast of the ship 's funnel , in which he narrated this new doctrine .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 16]: The sergeant of marines gave his opinion in his berth , that it was damnable .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 83]: The boatswain talked over the matter with the other warrant officers , till the grog was all gone , and then dismissed it as too dry a subject : and it was the general opinion of the ship 's company , that as soon as they arrived at Gibraltar Bay , our hero would bid adieu to the service , either by being sentenced to death by a court-martial , or by being dismissed , and towed on shore on a grating .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 58]: Others , who had more of the wisdom of the serpent , and who had been informed by Mr Sawbridge that our hero was a lad who would inherit a large property , argued differently , and considered that Captain Wilson had very good reason for being so lenient -- and among them was the second lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 57]: There were but four who were well inclined towards Jack , -- to wit , the captain , the first lieutenant , Mr Jolliffe , the one-eyed master 's mate , and Mephistopheles , the black , who , having heard that Jack had uttered such sentiments , loved him with all his heart and soul .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 11]: We have referred to the second lieutenant , Mr Asper .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 23]: This young man had a very high respect for birth , and particularly for money , of which he had very little .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 73]: He was the son of an eminent merchant who , during the time that he was a midshipman , had allowed him a much larger sum for his expenses than was necessary or proper ; and , during his career , he found that his full pocket procured him consequence , not only among his own messmates , but also with many of the officers of the ships that he sailed in .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 61]: A man who is able and willing to pay a large tavern bill will always find followers -- that is , to the tavern ; and lieutenants did not disdain to dine , walk arm-in-arm , and be `` hail fellow well met '' with a midshipman , at whose expense they lived during the time they were on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 32]: Mr Asper had just received his commission and appointment , when his father became a bankrupt , and the fountain was dried up from which he had drawn such liberal supplies .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 68]: Since that , Mr Asper had felt that his consequence was gone : he could no longer talk about the service being a bore , or that he should give it up ; he could no longer obtain that deference paid to his purse , and not to himself ; and he had contracted very expensive habits , without having any longer the means of gratifying them .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 59]: It was therefore no wonder that he imbibed a great respect for money ; and , as he could no longer find the means himself , he was glad to pick up anybody else at whose cost he could indulge in that extravagance and expense to which he had been so long accustomed , and still sighed for .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 52]: Now , Mr Asper knew that our hero was well supplied with money , as he had obtained from the waiter the amount of the bill paid at the Fountain , and he had been waiting for Jack 's appearance on deck to become his very dearest and most intimate friend .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 41]: The conversation in the cabin made him feel assured that Jack would require and be grateful for support , and he had taken the opportunity of a walk with Mr Sawbridge , to offer to take Jack in his watch .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 82]: Whether it was that Mr Sawbridge saw through the design of Mr Asper , or whether he imagined that our hero would be better pleased with him than with the master , considering his harshness of deportment ; or with himself , who could not , as first lieutenant , overlook any remission of duty , the offer was accepted , and Jack Easy was ordered , as he now entered upon his duties , to keep watch under Lieutenant Asper .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 44]: But not only was this the first day that Jack may be said to have appeared in the service , but it was the first day in which he had entered the midshipman 's berth , and was made acquainted with his messmates .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 20]: We have already mentioned Mr Jolliffe , the master 's mate , but we must introduce him more particularly .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 35]: Nature is sometimes extremely arbitrary , and never did she show herself more so than in insisting that Mr Jolliffe should have the most sinister expression of countenance that ever had been looked upon .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 30]: He had suffered martyrdom with the small-pox , which probably had contracted his lineaments : his face was not only deeply pitted , but scarred with this cruel disorder .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 45]: One eye had been lost , and all eyebrows had disappeared -- and the contrast between the dull , sightless , opaque orb on one side of his face , and the brilliant , piercing little ball on the other , was almost terrifying .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 39]: His nose had been eaten away by the disease till it formed a sharp but irregular point ; part of the muscles of the chin were contracted , and it was drawn in with unnatural seams and puckers .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 25]: He was tall , gaunt , and thin , seldom smiled , and when he did , the smile produced a still further distortion .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 10]: Mr Jolliffe was the son of a warrant officer .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 23]: He did not contract this disease until he had been sent out to the West Indies , where it swept away hundreds .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 17]: He had now been long in the service , with little or no chance of promotion .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 19]: He had suffered from indigence , from reflections upon his humble birth , from sarcasms on his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 73]: Every contumely had been heaped upon him at one time or another , in the ships in which he served ; among a crowd he had found himself desolate -- and now , although no one dared treat him to his face with disrespect , he was only respected in the service from a knowledge of his utility and exemplary performance of his duties -- he had no friends or even companions .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 32]: For many years he had retired within himself , he had improved by reading and study , had felt all the philanthropy of a Christian , and extended it towards others .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 46]: Silent and reserved , he seldom spoke in the berth , unless his authority , as caterer , was called for ; all respected Mr Jolliffe , but no one liked , as a companion , one at whose appearance the very dogs would bark .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 30]: At the same time every one acknowledged his correct behaviour in every point , his sense of justice , his forbearance , his kindness , and his good sense .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 22]: With him life was indeed a pilgrimage , and he wended his way in all Christian charity and all Christian zeal .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 27]: In all societies , however small they may be , provided that they do but amount to half-a-dozen , you will invariably meet with a bully .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 23]: And it is also generally the case that you will find one of that society who is more or less the butt .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 24]: You will discover this even in occasional meetings , such as a dinner-party , the major part of which have never met before .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 36]: Previous to the removal of the cloth , the bully will have shown himself by his dictatorial manner , and will also have selected the one upon whom he imagines that he can best practise .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 37]: In a midshipman 's berth , this fact has become almost proverbial , although now perhaps it is not attended with that disagreeable despotism which was permitted at the time that our hero entered the service .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 45]: The bully of the midshipman 's berth of H.M. sloop Harpy Was a young man about seventeen , with light , curly hair , and florid countenance , the son of the clerk in the dockyard at Plymouth , and his name was Vigors .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 61]: The butt was a pudding-faced Tartar-physiognomied boy of fifteen , whose intellects , with fostering , if not great , might at least have been respectable , had he not lost all confidence in his own powers from the constant jeers and mockeries of those who had a greater fluency of speech without perhaps so much real power of mind .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 10]: Although slow , what he learnt he invariably retained .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 7]: This lad 's name was Gossett .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 12]: His father was a wealthy yeoman of Lynn , in Norfolk .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 135]: There were at the time but three other midshipmen in the ship , of whom it can only be said that they were like midshipmen in general , with little appetite for learning , but good appetites for dinner , hating everything like work , fond of everything like fun , fighting `` a L'outrance '' one minute , and sworn friends the next -- with general principles of honour and justice , but which were occasionally warped according to circumstances ; with all the virtues and vices so heterogeneously jumbled and heaped together , that it was almost impossible to ascribe any action to its true motive , and to ascertain to what point their vice was softened down into almost a virtue , and their virtues from mere excess degenerated into vice .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 10]: Their names were O'Connor , Mills , and Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 19]: The other shipmates of our hero it will be better to introduce as they appear on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 22]: After Jack had dined in the cabin , he followed his messmates Jolliffe and Gascoigne down into the midshipmen 's berth .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 40]: `` I say , Easy , '' observed Gascoigne , `` you are a devilish free and easy sort of a fellow , to tell the captain that you considered yourself as great a man as he was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 30]: `` I beg your pardon , '' replied Jack , `` I did not argue individually , but generally , upon the principles of the rights of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 49]: `` Well , '' replied Gascoigne , `` it 's the first time I ever heard a middy do such a bold thing ; take care your rights of man do n't get you in the wrong box -- there 's no arguing on board of a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 19]: The captain took it amazingly easy , but you 'd better not broach that subject too often . ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 82]: `` Gascoigne gives you very good advice , Mr Easy , '' observed Jolliffe ; `` allowing that your ideas are correct , which it appears to me they are not , or at least impossible to be acted upon , there is such a thing as prudence , and however much this question may be canvassed on shore , in his Majesty 's service it is not only dangerous in itself , but will be very prejudicial to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 11]: `` Man is a free agent , '' replied Easy .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 25]: `` I 'll be shot if a midshipman is , '' replied Gascoigne , laughing , aloud `` that you 'll soon find . ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 22]: `` And yet it was in the expectation of finding that equality that I was induced to come to sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 14]: `` On the first of April , I presume , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 8]: `` But are you really serious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 36]: Hereupon Jack entered into a long argument , to which Jolliffe and Gascoigne listened without interruption , and Mesty with admiration ; at the end of it , Gascoigne laughed heartily , and Jolliffe sighed .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 10]: `` From whence did you learn all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 3]: inquired Jolliffe .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 19]: `` From my father , who is a great philosopher , and has constantly upheld these opinions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 13]: `` And did your father wish you to go to sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 27]: `` No , he was opposed to it , '' replied Jack , `` but of course he could not combat my right and free-will . ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 28]: `` Mr Easy , as a friend , '' replied Jolliffe , `` I request that you would as much as possible keep your opinions to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 22]: I shall have an opportunity of talking to you on the subject and will then explain to you my reasons . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 25]: As soon as Mr Jolliffe had ceased , down came Mr Vigors and O'Connor , who had heard the news of Jack 's heresy .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 17]: `` You do not know Mr Vigors and Mr O'Connor , '' said Jolliffe to Easy .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 26]: Jack , who was the essence of politeness , rose and bowed , at which the others took their seats , without returning the salutation .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 29]: Vigors had , from what he had heard and now seen of Easy , thought he had somebody else to play upon , and without ceremony he commenced .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 62]: `` So , my chap , you are come on board to raise a mutiny here with your equality -- you came off scot free at the captain 's table ; but it wo n't do , I can tell you , even in the midshipman 's berth : some must knock under , and you are one of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 30]: `` If , sir , '' replied Easy , `` you mean by knock under , that I must submit , I can assure you that you are mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 26]: Upon the same principle that I would never play the tyrant to those weaker than myself , so will I resent oppression if attempted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 28]: `` Damme , but he 's a regular sea lawyer already : however , my boy , we 'll soon put your mettle to the proof . ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 18]: `` Am I then to infer that I am not on an equality with my messmates ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 7]: replied Jack , looking at Jolliffe .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 12]: The latter was about to answer him , but Vigors interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 86]: `` Yes , you are on an equality as far as this , that you have an equal right to the berth , if you are not knocked out of it for insolence to your masters ; that you have an equal share to pay for the things purchased for the mess , and an equal right to have your share , provided you can get it ; you have an equal right to talk , provided you are not told to hold your tongue .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 54]: The fact is , you have an equal right with everyone else to do as you can , get what you can , and say what you can , always provided that you can do it ; for here the weakest goes to the wall , and that is midshipman 's berth equality .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 18]: Now , do you understand all that ; or will you wait for a practical illustration ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 57]: `` I am then to infer that the equality here is as much destroyed as it even will be among savages , where the strong oppress the weak , and the only law is club law -- in fact , much the same as it is at a public or large school , on shore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 9]: `` I suspect you are right for once .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 15]: You were at a public school : how did they treat you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 16]: `` As you propose treating people here -- the weakest went to the wall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 29]: `` Well , then , a nod 's as good as a wink to a blind horse , that 's all , my hearty , '' said Vigors .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 21]: But the hands being turned up , `` Shorten sail '' put an end to the altercation for the present .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 20]: As our hero had not yet received orders to go to his duty , he remained below with Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 21]: `` By de powers , Massa Easy , but I lub you with my hole soul , '' said Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 45]: `` By Jasus , you really tark fine , Massa Easy ; dat Mr Vigor -- nebber care for him , would n't you help him -- and sure you would , '' continued the black , feeling the muscle of Jack 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 19]: `` By the soul of my fader , I 'd bet my week 's allowance on you anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 9]: Nebber be ` fraid , Massa Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 27]: `` I am not afraid , '' replied Jack ; `` I 've thrashed bigger fellows than he '' ; and Jack 's assertion was true .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 24]: Mr Bonnycastle never interfered in a fair fight , and took no notice of black eyes , provided the lessons there well said .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 31]: Jack had fought and fought again , until he was a very good bruiser , and although not so tall as Vigors , he was much better built for fighting .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 20]: A knowing Westminster boy would have bet his half-crown upon Jack had he seen him and his anticipated adversary .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 53]: The constant battles which Jack was obliged to fight at school had been brought forward by Jack against his father 's arguments in favour of equality , but they had been overruled by Mr Easy 's pointing out that the combats of boys had nothing to do with the rights of man .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 22]: As soon as the watch was called , Vigors , O'Connor , Gossett , and Gascoigne came down into the berth .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 44]: Vigors , who was the strongest in the berth , except Jolliffe , had successively had his superiority acknowledged , and , when on deck , he had talked of Easy 's impertinence , and his intention of bringing him to his senses .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 12]: The others , therefore , came down to see the fun .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 44]: `` Well , Mr Easy , '' observed Vigors , as he came into the berth , `` you take after your name , at all events ; I suppose you intend to eat the king 's provision , and do nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 7]: Jack 's mettle was already up .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 18]: `` You will oblige me , sir , by minding your own business , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 30]: `` You impudent blackguard , if you say another word , I 'll give you a good thrashing , and knock some of your equality out of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 24]: `` Indeed , '' replied Jack , who almost fancied himself back at Mr Bonnycastle 's ; `` we 'll try that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 60]: Whereupon Jack very coolly divested himself of his upper garments , neckerchief , and shirt , much to the surprise of Mr Vigors , who little contemplated such a proof of decision and confidence , and still more to the delight of the other midshipmen , who would have forfeited a week 's allowance to see Vigors well thrashed .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 38]: Vigors , however , knew that he had gone too far to retreat ; he therefore prepared for action ; and , when ready , the whole party went out into the steerage to settle the business .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 51]: Vigors had gained his assumed authority more by bullying than fighting ; others had submitted to him without a sufficient trial ; Jack , on the contrary , had won his way up in school by hard and scientific combat ; the result , therefore , may easily be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 50]: In less than a quarter of an hour Vigors , beaten dead , with his eyes closed , and three teeth out , gave in : while Jack , after a basin of water , looked as fresh as ever , with the exception of a few trifling scratches .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 29]: The news of this victory was soon through the ship ; and before Jack had resumed his clothes it had been told confidentially by Sawbridge to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 5]: `` So soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 27]: said Captain Wilson , laughing ; `` I expected that a midshipman 's berth would do wonders ; but I did not expect this yet awhile .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 22]: This victory is the first severe blow to Mr Easy 's equality , and will be more valuable than twenty defeats .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 16]: Let him now go to his duty , he will soon find his level . ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 18]: CHAPTER XI In which our hero proves that all on board should equally sacrifice decency to duty .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 36]: The success of any young man in a profession very much depends upon the occurrences at the commencement of his career , as from those is his character judged , and he is treated accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 47]: Jack had chosen to enter the service at a much later period than most lads ; he was tall and manly for his age , and his countenance , if not strictly handsome , wore that expression of honesty and boldness which is sure to please .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 44]: His spirit in not submitting to , and meeting , Vigors when he had hardly recovered from his severe prostration of sea-sickness , had gained him with the many respect , and with all , except his antagonist and Mr Smallsole , good-will .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 132]: Instead of being laughed at by his messmates , he was played with ; for Jolliffe smiled at his absurdities , and attempted to reason him out of them , and the others liked Jack for himself and his generosity , and moreover , because they looked up to him as a protector against Vigors , who had persecuted them all ; for Jack had declared , that as might was right in a midshipman 's berth , he would so far restore equality , that if he could not put down those who were the strongest , at all events he would protect the weak , and , let who would come into the berth , they must be his master before they should tyrannise over those weaker than he .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 76]: Thus did Jack Easy make the best use that he could of his strength , and become , as it were , the champion and security of those who , although much longer at sea and more experienced than he was , were glad to shelter themselves under his courage and skill , the latter of which had excited the admiration of the butcher of the ship , who had been a pugilist by profession .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 22]: Thus did Jack at once take the rank of an oldster , and soon became the leader of all the mischief .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 28]: We particularly observe this , because , had it so happened that our hero had succumbed to Vigors , the case would have been the very reverse .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 44]: He then would have had to go through the ordeal to which most who enter the naval service are exposed , which can not be better explained than by comparing it to the fagging carried to such an iniquitous extent in public schools .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 34]: Mr Asper , for his own reasons , made him his companion : they walked the night watch together , and he listened to all Jack 's nonsense about the rights of man .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 49]: And here Mr Asper did good without intending it , for , at the same time that he appeared to agree with Jack , to secure his favour , he cautioned him , and pointed out why this equality could not exist altogether on board of a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 49]: As for himself , he said , he saw no difference between a lieutenant , or even a captain , and a midshipman , provided they were gentlemen : he should choose his friends where he liked , and despised that power of annoyance which the service permitted .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 43]: Of course , Jack and Mr Asper were good friends , especially as , when half the watch was over , to conciliate his good-will and to get rid of his eternal arguing , Mr Asper would send Jack down to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 73]: They were now entering the Straits , and expected to anchor the next day at Gibraltar , and Jack was forward on the forecastle , talking with Mesty , with whom he had contracted a great friendship , for there was nothing that Mesty would not have done for Jack , although he had not been three weeks in the ship ; but a little reflection will show that it was natural .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 71]: Mesty had been a great man in his own country ; he had suffered all the horrors of a passage in a slave ship ; he had been sold as a slave twice ; he had escaped -- but he found that the universal feeling was strong against his colour , and that on board of a man-of-war he was condemned , although free , to the humblest of offices .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 108]: He had never heard anyone utter the sentiments , which now beat in his own heart , of liberty and equality -- we say now , for when he was in his own country before his captivity , he had no ideas of equality ; no one has who is in power : but he had been schooled ; and although people talked of liberty and equality at New York , he found that what they preached for themselves , they did not practise towards others , and that , in the midst of liberty and equality , he and thousands more were enslaved and degraded beings .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 67]: Escaping to England , he had regained his liberty , but not his equality ; his colour had prevented the latter , and in that feeling all the world appeared to conspire together against him , until , to his astonishment , he heard those sentiments boldly expressed from the lips of Jack , and that in a service where it was almost tantamount to mutiny .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 26]: Mesty , whose character is not yet developed , immediately took a fondness for our hero , and in a hundred ways showed his attachment .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 42]: Jack also liked Mesty , and was fond of talking with him , and every evening , since the combat with Vigors , they had generally met in the forecastle to discuss the principles of equality and the rights of man .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 51]: The boatswain , whose name was Biggs , was a slight , dapper , active little man , who , as captain of the foretop , had shown an uncommon degree of courage in a hurricane , so much so , as to recommend him to the Admiral for promotion .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 30]: It was given to him ; and after the ship to which he had been appointed was paid off , he had been ordered to join H.M. sloop Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 20]: Jack 's conversation with Mesty was interrupted by the voice of the boatswain , who was haranguing his boy .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 45]: `` It 's now ten minutes , sir , by my repeater , '' said the boatswain , `` that I have sent for you '' ; and Mr Biggs pulled out a huge silver watch , almost as big as a Norfolk turnip .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 21]: A Jew had sold him the watch ; the boatswain had heard of repeaters , and wished to have one .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 29]: Moses had only shown him watches with the hour and minute hands ; he now produced one with a second hand , telling him it was a repeater .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 8]: `` What makes it a repeater ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 4]: inquired the boatswain .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 26]: `` Common watches , '' said the cunning Jew , `` only tell the minutes and hours ; but all repeaters tell the seconds . ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 33]: The boatswain was satisfied -- bought the watch , and , although many had told him it was no repeater , he insisted that it was , and would call it so .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 22]: `` I swear , '' continued the boatswain , `` it 's ten minutes and twenty seconds by my repeater . ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 36]: `` If you please , sir , '' said the boy , `` I was changing my trousers when you sent for me , and then I had to stow away my bag again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 36]: `` Silence , sir ; I 'd have you to know that when you are sent for by your officer , trousers or no trousers , it is your duty to come up directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 7]: `` Without trousers , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 4]: replied the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 21]: `` Yes , sir , without trousers ; if the captain required me , I should come without my shirt .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 5]: Duty before decency . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 11]: So saying , the boatswain lays hold of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 28]: `` Surely , Mr Biggs , '' said Jack , `` you are not going to punish that boy for not coming up without his trousers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 16]: `` Yes , Mr Easy , I am -- I must teach him a lesson .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 47]: We are bound , now that newfangled ideas are brought into the ship , to uphold the dignity of the service ; and the orders of an officer are not to be delayed ten minutes and twenty seconds because a boy has no trousers on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 34]: Whereupon the boatswain administered several smart cuts with his rattan upon the boy , proving that it was quite as well that he had put on his trousers before he came on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 44]: `` There , '' said Mr Biggs , `` is a lesson for you , you scamp -- and , Mr Easy , it is a lesson for you also , '' continued the boatswain , walking away with a most consequential air .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 5]: `` Murder Irish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 9]: said Mesty -- `` how him cut caper .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 18]: De oder day he haul out de weather ear-ring , and touch him hat to a midshipman .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 9]: Sure enough , make um cat laugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 42]: The next day the Harpy was at anchor in Gibraltar Bay ; the captain went on shore , directing the gig to be sent for him before nine o'clock ; after which hour the sally-port is only opened by special permission .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 31]: There happened to be a ball given by the officers of the garrison on that evening , and a polite invitation was sent to the officers of H.M. sloop Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 23]: As those who accepted the invitation would be detained late , it was not possible for them to come off that night .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 46]: And as their services were required for the next day , Captain Wilson allowed them to remain on shore until seven o'clock the next morning , at which hour , as there was a large party , there would be two boats sent for them .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 21]: Mr Asper obtained leave , and asked permission to take our hero with him ; to which Mr Sawbridge consented .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 37]: Many other officers obtained leave , and , among others , the boatswain , who , aware that his services would be in request as soon as the equipment commenced , asked permission for this evening .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 21]: And Mr Sawbridge , feeling that he could be better spared at this than at any other time , consented .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 38]: Asper and Jack went to an inn , dined , bespoke beds , and then dressed themselves for the ball , which was very brilliant , and , from the company of the officers , very pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 14]: Captain Wilson looked on at the commencement , and then returned on board .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 27]: Jack behaved with his usual politeness , danced till two o'clock , and then , as the ball thinned , Asper proposed that they should retires .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 73]: Having once more applied to the refreshment-room , they had procured their hats , and were about to depart , when one of the officers of the garrison asked Jack if he would like to see a baboon , which had just been brought down from the rock ; and , taking some of the cakes , they repaired to the court where the animal was chained down to a small tank .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 48]: Jack fed the brute till all the cakes were gone , and then , because he had no more to give him , the baboon flew at Jack , who , in making his retreat fell back into the tank , which was about two feet deep .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 22]: This was a joke , and having laughed heartily , they wished the officer good-night , and went to the inn .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 49]: Now , what with the number of officers of the Harpy on shore , who had all put up at the same inn , and other occupants , the landlord was obliged to put his company into double and treble-bedded rooms ; but this was of little consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 29]: Jack was shown into a double-bedded room , and proceeded to undress ; the other was evidently occupied , by the heavy breathing which saluted Jack 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 53]: As Jack undressed , he recollected that his trousers were wet through , and to dry them he opened the window , hung them out , and then jammed down the window again upon them , to hold them in their position , after which he turned in and fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 31]: At six o'clock he was called , as he had requested , and proceeded to dress , but to his astonishment found the window thrown open and his trousers missing .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 41]: It was evident , that his partner in the room had thrown the window open during the night , and that his trousers , having fallen down into the street , had been walked off with by somebody or another .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 25]: Jack looked out of the window once more , and perceived that whoever had thrown open the window had been unwell during the night .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 18]: A nice drunken companion I have had , thought Jack ; but what 's to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 23]: And in saying this , he walked up to the other bed , and perceived that it was tenanted by the boatswain .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 38]: Well , thought Jack , as Mr Biggs has thought proper to lose my trousers , I think I have a right to take his , or at least the wear of them to go on board .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 33]: It was but last night he declared that decency must give way to duty , and that the orders of a superior officer were to be obeyed , with or without garments .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 26]: I know he is obliged to be on board , and now he shall try how he likes to obey orders in his shirt tails .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 38]: So cogitating , Jack took the trousers of the boatswain , who still snored , although he had been called , and putting them on , completed the rest of his dress , and quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 60]: He went to that of Mr Asper , where he found him just ready , and , having paid the bill -- for Asper had forgotten his purse -- they proceeded down to the sally-port , where they found other officers waiting , sufficient to load the first boat , which shoved off , and they went on board .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 60]: As soon as he was down below , Jack hastened to change his trousers , and , unobserved by anyone , threw those belonging to Mr Biggs on a chair in his cabin , and , having made a confidant of Mesty , who was delighted , he went on deck , and waited the issue of the affair .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 35]: Before Jack left the hotel , he had told the waiter that there was the boatswain still fast asleep , and that he must be roused up immediately ; and this injunction was obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 45]: The boatswain , who had drunk too much the night before , and , as Jack had truly imagined , had opened the window because he was unwell , was wakened up , and hearing how late it was , hastened to dress himself .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 66]: Not finding his trousers , he rang the bell , supposing that they had been taken down to be brushed , and , in the meantime , put on everything else , that he might lose no time : the waiter who answered the bell , denied having taken the trousers out of the room , and poor Mr Biggs was in a sad quandary .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 85]: What had become of them , he could not tell : he had no recollection of having gone to bed the night before ; he inquired of the waiter , who said that he knew nothing about them -- that he was very tipsy when he came home , and that when he called him , he had found the window open , and it appeared that he had been unwell -- he supposed that he had thrown his trousers out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 10]: Time flew , and the boatswain was in despair .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 9]: `` Could they lend him a pair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 8]: `` He would call his master . ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 28]: The master of the inn knew very well the difference of rank between officers , and those whom he could trust and those whom he could not .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 26]: He sent up the bill by the waiter , and stated that , for a deposit , the gentleman might have a pair of trousers .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 19]: The boatswain felt in his pockets and remembered that all his money was in his trousers ' pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 16]: He could not only not leave a deposit , but could not pay his bill .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 5]: The landlord was inexorable .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 16]: It was bad enough to lose his money , but he could not lose more .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 13]: `` I shall be tried by a court-martial , by heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 47]: exclaimed the boatswain -- `` it 's not far from the sally-port : I 'll make a run for it , and I can slip into one of the boats and get another pair of trousers before I report myself as having come on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 40]: So making up his mind , the boatswain took to his heels , and with his check shirt tails streaming in the wind , ran as hard as he could to where the boat was waiting to receive him .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 60]: He was encountered by many , but he only ran the faster the more they jeered , and , at last , arrived breathless at his goal , flew down the steps , jumped into the boat , and squatted on the stern sheets , much to the surprise of the officers and men , who thought him mad .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 37]: He stated in a few words that somebody had stolen his trousers during the night ; and as it was already late , the boat shoved off the men as well as officers convulsed with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 9]: `` Have any of you a pea-jacket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 22]: inquired the boatswain of the men -- but the weather was so warm that none of them had brought a pea-jacket .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 16]: The boatswain looked round ; he perceived that the officers were sitting on a boat-cloak .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 7]: `` Whose boat-cloak is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 4]: inquired the boatswain .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 7]: `` Mine , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 25]: `` I trust , Mr Gascoigne , you will have the kindness to lend it to me to go up the side with . ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 59]: `` Indeed I will not , '' replied Gascoigne , who would sooner have thrown it overboard and have lost it , than not beheld the anticipated fun : `` recollect I asked you for a fishing-line , when we were becalmed off Cape St Vincent , and you sent word that you 'd see me dead first .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 15]: Now I 'll just see you the same before you have my boat-cloak . ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 20]: `` Oh , Mr Gascoigne , I 'll give you three lines , directly I get on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 14]: `` I dare say you will , but that wo n't do now .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 33]: ` Tit for tat , ' Mr Boatswain , and hang all favours , '' replied Gascoigne , who was steering the boat , having been sent on shore for the others .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 7]: `` In borrowed of all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 84]: The boat was laid alongside -- the relentless Gascoigne caught up his boat-cloak as the other officers rose to go on board , and rolling it up , in spite of the earnest entreaties of Mr Biggs , tossed it into the main chains , to the man who had thrown the stem fast ; and to make the situation of Mr Biggs still more deplorable , the first lieutenant was standing looking into the boat , and Captain Wilson walking the quarter-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 37]: `` Come , Mr Biggs , I expected you off in the first boat , '' cried Mr Sawbridge ; `` be as smart as you please , for the yards are not yet squared . ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 16]: `` Shall I go ahead in this boat , and square them , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 4]: `` That boat !
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 16]: no ; let her drop astern , jump up here and lower down the dinghy .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 12]: What the devil do you sit there for , Mr Biggs ?
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 31]: -- you 'll oblige me by showing a little more activity , or , by Jove , you may save yourself the trouble of asking to go on shore again .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 7]: Are you sober , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 7]: The last observation decided Mr Biggs .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 22]: He sprung up from the boat just as he was , and touched his hat as he passed the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 14]: `` Perfectly sober , sir , but I 've lost my trousers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 68]: `` So it appears , sir , '' replied Mr Sawbridge , as Mr Biggs stood on the plane shear of the sloop where the hammock netting divides for an entrance , with his shirt tails fluttering in the sea breeze ; but Mr Sawbridge could not contain himself any longer ; he ran down the ship ladder which led on the quarter-deck , choked with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 30]: Mr Biggs could not descend until after Mr Sawbridge , and the conversation had attracted the notice of all , and every eye in the ship was on him .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 7]: `` What 's all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 9]: said Captain Wilson , coming to the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 16]: `` Duty before decency , '' replied Jack , who stood by enjoying the joke .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 33]: Mr Biggs recollected the day before -- he cast a furious look at Jack , as he touched his hat to the captain , and then dived down to the lower deck .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 25]: If anything could add to the indignation of the boatswain , it was to find that his trousers had come on board before him .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 59]: He now felt that a trick had been played him , and also that our hero must have been the party , but he could prove nothing ; he could not say who slept in the same room , for he was fast asleep when Jack went to bed , and fast asleep when Jack quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 23]: The truth of the story soon became known to all the ship , and `` duty before decency '' became a bye-word .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 28]: All that the boatswain could do he did , which was to revenge himself upon the poor boy -- and Gascoigne and Jack never got any fishing-tackle .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 63]: The boatswain was as obnoxious to the men as Vigors , and in consequence of Jack 's known opinions upon the rights of man , and his having floored their two greatest enemies , he became a great favourite with the seamen , and as all favourites are honoured by them with a soubriquet , our hero obtained that of Equality Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 31]: CHAPTER XII In which our hero prefers going down to going up ; a choice , it is to be hoped , he will reverse upon a more important occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 57]: The next day being Sunday , the hands were turned up to divisions , and the weather not being favourable , instead of the service the articles of war were read with all due respect shown to the same , the captain , officers , and crew , with their hats off in a mizzling rain .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 52]: Jack , who had been told by the captain that these articles of war were the rules and regulations of the service , by which the captain , officers , and men , were equally bound , listened to them as they were read by the clerk with the greatest attention .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 44]: He little thought that there were about five hundred orders from the Admiralty tacked on to them , which , like the numerous codicils of some wills , contained the most important matter , and to a certain degree make the will nugatory .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 63]: Jack listened very attentively , and , as each article was propounded , felt that he was not likely to commit himself in that point , and , although he was rather astonished to find such a positive injunction against swearing considered quite a dead letter in the ship , he thought that , altogether , he saw his way very clear .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 30]: But to make certain of it , as soon as the hands had been piped down he begged the clerk to let him have a copy of the articles .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 74]: Now the clerk had three , being the allowance of the ship , or at least all that he had in his possession , and made some demur at parting with one ; but at last he proposed -- `` some rascal , '' as he said , having stolen his tooth-brush -- that if Jack would give him one he would give him one of the copies of the articles of war .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 30]: Jack replied that the one he had in use was very much worn , and that unfortunately he had but one new one , which he could not spare .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 39]: Thereupon the clerk , who was a very clean personage , and could not bear that his teeth should be dirty , agreed to accept the one in use , as Jack could not part with the other .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 27]: The exchange was made , and Jack read the articles of war over and over again , till he thought he was fully master of them .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 82]: `` Now , '' says Jack , `` I know what I am to do , and what I am to expect , and these articles of war I will carry in my pocket as long as I 'm in the service ; that is to say , if they last so long : and provided they do not , I am able to replace them with another old tooth-brush , which appears to be the value attached to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 53]: The Harpy remained a fortnight in Gibraltar Bay , and Jack had occasionally a run on shore , and Mr Asper invariably went with him to keep him out of mischief ; that is to say , he allowed him to throw his money away on no one more worthless than himself .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 15]: One morning Jack went down in the berth , and found young Gossett blubbering .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 12]: `` What 's the matter , my dear Mr Gossett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 18]: inquired Jack , who was just as polite to the youngster as he was to anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 22]: `` Vigors has been thrashing me with a rope 's end , '' replied Gossett , rubbing his arm and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 3]: inquired Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 58]: `` Because he says the service is going to hell -- -LRB- I 'm sure it 's no fault of mine -RRB- -- and that now all subordination is destroyed , and that upstarts join the ship who , because they have a five-pound note in their pocket , are allowed to do just as they please .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 65]: He said he was determined to uphold the service , and then he knocked me down -- and when I got up again he told me that I could stand a little more -- and then he took out his colt , and said he was determined to ride the high horse -- and that there should be no Equality Jack in future . ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 7]: `` Well , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 17]: `` And then he colted me for half an hour , and that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 58]: `` By de soul of my fader , but it all for true , Massa Easy -- he larrup um , sure enough -- all for noting , bad luck to him -- I tink , '' continued Mesty , `` he hab debelish bad memory -- and he want a little more of Equality Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 48]: `` And he shall have it too , '' replied our hero ; `` why it 's against the articles of war , ` all quarrelling , fighting , & c. ' I say , Mr Gossett , have you got the spirit of a louse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' replied Gossett .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 23]: `` Well , then , will you do what I tell you next time , and trust to me for protection ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 26]: `` I do n't care what I do , '' replied the boy , `` if you will back me against the cowardly tyrant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 8]: `` Do you refer to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 13]: cried Vigors , who had stopped at the door of the berth .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 8]: `` Say yes , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 10]: `` Yes , I do , '' cried Gossett .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 7]: `` You do , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 28]: -- well , then , my chick , I must trouble you with a little more of this , '' said Vigors , drawing out his colt .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 16]: `` I think that you had better not , Mr Vigors , '' observed Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 20]: `` Mind your own business , if you please , '' returned Vigors , not much liking the interference .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 21]: `` I am not addressing my conversation to you , and I will thank you never to interfere with me .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 28]: I presume I have a right to choose my own acquaintance , and , depend upon it , it will not be that of a leveller . ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 46]: `` All that is at your pleasure , Mr Vigors , '' replied Jack ; `` you have a right to choose your own acquaintance , and so have I a right to choose my own friends , and , further , to support them .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 10]: That lad is my friend , Mr Vigors . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 49]: `` Then , '' replied Vigors , who could not help bullying even at the risk of another combat which he probably intended to stand , `` I shall take the liberty of giving your friend a thrashing '' ; and he suited the action to the word .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 74]: `` Then I shall take the liberty to defend my friend , '' replied Jack ; `` and as you call me a leveller , I 'll try if I may not deserve the name '' whereupon Jack placed a blow so well under the ear , that Mr Vigors dropped on the deck , and was not in a condition to come to the scratch , even if he had been inclined .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 41]: `` And now , youngster , '' said Jack , wresting the colt out of Vigors ' hand , `` do as I bid you -- give him a good colting if you do n't I 'll thrash you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 29]: Gossett required no second threat ; -- the pleasure of thrashing his enemy , if only for once , was quite enough -- and he laid well on .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 43]: Jack with his fists doubled ready to protect him if there was a show of resistance , but Vigors was half stupefied with the blow under the ear , and quite cowed ; he took his thrashing in the most pensive manner .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 48]: `` That will do , '' said Jack ; `` and now do not be afraid , Gossett ; the very first time he offers to strike you when I am not present , I will pay him off for it as soon as you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 11]: I wo n't be called Equality Jack for nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 54]: When Jolliffe , who heard of this , met our hero alone , he said to him , `` Take my advice , boy , and do not in future fight the battles of others ; you 'll find very soon that you will have enough to do to fight your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 15]: Whereupon Jack argued the point for half an hour , and then they separated .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 6]: But Mr Jolliffe was right .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 50]: Jack began to find himself constantly in hot water , and the captain and first lieutenant , although they did not really withdraw their protection , thought it high time that Jack should find out that , on board a man-of-war , everybody and everything must find its level .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 59]: There was on board of his Majesty 's sloop Harpy , a man of the name of Easthupp , who did the duty of purser 's steward ; this was the second ship that he had served in : in the former he had been sent with a draft of men from the Tender lying off the Tower .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 50]: How he had come into the service was not known in the present ship ; but the fact was , that he had been one of the swell mob -- and had been sent on board the Tender with a letter of recommendation from the magistrates to Captain Crouch .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 37]: He was a cockney by birth , for he had been left at the work-house of St Mary Axe , where he had been taught to read and write , and had afterwards made his escape .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 45]: He joined the juvenile thieves of the metropolis , had been sent to Bridewell , obtained his liberty , and by degrees had risen from petty thieving of goods exposed outside of the shops and market-stalls , to the higher class of gentleman pickpockets .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 27]: His appearance was somewhat genteel , with a bullying sort of an impudent air , which is mistaken for fashion by those who know no better .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 68]: A remarkable neat dresser , for that was part of his profession ; a very plausible manner and address ; a great fluency of language , although he clipped the king 's English ; and , as he had suffered more than once by the law , it is not to be wondered at , that he was , as he called himself , a hout-and-hout radical .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 50]: During the latter part of his service , in his last ship , he had been employed under the purser 's steward , and having offered himself in this capacity to the purser of H.M. sloop Harpy , with one or two forged certificates , he had been accepted .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 51]: Now , when Mr Easthupp heard of Jack 's opinion , he wished to cultivate his acquaintance , and with a bow and a flourish , introduced himself before they arrived at Gibraltar ; but our hero took an immediate dislike to this fellow from his excessive and impertinent familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 44]: Jack knew a gentleman when he met one , and did not choose to be a companion to a man beneath him in every way , but who , upon the strength of Jack 's liberal opinions , presumed to be his equal .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 32]: Jack 's equality did not go so far as that ; in theory it was all very well , but in practice it was only when it suited his own purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 67]: But the purser 's steward was not to be checked -- a man who has belonged to the swell mob is not easily repulsed ; and , although Jack would plainly show him that his company was not agreeable , Easthupp would constantly accost him familiarly on the forecastle and lower deck , with his arms folded , and with an air almost amounting to familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 51]: At last , Jack told him to go about his business and not presume to talk to him ; whereupon Easthupp rejoined , and after an exchange of hard words , it ended by Jack kicking Mr Easthupp , as he called himself , down the after -- lower-deck hatchway .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 48]: This was but a sorry specimen of Jack 's equality -- and Mr Easthupp , who considered that his honour had been compromised , went up to the captain on the quarter-deck and lodged his complaint -- whereupon Captain Wilson desired that Mr Easy might be summoned .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 14]: As soon as Jack made his appearance , Captain Wilson called to Easthupp .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 16]: `` Now , purser 's steward , what is this you have to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 53]: `` If you please , Captain Vilson , I am wery sorry to be obliged to make hany complaint of hany hofficer , but this Mr Heasy thought proper to make use of language quite hunbecoming of a gentleman , and then to kick me as I vent down the atchvay . ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 11]: `` Well , Mr Easy , is this true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 28]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` I have several times told the fellow not to address himself to me , and he will .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 20]: I did tell him he was a radical blackguard , and I did kick him down the hatchway . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 14]: `` You told him he was a radical blackguard , Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 27]: `` Yes , sir , he comes bothering me about his republic , and asserting that we have no want of a king and aristocracy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 8]: Captain Wilson looked significantly at Mr Sawbridge .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 37]: `` I certainly did hoffer my political opinions , Captain Vilson ; but you must be avare that ve hall ave an hequal stake in the country -- and it 's a Hinglishman 's birthright . ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 46]: `` I 'm not aware what your stake in the country may be , Mr Easthupp , '' observed Captain Wilson , `` but I think that , if you used such expressions , Mr Easy was fully warranted in telling you his opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 31]: `` I ham villing , Captain Vilson , to make hany hallowance for the eat of political discussion -- but that is not hall that I ave to complain hof .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 16]: Mr Heasy thought proper to say that I was a swindler and a liar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 13]: `` Did you make use of those expressions , Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 36]: `` Yes , sir , he did , '' continued the steward ; `` and , moreover , told me not to cheat the men , and not to cheat my master , the purser .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 18]: Now , Captain Vilson , is it not true that I am in a wery hostensible sitevation ?
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 57]: but I flatter myself that I ave been vell edecated , and vos wonce moving in a wery different society -- misfortains vill appin to us hall , and I feel my character has been severely injured by such importations '' ; whereupon Mr Easthupp took out his handkerchief , flourished , and blew his nose .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 69]: `` I told Mr Heasy , that I considered myself quite as much of a gentleman as himself , and at hall hewents did not keep company with a black feller -LRB- Mr Heasy will hunderstand the insinevation -RRB- ; vereupon Mr Heasy , as I before said , your vorship , I mean you , Captain Vilson , thought proper to kick me down the atchvay . ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 19]: `` Very well , steward , I have heard your complaint , and now you may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 21]: Mr Easthupp took his hat off with an air , made his bow , and went down the main ladder .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 45]: `` Mr Easy , '' said Captain Wilson , `` you must be aware that by the regulations of the service by which we are all equally bound , it is not permitted that any officer shall take the law into his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 74]: Now , although I do not consider it necessary to make any remark as to your calling the man a radical blackguard , for I consider his impertinent intrusion of his opinions deserved it , still you have no right to attack any man 's character without grounds -- and as that man is in an office of trust , you were not at all warranted in asserting that he was a cheat .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 14]: Will you explain to me why you made use of such language ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 40]: Now our hero had no proofs against the man ; he had nothing to offer in extenuation , until he recollected , all at once , the reason assigned by the captain for the language used by Mr Sawbridge .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 35]: Jack had the wit to perceive that it would hit home , so he replied , very quietly and respectfully : `` If you please , Captain Wilson , that was all zeal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 6]: `` Zeal , Mr Easy ?
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 8]: I think it but a bad excuse .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 15]: But pray , then , why did you kick the man down the hatchway ?
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 17]: -- you must have known that that was contrary to the rules of the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 21]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Jack , demurely ; `` but that was all zeal , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 44]: `` Then allow me to say , '' replied Captain Wilson , biting his lips , `` that I think that your zeal has in this instance been very much misplaced , and I trust you will not show so much again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 57]: `` And yet , sir , '' replied Jack , aware that he was giving the captain a hard hit , and therefore looked proportionally humble , `` we should do nothing in the service without it -- and I trust one day , as you told me , to become a very zealous officer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 15]: `` I trust so , too , Mr Easy , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 21]: `` There , you may go now , and let me hear no more of kicking people down the hatchway .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 8]: That sort of zeal is misplaced . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 20]: `` More than my foot was , at all events , '' muttered Jack , as he walked off .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 31]: Captain Wilson , as soon as our hero disappeared , laughed heartily , and told Mr Sawbridge , `` he had ascribed his language to our hero as all zeal .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 35]: He has very cleverly given me it all back again ; and really , Sawbridge , as it proves how weak was my defence of you , you may gain from this lesson . ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 20]: Sawbridge thought so , too -- but both agreed that Jack 's rights of man were in considerable danger .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 65]: The day before the ship sailed , the captain and Mr Asper dined with the Governor ; and as there was little more to do , Mr Sawbridge , who had not quitted the ship since she had been in port , and had some few purchases to make , left her in the afternoon in the charge of Mr Smallsole , the master .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 38]: Now , as we have observed , he was Jack 's inveterate enemy -- indeed Jack had already made three , Mr Smallsole , Mr Biggs , the boatswain , and Easthupp , the purser 's steward .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 33]: Mr Smallsole was glad to be left in command , as he hoped to have an opportunity of punishing our hero , who certainly laid himself not a little open to it .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 53]: Like all those who are seldom in command , the master was proportionally tyrannical and abusive -- he swore at the men , made them do the duty twice and thrice over , on the pretence that it was not smartly done , and found fault with every officer remaining on board .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 17]: `` Mr Biggs -- by God , sir , you seem to be all asleep forward .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 20]: I suppose you think that you are to do nothing now the first lieutenant is out of the ship ?
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 17]: How long will it be , sir , before you are ready to sway away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 31]: `` By de holy poker , I tink he sway away finely , Massy Easy , '' observed Mesty , who was in converse with our hero on the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 58]: Mr Smallsole 's violence made Mr Biggs violent , which made the boatswain 's mate violent -- and the captain of the forecastle violent also ; all which is practically exemplified by philosophy in the laws of motion , communicated from one body to another ; and as Mr Smallsole swore , so did the boatswain swear .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 23]: Also the boatswain 's mate , the captain of the forecastle , and all the men -- showing the force of example .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 5]: Mr Smallsole came forward .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 13]: `` Damnation , Mr Biggs , what the devil are you about ?
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 7]: Ca n't you move here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 24]: `` As much as we can , sir , '' replied the boatswain , `` lumbered as the forecastle is with idlers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 18]: And here Mr Biggs looked at our hero and Mesty , who were standing against the bulwark .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 10]: `` What are you doing here , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 7]: cried Mr Smallsole to our hero .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 8]: `` Nothing at all , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 3]: replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 12]: `` Then I 'll give you something to do , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 15]: Go up to the mast-head , and wait there till I call you down .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 19]: Come , sir , I 'll show you the way , '' continued the master , walking aft .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 9]: Jack followed till they were on the quarter-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 23]: `` Now , sir , up to the main-top gallant mast-head ; perch yourself upon the cross-trees -- up with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 13]: `` What am I to go up there for , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 3]: inquired Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 11]: `` For punishment , sir , '' replied the master .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 9]: `` What have I done , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 11]: `` No reply , sir -- up with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 23]: `` If you please , sir , '' replied Jack , `` I should wish to argue this point a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 6]: `` Argue the point ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 24]: roared Mr Smallsole -- `` By Jove , I 'll teach you to argue the point -- away with you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 37]: `` If you please , sir , '' continued Jack , `` the captain told me that the articles of war were the rules and regulations by which everyone in the service was to be guided .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 36]: Now , sir , '' said Jack , `` I have read them over till I know them by heart , and there is not one word of mastheading in the whole of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 14]: Here Jack took the articles out of his pocket , and unfolded them .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 16]: `` Will you go to the mast-head , sir , or will you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 4]: said Mr Smallsole .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 16]: `` Will you show me the mast-head in the articles of war , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 9]: replied Jack ; `` here they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 34]: `` I tell you , sir , to go to the mast-head : if not , I 'll be d -- d if I do n't hoist you up in a bread-bag . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 117]: `` There 's nothing about bread-bags in the articles of war , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` but I 'll tell you what there is , sir '' ; and Jack commenced reading , -- `` All flag-officers , and all persons in or belonging to his Majesty 's ships or vessels of war , being guilty of profane oaths , execrations , drunkenness , uncleanness , or other scandalous actions , in derogation of God 's honour and corruption of good manners , shall incur such punishment as -- '' `` Damnation , '' cried the master , who was mad with rage , hearing that the whole ship 's company were laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 33]: `` No , sir , not damnation , '' replied Jack , `` that 's when he 's tried above ; but according to the nature and degree of the offence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 16]: `` Will you go to the mast-head , sir , or will you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 16]: `` If you please , '' replied Jack , `` I 'd rather not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 22]: `` Then , sir , consider yourself under an arrest -- I 'll try you by a court-martial , by God .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 7]: Go down below , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 33]: `` With the greatest pleasure , sir , '' replied Jack , `` that 's all right and according to the articles of war , which are to guide us all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 21]: Jack folded up his articles of war , put them into his pocket , and went down into the berth .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 46]: Soon after Jack had gone down , Jolliffe , who had heard the whole of the altercation , followed him : `` My lad , '' said Jolliffe , `` I 'm sorry for all this ; you should have gone to the mast-head . ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 15]: `` I should like to argue that point a little , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 46]: `` Yes , so would everybody ; but if that were permitted , the service would be at a stand-still -- that would not do ; -- you must obey an order first , and then complain afterwards , if the order is unjust . ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 12]: `` It is not so in the articles of war . ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 10]: `` But it is so in the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 28]: `` The captain told me that the articles of war were the guides of the service , and we were all equally bound to obey them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 20]: `` Well , but allowing that , I do not think your articles of war will bear you out .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 20]: You observe , they say any officer , mariner , etc , guilty of disobedience to any lawful command .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 10]: Now are you not guilty under that article ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 12]: `` That remains to be argued still , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 17]: `` A lawful command means an order established by law ; now where is that law ?
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 46]: -- besides , the captain told me when I kicked that blackguard down the hatchway , that there was only the captain who could punish , and that officers could not take the law into their own hands ; why then has the master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 19]: `` His doing wrong as superior officer is no reason why you as an inferior should disobey him .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 33]: If that were permitted , -- if every order were to be cavilled at , and argued upon , as just or unjust , there would be an end of all discipline .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 19]: Besides , recollect that in the service there is custom , which is the same as law . ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 12]: `` That admits of a little argument , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 62]: `` The service will admit of none , my dear boy : recollect that , even on shore , we have two laws , that which is written , and the ` lex non scripta , ' which is custom ; of course we have it in the service , for the articles of war can not provide for everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 13]: `` They provide a court-martial for everything though , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 19]: `` Yes , with death or dismissal from the service -- neither of which would be very agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 59]: You have got yourself into a scrape , and although the captain is evidently your friend , he can not overlook it : fortunately , it is with the master , which is of less consequence than with the other officers ; but still you will have to submit , for the captain can not overlook it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 27]: `` I 'll tell you what , Jolliffe , '' replied Jack , `` my eyes now begin to be opened to a great many things .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 41]: The captain tells me , when I am astonished at bad language , that it is all zeal , and then I found out that what is all zeal in a superior to an inferior , is insolence when reversed .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 56]: He tells me , that the articles of war are made to equally guide us all -- the master breaks what is positively mentioned in the second article twenty times over , and goes scot free , while I am to be punished because I do not comply with what the articles do not mention .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 16]: How was I to know that I ought to go to the mast-head for punishment ?
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 16]: particularly when the captain tells me that he alone is to punish in the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 23]: If I obey an order in opposition to the captain 's order , is not that as bad as disobeying the captain ?
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 22]: I think that I have made out a very strong case , and my arguments are not to be confuted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 25]: `` I am afraid that the master will make out a very strong case , and that your arguments will never be heard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 13]: `` That will be contrary to all the rules of justice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 11]: `` But according to all the rules of service . ''
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 19]: `` I do believe that I am a great fool , '' observed Jack , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 14]: `` What do you imagine made me come to sea , Jolliffe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 19]: `` Because you did not know when you were well off , '' replied the mate , drily .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 29]: `` That 's true enough ; but my reason was , because I thought I should find that equality here that I could not find on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 3]: Jolliffe stared .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 53]: `` My dear boy , I heard you say that you obtained those opinions from your father ; I mean no disrespect to him , but he must be either mad or foolish , if at his age he has not discovered , that there is no such thing in existence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 25]: `` I begin to think so , '' replied Jack ; `` but that does not prove that there ought not to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 40]: `` I beg your pardon ; the very non-existence proves that it ought not to be -- ` whatever is , is right ' , you might as well expect to find perfect happiness or perfection in the individual .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 8]: Your father must be a visionary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 15]: `` The best thing that I can do is to go home again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 46]: `` No , my dear Easy , the best thing that you can do is , to stay in the service , for it will soon put an end to all such nonsensical ideas ; and it will make you a clever , sensible fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 49]: The service is a rough , but a good school , where everybody finds his level , -- not the level of equality , but the level which his natural talent and acquirements will rise or sink him to , in proportion as they are plus or minus .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 19]: It is a noble service , but has its imperfections , as everything in this world must have .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 35]: I have little reason to speak in its favour , as far as I am concerned , for it has been hard bread to me ; but there must be exceptions in every rule .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 16]: Do not think of quitting the service until you have given it a fair trial .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 71]: I am aware that you are an only son , and your father is a man of property , and , therefore , in the common parlance of the world , you are independent ; but , believe me , no man , however rich , is independent , unless he has a profession , and you will find no better than this , notwithstanding -- '' `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 16]: `` That you will be , most certainly , sent to the mast-head to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 25]: `` We 'll argue that point , '' replied Jack ; `` at all events , I will go and turn in to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 14]: CHAPTER XIII In which our hero begins to act and think for himself .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 18]: Whatever may have been Jack 's thoughts , at all events they did not spoil his rest .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 23]: He possessed in himself all the materials of a true philosopher , but there was a great deal of weeding still required .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 55]: Joliffe 's arguments , sensible as they were , had very little effect upon him ; for , strange to say , it is much more easy to shake a man 's opinions when he is wrong , than when he is right ; proving that we are all of a very perverse nature .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 62]: `` Well , '' thought Jack , `` if I am to go to the mast-head , I am , that 's all ; but it does not prove that my arguments are not good , only that they will not be listened to '' ; and then Jack shut his eyes , and in a few minutes was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 54]: The master had reported to the first lieutenant , and the first lieutenant to the captain , when he came on board the next morning , the conduct of Mr Easy , who was sent for in the cabin , to hear if he had anything to offer in extenuation of his offence .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 33]: Jack made an oration , which lasted more than half an hour , in which all the arguments he had brought forward to Jolliffe in the preceding chapter were entered fully into .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 25]: Mr Jolliffe was then examined , and also Mr Smallsole was interrogated : after which the captain and the first lieutenant were left alone .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 27]: `` Sawbridge , '' said Captain Wilson , `` How true it is that any deviation from what is right invariably leads us into a scrape .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 84]: I have done wrong : wishing to get this boy out of his father 's hands , and fearful that he would not join the ship , and imagining him to be by no means the shrewd fellow that he is in reality , I represented the service in a much more favourable light than I should have done ; all that he says I told him I did tell him , and it is I who really led the boy into error .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 34]: Mr Smallsole has behaved tyrannically and unjustly ; he punished the lad for no crime ; so that between the master and me , I am now on the horns of a dilemma .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 28]: If I punish the boy , I feel that I am punishing him more for my own fault and the fault of others , than his own .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 29]: If I do not punish him , I allow a flagrant and open violation of discipline to pass uncensured , which will be injurious to the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 12]: `` He must be punished , sir , '' replied Sawbridge .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 10]: `` Send for him , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 11]: Jack made his appearance , with a very polite bow .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 34]: `` Mr Easy , as you suppose that the articles of war contained all the rules and regulations of the service , I take it for granted that you have erred through ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 45]: But recollect , that although you have erred through ignorance , such a violation of discipline , if passed unnoticed , will have a very injurious effect with the men , whose obedience is enforced by the example shown to them by the officers .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 88]: I feel so convinced of your zeal , which you showed the other day in the case of Easthupp , that I am sure you will see the propriety of my proving to the men , by punishing you , that discipline must be enforced , and I shall therefore send for you on the quarter-deck , and order you to go to the mast-head in presence of the ship 's company , as it was in presence of the ship 's company that you refused . ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 13]: `` With the greatest pleasure , Captain Wilson , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 51]: `` And in future , Mr Easy , although I shall ever set my face against it , recollect that if any officer punishes you , and you imagine that you are unfairly treated , you will submit to the punishment , and then apply to me for redress . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 20]: `` Certainly , sir , '' replied Jack , `` now that I am aware of your wishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 24]: `` You will oblige me , Mr Easy , by going on the quarter-deck , and wait there till I come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 9]: Jack made his best bow , and exit .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 49]: `` Old Jolliffe told me that I should have to go , '' said Jack to himself , `` and he was right , so far ; but hang me if I had n't the best of the argument , and that 's all I care about . ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 48]: Captain Wilson sent for the master , and reprimanded him for his oppression , as it was evident that there was no ground for punishment , and he forbade him ever to mast-head another midshipman , but to report his conduct to the first lieutenant or himself .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 56]: He then proceeded to the quarter-deck , and , calling for Mr Easy , gave him what appeared to be a very severe reprimand , which Jack looked upon very quietly , because it was all zeal on the captain 's part to give it , and all zeal on his own to take it .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 10]: Our hero was then ordered up to the mast-head .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 47]: Jack took off his hat , and took three or four steps , in obedience to the order -- and then returned and made his best bow -- inquired of Captain Wilson whether he wished him to go to the fore or to the mainmast head .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 17]: `` To the main , Mr Easy , '' replied the captain , biting his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 21]: Jack ascended three spokes of the Jacob 's ladder , when he again stopped , and took off his hat .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 31]: `` I beg your pardon , Captain Wilson-you have not informed me whether it was your wish that I should go to the topmast , or the top-gallant cross-trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 14]: `` To the top-gallant cross-trees , Mr Easy , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 65]: Jack ascended , taking it very easy ; he stopped at the main-top for breath ; at the main-topmast head , to look about him ; and , at last , gained the spot agreed upon , where he seated himself , and , taking out the articles of war , commenced them again to ascertain whether he could not have strengthened his arguments .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 23]: He had not , however , read through the seventh article before the hands were turned up -- `` Up anchor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 13]: and Mr Sawbridge called , `` All hands down from aloft ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 20]: Jack took the hint , folded up his documents , and came down as leisurely as he went up .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 10]: Jack was a much better philosopher than his father .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 43]: The Harpy was soon under way , and made all sail , steering for Cape de Catte , where Captain Wilson hoped to pick up a Spanish vessel or two , on his way to Toulon to receive orders of the Admiral .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 94]: A succession of light breezes and calms rendered the passage very tedious ; but the boats were constantly out , chasing the vessels along shore , and Jack usually asked to be employed on this service ; indeed , although so short a time afloat , he was , from his age and strength , one of the most effective midshipmen , and to be trusted , provided a whim did not come into his head ; but hitherto Jack had always been under orders , and had always acquitted himself very well .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 35]: When the Harpy was at Tarragona , it so happened that there were several cases of dysentery in the ship , and Mr Asper and Mr Jolliffe were two of those who were suffering .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 62]: This reduced the number of officers ; and , at the same time , they had received information from the men of a fishing-boat , who , to obtain their own release , had given the intelligence , that a small convoy was coming down from Rosas as soon as the wind was fair , under the protection of two gun-boats .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 76]: Captain Wilson kept well off-shore until the wind changed , and then , allowing for the time that the vessels would take to run down the distance between Tarragona and Rosas , steered in the night to intercept them ; but it again fell calm , and the boats were therefore hoisted out , with directions to proceed along the shore , as it was supposed that the vessels could not now be far distant .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 59]: Mr Sawbridge had the command of the expedition in the pinnace ; the first cutter was in charge of the gunner , Mr Linus ; and , as the other officers were sick , Mr Sawbridge , who liked Jack more and more every day , at his particular request gave him the command of the second cutter .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 28]: As soon as he heard of it , Mesty declared to our hero that he would go with him ; but without permission that was not possible .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 53]: Jack obtained leave for Mesty to go in lieu of a marine ; there were many men sick of the dysentery , and Mr Sawbridge was not sorry to take an idler out of the ship instead of a working man , especially as Mesty was known to be a good hand .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 51]: It was ten o'clock at night when the boats quitted the ship ; and , as it was possible that they might not return till late the next day , one day 's biscuit and rum were put on board each , that the crews might not suffer from exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 27]: The boats pulled in-shore , and then coasted for three hours without seeing anything : the night was fine overhead , but there was no moon .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 47]: It still continued calm , and the men began to feel fatigued , when , just as they were within a mile of a low point , they perceived the convoy over the land , coming down with their sails squared , before a light breeze .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 22]: Mr Sawbridge immediately ordered the boats to lie upon their oars , awaiting their coming , and arranging for the attack .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 26]: The white lateen sails of the gun-boat in advance were now plainly distinguishable from the rest , which were all huddled together in her wake .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 27]: Down she came like a beautiful swan in the water , her sails just filled with the wind , and running about three knots an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 44]: Mr Sawbridge kept her three masts in one , that they might not be perceived , and winded the boats with their heads the same way , so that they might dash on board of her with a few strokes of the oars .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 59]: So favourable was the course of the gun-boat , that she stood right between the launch on one bow , and the two cutters on the other ; and they were not perceived until they were actually alongside ; the resistance was trifling , but some muskets and pistols had been fired , and the alarm was given .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 104]: Mr Sawbridge took possession , with the crew of the launch , and brought the vessel to the wind , as he perceived that at the alarm all the convoy had done the same , directing the cutters to board the largest vessels , and secure as many as they could , while he would do the same with the launch , as he brought them to : but the other gun-boat , which had not yet been seen , and had been forgotten , now made her appearance , and came down in a gallant manner to the support of her comrade .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 33]: Mr Sawbridge threw half his men into the launch , as she carried a heavy carronade , and sent her to assist the cutters , which had made right for the gun-boat .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 57]: A smart firing of round and grape was opened upon the boats , which continued to advance upon her ; but the officer commanding that gun-boat , finding that he had no support from his consort , and concluding that she had been captured , hauled his wind again , and stood out in the offing .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 57]: Our hero pulled after her , although he could not see the other boats ; but the breeze had freshened , and all pursuit was useless : he therefore directed his course to the convoy , and after a hard pull , contrived to get on board of a one-masted xebeque , of about fifty tons .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 82]: Mesty , who had eyes as sharp as a needle , had observed that , when the alarm was given , several of the convoy had not rounded the point , and he therefore proposed , as this vessel was very light , that they should make short tacks with her , to weather the point , as if they were escaping , and by that means be able , particularly if it fell calm again , to capture some others .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 6]: Jack thought this advice good .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 24]: The convoy who had rounded the point had all stood out to seaward with the gun-boat , and had now a fresh breeze .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 19]: To chase them was therefore useless ; and the only chance was to do as Mesty had proposed .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 39]: He therefore stood out into the breeze , and , after half an hour , tacked in-shore , and fetched well to windward of the low point ; but , finding no vessels , he stood out again .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 34]: Thus had he made three or four tacks , and had gained , perhaps , six or seven miles , when he perceived signals of recall made to leeward , enforced with guns .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 12]: `` Mr Sawbridge wants us to come back , Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 27]: `` Mr Sawbridge mind him own business , '' replied Mesty , `` we nebber take all dis trubble to ply to windward for noting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 11]: `` But , Mesty , we must obey orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 23]: `` Yes , sar , when he have him thumb upon you ; but now , must do what tink most proper .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 14]: By de powers , he catch me ` fore I go back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 9]: `` But we shall lose the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 11]: `` Find her again , by-and-bye , Massa Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 11]: `` But they will think that we are lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 23]: `` So much the better , nebba look after us , Massa Easy ; I guess we have a fine cruise anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 19]: Morrow we take large vessel -- make sail , take more , den we go to Toulon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 25]: `` But I do n't know my way to Toulon ; I know it lies up this way , and that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 9]: `` Dat enough , what you want more ?
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 15]: Massa Easy , ` pose you not find fleet , fleet soon find you .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 8]: By God , nobody nebba lost here .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 13]: Now , Massa Easy , let um go ` bout ` gain .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 12]: Somebody else burn biscuit and boil kettle to-morrow for de gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 3]: Murder Irish !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 18]: only tink , Massa Easy -- I boil kettle , and prince in my own country ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 44]: Easy was very much of a mind with Mesty ; `` for , '' argued Jack , `` if I go back now , I only bring a small vessel half-full of beans , and I shall be ashamed to show my face .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 21]: Now it is true , that they may suppose that we have been sunk by the fire of the gun-boat .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 5]: Well , what then ?
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 35]: they have a gun-boat to show for their night 's work , and it will appear that there was harder fighting than there has been , and Mr Sawbridge may benefit by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 18]: -LRB- Jack was a very knowing fellow to have leant so much about the service already . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 42]: `` Well , and when they discover that we are not lost , how glad they will be to find us , especially if we bring some prizes -- which I will do , or I 'll not go back again .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 42]: It 's not often that one gets a command before being two months at sea , and , hang me , now I 've got it if I wo n't keep it ; and Mr Smallsole may mast-head whom he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 46]: I 'm sorry for poor Gossett , though ; if Vigors supposes me dead , how he will murder the poor little fellow -- however , it is all for the good of the service , and I 'll revenge him when I come back .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 11]: Hang me if I wo n't take a cruise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 17]: `` I talk to the men , they say they all tick to you like leech .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 15]: Now dat job settled , I tink we better go ` bout again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 48]: A short time after this decision on the part of our hero , the day broke : Jack first looked to leeward , and perceived the gun-boat and convoy standing in for the shore about ten miles distant , followed by the Harpy , under all sail .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 14]: He could also perceive the captured gun-boat lying-to in-shore to prevent their escape .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 10]: `` Harpy hab um all , by Gosh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 15]: cried Mesty ; `` I ab notion dat she soon settle um hash . ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 25]: They were so busy looking at the Harpy and the convoy that , for some time , they quite forgot to look to windward .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 9]: At last Mesty turned his eyes that way .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 28]: `` Dam um , I see right last night ; look , Massa Easy -- one ship , one brig , tree lateen -- dem for us .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 12]: By de power , but we make bot prize to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 33]: The vessels found out by Mesty were not above three miles to windward ; they were under all sail , beating up for the protection of a battery , not far distant .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 60]: `` Now , Massa , suppose they see our boat , dey tink something ; keep boat alongside , and shift her when we go ` bout every time : better not sail so fast now -- keep further off till they drop anchor for de night ; and den , when it dark , we take 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 24]: All Mesty 's advice was good , with the exception perhaps of advising our hero how to disobey orders and take a cruise .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 47]: To prevent the vessel from approaching too near the others , and at the same time to let her have the appearance of doing her best , a sail was towed overboard under the bows , and after that they watched the motions of the Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 24]: The distance was too great to distinguish very clearly , but Mesty shinned up the mast of the vessel , and reported progress .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 16]: `` By Jesus , dare one gun -- two gun -- go it , Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 9]: Wo n't she ab um , sure enough .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 14]: Now gun-boat fire -- dat our gun-boat -- no , dat not ours .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 11]: Now our gun-boat fire -- dat pretty -- fire away .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 8]: Ah , now de Harpy cum up .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 5]: All ` mung 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 13]: Bung , bung , bung -- rattle de grape , by gosh .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 15]: I ab notion de Spaniard is very pretty considerable trouble just now , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 26]: All hove-to , so help me gosh -- not more firing ; Harpy take um all -- dare gun-boat hove-to , she strike um colours .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 20]: By all powers , but suppose dey link we no share prize-money -- they find it not little mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 47]: Now , my lads , it all over , and , '' continued Mesty , sliding down the mast , `` I tink you better not show yourself too much ; only two men stay on deck , and dem two take off um jackets . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 19]: Mesty 's report was correct ; the Harpy had captured the other gun-boat , and the whole convoy .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 39]: The only drawback to their good fortune was the disappearance of Mr Easy and the cutter : it was supposed that a shot from the gun-boat must have sunk her , and that the whole crew were drowned .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 75]: Captain Wilson and Mr Sawbridge seriously regretted the loss of our hero , as they thought that he would have turned out a shining character as soon as he had sown his wild oats ; so did Mr Asper , because our hero 's purse went with him ; so did Jolliffe , because he had taken an affection for him ; so did little Gossett , because he anticipated no mercy from Vigors .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 61]: On the other hand , there were some who were glad that he was gone ; and as for the ship 's company in general , they lamented the loss of the poor cutter 's crew for twenty-four hours , which , in a man-of-war , is a very long while , and then they thought no more about them .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 21]: We must leave the Harpy to make the best of her way to Toulon , and now follow our hero .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 43]: The cutter 's crew knew very well that Jack was acting contrary to orders , but anything was to them a change from the monotony of a man-of-war , and they , as well as Mesty , highly approved of a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 57]: It was , however , necessary that they should soon proceed to business , for they had but their allowance of bread and grog for one day , and in the vessel they found nothing except a few heads of garlic , for the Spaniards coasting down shore had purchased their provisions as they required them .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 42]: There were only three prisoners on board , and they had been put down in the hold among the beans ; a bag of which had been roused on deck , and a part put into the kettle to make soup .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 39]: Jack did not much admire the fare of the first day -- it was bean-soup for breakfast , bean-soup for dinner , and if you felt hungry during the intervals it was still bean-soup , and nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 23]: One of the men could speak a little Lingua Franca , and the prisoners were interrogated as to the vessels to windward .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 15]: The ship was stated to be valuable , and also one of the brigs .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 15]: The ship carried guns , and that was all that they knew about them .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 14]: As the sun went down the vessels dropped their anchors off the battery .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 21]: The breeze continued light , and the vessel which contained Jack and his fortunes was about four miles to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 24]: As for the Harpy , they had long lost sight of her , and it was now time to proceed to some arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 20]: As soon as it was dark , Jack turned his hands up , and made a very long speech .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 124]: He pointed out to the men that his zeal had induced him not to return to the ship until he had brought something with him worth having -- that they had had nothing but beans to eat during the whole day , which was anything but agreeable , and that , therefore , it was absolutely necessary that they should better their condition : that there was a large ship not four miles off , and that he intended to take her ; and as soon as he had taken her he intended to take some more ; that he trusted to their zeal to support him on this occasion , and that he expected to do a great deal during the cruise .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 72]: He pointed out to them , that they must consider themselves as on board of a man-of-war , and be guided by the articles of war , which were written for them all -- and that in case they forgot them , he had a copy in his pocket , which he would read to them to-morrow morning , as soon as they were comfortably settled on board of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 52]: He then appointed Mesty as first lieutenant ; the marine as sergeant ; the coxswain as boatswain ; two men as midshipmen to keep watch ; two others as boatswain 's mates , leaving two more for the ship 's company , who were divided into the larboard and starboard watch .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 39]: The cutter 's crew were perfectly content with Jack 's speech , and their brevet rank , and after that , they commenced a more important topic , which was , how they were to take the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 51]: After some discussion , Mesty 's advice was approved of ; which was , that they should anchor not far ahead of the ship , and wait till about two o'clock in the morning , when they would drop silently down upon her in the cutter , and take possession .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 47]: About nine o'clock the vessel was anchored as they proposed , and Jack was a little astonished to find that the ship was much larger than he had any idea of ; for , although polacca-rigged , she was nearly the same tonnage as the Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 33]: The Spanish prisoners were first tied hand and foot , and laid upon the beans , that they might give no alarm , the sails were furled and all was kept quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 54]: On board of the ship , on the contrary , there was noise and revelry ; and about half-past ten a boat was seen to leave her and pull for the shore ; after which , the noise gradually ceased , the lights one by one disappeared , and then all was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 9]: `` What do you think , Mesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 13]: said Jack ; `` do you think we shall take her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 27]: `` It is take her you mane ; sure enough we 'll take her : stop a bit -- wait till um all fast asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 21]: About twelve o'clock there came on a mizzling heavy rain , which was very favourable for our hero 's operations .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 20]: But as it promised soon to clear up , by Mesty 's advice they did not delay any longer .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 35]: They crept softly into the boat , and with two oars to steer her , dropped under the bows of the vessel , climbed up the fore chains , and found the deck empty .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 49]: `` Take care not fire pistol , '' said Mesty to the men , as they came up , putting his finger to their lips to impress them with the necessity of silence , for Mesty had been an African warrior , and knew the advantage of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 45]: All the men being on deck , and the boat made fast , Jack and Mesty led the way aft ; not a soul was to be seen : indeed , it was too dark to see anybody unless they were walking the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 30]: The companion-hatch was secured , and the gratings laid on the after-hatchways , and then they went aft to the binnacle again , where there was a light burning .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 37]: Mesty ordered two of the men to go forward to secure the hatches , and then to remain there on guard -- and then the rest of the men and our hero consulted at the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 10]: `` By the power we ab the ship ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 10]: said Mesty , `` but must manage plenty yet .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 15]: I tink der some d -- n lazy rascal sleep ` tween the guns .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 13]: A lilly while it no rain , and den we see better .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 6]: Now keep all quiet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 39]: `` There must be a great many men in this ship , '' replied our hero ; `` she is very large , and has twelve or fourteen guns -- how shall we manage to secure them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 14]: `` All right , '' replied Mesty , `` manage all dat by-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 9]: Do n't care how soon daylight come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 34]: `` It has left off raining already , '' observed Easy ; `` there is a candle in the binnacle , -- suppose we light it , and look round the decks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' replied Mesty , `` one man sentry over cabin-hatch , and another over after-hatch .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 15]: Now den we light candle , and all the rest go round the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 10]: Mind you leave all your pistols on capstern . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 34]: Jack lighted the candle , and they proceeded round the decks : they had not walked far , when , between two of the guns , they discovered a heap covered with gregos .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 20]: `` There de watch , '' whispered Mesty ; `` all fast -- not ready for dem yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 42]: Mesty blew out the candle , and they all retreated to the binnacle , where Mesty took out a coil of the ropes about the mizzen-mast , and cutting it into lengths , gave them to the other men to unlay .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 17]: In a few minutes they had prepared a great many seizings to tie the men with .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 52]: `` Now den we light candle again , and make sure of them lazy hounds , '' said Mesty ; `` very much oblige to dem all de same , they let us take de ship -- mind now , wake one at a time , and shut him mouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 13]: `` But suppose they get their mouths free and cry out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 3]: replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 41]: `` Den , Mr Easy , '' replied Mesty , changing his countenance to an expression almost demoniacal -- `` there no help for it , '' -- and Mesty showed his knife which he held in his right hand .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 4]: `` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 8]: do not let us murder them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 22]: `` No , massa -- suppose can help it , but suppose they get upper hand -- what become of us ?
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 14]: Spaniards hab knives , and use dem too , by de power ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 56]: The observation of Mesty was correct , and the expression of his countenance when he showed his knife proved what a relentless enemy he could be , if his blood was once roused -- but Mesty had figured in the Ashantee wars in former days , and after that the reader need not be surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 9]: They proceeded cautiously to where the Spaniards lay .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 8]: The arrangements of Mesty were very good .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 16]: There were two men to gag them while the others were to tie their limbs .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 33]: Mesty and Easy were to kneel by them with the candle , with raised knives to awe them into silence , or to strike home , if their own safety required it .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 36]: The gregos were removed off the first man , who opened his eyes at the sight of the candle , but the coxswain 's hand was on his mouth -- he was secured in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 27]: The other two men were awaked , and threw off their coverings , but they were also secured without there being occasion to resort to bloodshed .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 10]: `` What shall we do now , Mesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 45]: `` Now , sar , '' said Mesty , `` open the after-hatch and watch -- suppose more men come up , we make them fast ; suppose no more come up , we wait till daylight -- and see what take place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 53]: Mesty then went forward to see if the men were watchful on the forecastle ; and having again gone round the whole of the deck to see if there were any more men on it , he blew out the candle , and took his station with the others at the after-hatchway .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 71]: It was just at break of day that the Spaniards who had to keep the morning watch having woke up , as people generally do at that hour at which they expect to be called , dressed themselves and came on deck , imagining , and very truly , that those of the middle watch had fallen asleep , but little imagining that the deck was in possession of Englishmen .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 25]: Mesty and the others retreated , to allow them all to come up before they could perceive them , and fortunately this was accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 25]: Four men came on the deck , looked round them , and tried to make out in the dark where their shipmates might be .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 33]: The grating was slapped on again by Jack , and before they could well gain their eyesight , they were seized and secured , not however without a scuffle and some noise .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 41]: By the time that these men were secured and laid between the guns it was daylight , and they now perceived what a fine vessel they had fairly taken possession of -- but there was much to be done yet .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 28]: There was , of course , a number of men in the ship , and moreover they were not a mile from a battery of ten guns .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 70]: Mesty , who was foremost in everything , left four men abaft , and went forward on the forecastle , examined the cable , which was coir rope , and therefore easily divided , and then directed the two men forward to coil a hawser upon the fore-grating , the weight of which would make all safe in that quarter , and afterwards to join them on the quarter-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 24]: `` Now , Mr Easy , the great ting will be to get hold of captain ; we must get him on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 10]: Open cabin-hatch now , and keep the after-hatch fast .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 12]: Two men stay there , the others all come aft . ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 29]: `` Yes , '' replied Jack , `` It will be a great point to secure the captain -- but how are we to get him up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 10]: `` You no know how to get captain up ?
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 10]: By de holy , I know very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 28]: And Mesty took up the coils of rope about the mizzen-mast , and threw them upon deck , one after another , making all the noise possible .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 37]: In a short time , there was a violent pull of a bell at the cabin-door , and in a minute afterwards a man in his shirt came up the cabin-hatchway , who was immediately secured .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 23]: `` Dis de captain 's servant , '' said Mesty , `` he come say no make such d -- d noise .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 15]: Stop a little -- captain get in passion , and come up himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 12]: And Mesty renewed the noise with the ropes over the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 18]: Mesty was right ; in a few minutes the captain himself came up , boiling with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 37]: At the sound of the cabin-door opening , the seamen and our hero concealed themselves behind the companion-hatch , which was very high , so as to give the captain time to get fairly on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 12]: The men already secured had been covered over with the gregos .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 47]: The captain was a most powerful man , and it was with difficulty that he was pinioned , and then not without his giving the alarm , had there been anyone to assist him ; but as yet no one had turned out of his hammock .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 26]: `` Now we all right , '' said Mesty , `` and soon ab de ship ; but I must make him ` fraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 52]: The captain was seated down on the deck against one of the guns , and Mesty , putting on the look of a demon , extended above him his , long nervous arm , with the sharp knife clutched , as if ready every instant to strike it into his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 10]: The Spanish captain felt his situation anything but pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 47]: He was then interrogated as to the number of men in the ship , officers , etc , to all which questions he answered truly ; he cast his eyes at the firm and relentless countenance of Mesty , who appeared but to wait the signal .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 12]: `` I tink all pretty safe now , '' said Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 18]: `` Mr Easy , we now go down below and beat all men into the hold . ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 7]: Our hero approved of this suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 57]: Taking their pistols from the capstern , they rushed down with their cutlasses , and leaving two men to guard the cabin-door , they were soon among the crew , who were all naked in their hammocks : the resistance , although the numbers were more than double of the English , was of course trifling .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 25]: In a few minutes , the Spaniards were all thrown down into the hold of the vessel , and the hatches placed over them .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 22]: Every part of the ship was now in their possession , except the cabin , and to that they all repaired .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 63]: Our hero tried the door , and found it fast ; they beat it open , and were received with loud screams from one side of the cabin , and the discharge of two pistols from the other , fortunately without injury : those who had fired the pistols were an elderly man and a lad about the age of our hero .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 44]: They were thrown down and secured ; the cabin was searched , and nobody else found in it but three women ; one old and shrivelled , the other two , although with their countenances distorted with terror , were lovely as houris .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 33]: So thought Jack , as he took off his hat , and made them a very low bow with his usual politeness , as they crouched , half-dressed , in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 22]: He told them in English that they had nothing to fear , and begged that they would attend to their toilets .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 33]: The ladies made no reply , because , in the first place , they did not know what Jack said , and , in the next , they could not speak English .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 45]: Mesty interrupted Jack in his attentions , by pointing out that they must all go upon deck -- so Jack again took off his hat and bowed , and then followed his men , who led away the two prisoners taken in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 28]: It was now five o'clock in the morning , and there was movement on board of the other vessels , which laid not far from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 18]: `` Now , then , '' said Jack , `` what shall we do with the prisoners ?
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 25]: -- could we not send the boat and bring our own vessel alongside , and put them all in , tied as they are ?
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: We should then get rid of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 15]: `` Massa Easy , you be one very fine officer one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 28]: Dat d -- n good idea , anyhow ; -- but suppose we send our own boat , what they tink on board of de oder vessel ?
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 22]: Lower down lilly boat from stem , put in four men , and drop vessel ` longside -- dat it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 47]: This was done ; the cutter was on the seaward side of the ship , and , as the ship was the outermost vessel , was concealed from the view of the Spaniards on board of the other vessels , and in the battery on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 52]: As soon as the lateen vessel was alongside , the men who had already been secured on deck , amounting to seven , were lowered into her , and laid upon the beans in the hold ; all except the captain , the two cabin-prisoners , and the captain 's servant .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 39]: They then went down below , took off one part of the hatches , and ordered the Spaniards up from the hold : as they came on deck they were made fast and treated in the same manner .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 27]: Mesty and the men went down to examine if there were any left concealed , and finding that they were all out , returned on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 22]: The men who had been beaten down in the hold were twenty-two in number , making the whole complement of thirty .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 44]: As soon as they had all been put into the xebeque , she was again hauled off and anchored outside , and Jack found himself in possession of a fine ship of fourteen guns , with three prisoners male and three prisoners female .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 59]: When the men returned in the boat from the vessel in which the prisoners had been confined -LRB- the hatches having been secured over them , by way of further precaution -RRB- , by the advice of Mesty they put on the jackets and caps of the Spanish seamen , of which there was a plentiful supply below .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 12]: `` Now , what 's to be done , Mesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 3]: inquired Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 54]: `` Now , sar , we send some of the men aloft to get sails all ready , and while they do that I cast loose this fellow , '' pointing to the captain 's servant , `` and make him get some breakfast , for he know where to find it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 30]: `` Capital idea of yours , Mesty , for I 'm tired of bean-soup already , and I will go down and pay my respects to the ladies . ''
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 6]: Mesty looked over the counter .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 36]: `` Yes , and be quick too , Massa Easy ; d -- n the women , they toss their handkerchief in the air to people in the battery -- quick , Massa Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 25]: Mesty was right -- the Spanish girls were waving their handkerchiefs for assistance ; it was all that they could do , poor things .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 36]: Jack hastened into the cabin , laid hold of the two young ladies , very politely pulled them out of the quarter gallery , and begged that they would not give themselves so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 47]: The young ladies looked very much confused , and as they could no longer wave their handkerchiefs , they put them up to their eyes and began to weep , while the elderly lady went on her knees , and held her hands up for mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 17]: Jack raised her up , and very politely handed her to one of the cabin lockers .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 54]: In the meantime Mesty , with his gleaming knife and expressive look , had done wonders with the captain 's steward , for such the man was : and a breakfast of chocolate , salt meat , hams and sausages , white biscuit and red wine , had been spread on the quarter-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 14]: The men had come from aloft , and Jack was summoned on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 36]: Jack offered his hand to the two young ladies , and beckoned the old one to follow : the old lady did not think it advisable to refuse his courtesy , so they accompanied him .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 27]: As soon as the females came on deck , and found the two cabin prisoners bound , they ran to them and embraced them with tears .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 40]: Jack 's heart melted , and as there was now no fear , he asked Mesty for his knife , and cut loose the two Spaniards , pointing to the breakfast , and requesting that they would join them .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 48]: The Spaniards made a bow , and the ladies thanked Jack with a sweet smile ; and the captain of the vessel , who still lay pinioned against the gun , looked , as much as to say , Why the devil do n't you ask me ?
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 28]: but the fact was , they had had such trouble to secure him , that Jack did not much like the idea of letting him loose again .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 45]: Jack and the seamen commenced their breakfast , and as the ladies and prisoners did not appear inclined to eat , they ate their share and their own too ; during which , the elderly man inquired of Jack if he could speak French .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 64]: Jack , with his mouth full of sausage , replied , that he could ; and then commenced a conversation , from which Jack learnt as follows : The elderly gentleman was a passenger with the young man , who was his son , and the ladies , who were his wife and his two daughters , and they were proceeding to Tarragona .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 54]: Whereupon Jack made a bow and thanked him ; and then the gentleman , whose name was Don Cordova de Rimarosa , wished to know what Jack intended to do with them , hoping , as a gentleman , he would put them on shore with their effects , as they were non-combatants .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 16]: Jack explained all this to Mesty and the men , and then finished his sausage .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 42]: The men , who were a little elevated with the wine which they had been drinking , proposed that they should take the ladies a cruise , and Jack at first did not dislike the idea , but he said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 37]: Mesty , however , opposed this , saying , that ladies only made a row in a ship , and the coxswain sided with him , saying , that they should all be at daggers drawn .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 33]: Whereupon Jack pulled out the `` articles of war , '' and informed the men , that there was no provision in them for women , and therefore the thing was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 31]: The next question was , as to the propriety of allowing them to take their effects ; and it was agreed , at last , that they might take them .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 60]: Jack desired the steward to feed his master the captain , and then told the Spanish Don the result of the consultation , further informing him , that as soon as it was dark , he intended to put them all on board the small vessel , when they would cast loose the men and do as they pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 53]: The Don and the ladies returned thanks , and went down to pack up their baggage ; Mesty ordering two men to help them , but with a caution , that they were not to encumber themselves with any of the money , if there should happen to be any on board .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 12]: The crew were busy during the day making preparations for sailing .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 37]: The coxswain had examined the provender in the ship , and found that there was enough for at least three months , of water , wine , and provisions , independent of luxuries for the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 28]: All thoughts of taking any more of the vessels were abandoned , for their crew was but weak to manage the one which they had possession of .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 34]: A fine breeze sprang up , and they dropped their fore-topsails , just as a boat was shoving off from the shore ; but seeing the fore-topsails loosed , it put back again .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 11]: This was fortunate , or all would have been discovered .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 17]: The other vessels also loosed their sails , and the crews were heard weighing the anchors .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 17]: But the Nostra Senora del Carmen , which was Jack 's prize , did not move .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 52]: At last the sun went down , the baggage was placed in the cutter , the ladies and passengers went into the boat , thanking Jack for his kindness , who put his hand to his heart and bowed to the deck ; and the captain was lowered down after them .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 25]: Four men well armed pulled them alongside of the xebeque , put them and their trunks on deck , and returned to the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 26]: The cutter was then hoisted up , and as the anchor was too heavy to weigh , they cut the cable , and made sail .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 7]: The other vessels followed their example .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 37]: Mesty and the seamen cast longing eyes upon them , but it was of no use ; so they sailed in company for about an hour , and then Jack hauled his wind for a cruise .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 17]: CHAPTER XIV In which our hero finds that disagreeable occurrences will take place on a cruise .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 96]: As soon as the ship had been hauled to the wind , Jack 's ship 's company seemed to think that there was nothing to do except to make merry ; so they brought up some earthen jars full of wine , and emptied them so fast that they were soon fast asleep on the deck , with the exception of the man at the helm , who , instead of thirty-two , could clearly make out sixty-four points in the compass , and of course was able to steer to a much greater nicety .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 48]: Fortunately , the weather was fine , for when the man at the helm had steered till he could see no more , and requested to be released , he found that his shipmates were so overpowered with fatigue , that it was impossible to wake them .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 57]: He kicked them one by one most unmercifully in the ribs , but it was of no use : under these circumstances , he did as they did , that is , lay down with them , and in ten minutes it would have taken as much kicking to awake him as he gave his shipmates .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 36]: In the meantime the ship had it all her own way , and not knowing where she was to go , she went round and round the compass during the best part of the night .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 39]: Mesty had arranged the watches , Jack had made a speech , and the men had promised everything , but the wine had got into their heads , and memory had taken that opportunity to take a stroll .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 26]: Mesty had been down with Jack , examining the cabin , and in the captain 's state-room they had found fourteen thousand dollars in bags .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 27]: Of this they determined not to tell the men , but locked up the money and everything else of value , and took out the key .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 43]: They then sat down at the cabin table , and after some conversation , it was no matter of surprise , after having been up all the night before , that Jack laid his head on the table and fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 25]: Mesty kept his eyes open for some time , but at last his head sank down upon his chest , and he also slumbered .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 9]: Thus , about one o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 17]: There was not a very good watch kept on board of the Nostra Senora del Carmen .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 25]: About four o'clock in the morning , Mesty tumbled forward , and he hit his head against the table , which roused him up .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 41]: `` By de mass , I tink I almost fall asleep , '' cried he , and he went to the cabin window , which had been left open , and found that there was a strong breeze blowing in .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 24]: `` By de Lord , de wind ab come more aft , '' said Mesty , `` why they not tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 40]: So saying , he went on deck , where he found no one at the helm ; everyone drunk , and the ship with her yards braced up running before the wind , just by way of a change .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 46]: Mesty growled , but there was no time to lose ; the topsails only were set , -- these he lowered down , and then put the helm a-lee , and lashed it , while he went down to call our hero to his assistance .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 9]: Jack roused up , and went on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 28]: `` This nebber do , Massa Easy ; we all go to devil together -- together -- dam drunken dogs -- I freshen um up anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 26]: So Mesty drew some buckets of water , with which he soused the ship 's company , who then appeared to be recovering their senses .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 5]: `` By heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 24]: says Jack , `` but this is contrary to the articles of war ; I shall read them to them to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 28]: `` I tell what better ting , Massa Easy : we go lock up all de wine , and sarve out so much , and no more .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 14]: I go do it at once , ` fore they wake up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 12]: Mesty went down , leaving Jack on deck to his meditations .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 20]: `` I am not sure , '' thought Jack , `` that I have done a very wise thing .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 28]: Here I am with a parcel of fellows who have no respect for the articles of war , and who get as drunk as David 's sow .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 26]: I have a large ship , but I have very few hands ; and if it comes on bad weather , what shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 15]: -- for I know very little -- hardly how to take in a sail .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 71]: Then -- as for where to steer , or how to steer , I know not -- nor do any of my men ; but , however , as it was very narrow when we came into the Mediterranean through the straits , it is hardly possible to get out of them without perceiving it ; besides , I should know the rock of Gibraltar again if I saw it .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 7]: I must talk to Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 14]: Mesty soon returned with the keys of the provision-room tied to his bandana .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 18]: `` Now , '' says he , `` they not get drunk again in a hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 26]: A few more buckets of water soon brought the men to their senses : they again stood on their legs , and gradually recovered themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 59]: Daylight broke , and they found that the vessel had made an attempt for the Spanish coast , being within a mile of the beach , and facing a large battery a fleur d'eau ; fortunately they had time to square the yards , and steer the ship along shore under the topsails , before they were perceived .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 47]: Had they been seen at daylight in the position that they were in during the night , the suspicions of the Spaniards would have been awakened ; and had a boat been sent off , while they were all drunk , they must have been recaptured .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 71]: The men , who perceived what danger they had been in , listened very penitently to Jack 's remonstrances ; and our hero , to impress them more strongly on their minds , took out the articles of war , read that on drunkenness from beginning to end ; but the men had heard it read so often at the gangway , that it did not make a due impression .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 49]: As Mesty said , his plan was better , and so it proved ; for as soon as Jack had done , the men went down to get another jug of wine , and found , to their disappointment , that it was all under lock and key .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 20]: In the meantime , Jack called Mesty aft , and asked him if he knew the way to Toulon .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 9]: Mesty declared that he knew nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 65]: `` Then Mesty , it appears to me that we have a better chance of finding our way back to Gibraltar ; for you know the land was on our left side all the way coming up the Mediterranean ; and if we keep it , as it is now , on our right , we shall get back again along the coast . ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 30]: Mesty agreed with Jack that this was the ne plus ultra of navigation ; and that old Smallsole could not do better with his `` pig-yoke '' and compasses .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 31]: So they shook a reef out of the topsails , set top-gallant sails , and ran directly down the coast from point to point , keeping about five miles distant .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 35]: The men prepared a good dinner ; Mesty gave them their allowance of wine , which was just double what they had on board the Harpy -- so they soon appeared to be content .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 83]: One man , indeed , talked very big and very mutinously , swearing that if the others would join him they would soon have liquor enough ; but Mesty gave him his look , opened his knife , and swore that he would settle him , and Jack knocked him down with a handspike ; so that , what with the punishment received , and that which was promised , the fellow thought he might as well say no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 56]: The fact is , that had it not been from fear of Mesty , the whole of the men would , in all probability , have behaved equally as bad ; nevertheless , they were a little staggered , it must be owned , at seeing Jack play so good a stick with the handspike .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 43]: After this night Jack and Mesty kept watch and watch , and everything went on very well until they were nearly abreast of Carthagena , when a gale came on from the northward , and drove them out of sight of land .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 25]: Sail after sail was reduced with difficulty from their having so few hands , and the gale blew for three days with great fury .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 8]: The men were tired out and discontented .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 31]: It was Jack 's misfortune that he had but one good man with him : even the coxswain of the boat , although a fine-looking man , was worth nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 6]: Mesty was Jack 's sheet-anchor .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 58]: The fourth day the gale moderated , but they had no idea where they were : they knew that they had been blown off , but how far they could not tell , and Jack now began to discover that a cruise at sea without knowledge of navigation was a more nervous thing than he had contemplated .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 9]: However , there was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 48]: At night they wore the ships and stood on the other tack , and at daylight they perceived that they were close to some small islands , and much closer to some large rocks , against which the sea beat high , although the wind had subsided .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 12]: Again was the helm put up , and they narrowly escaped .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 32]: As soon as the sails were trimmed the men came aft and proposed that if they could find anchorage they should run into it , for they were quite tired out .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 20]: This was true , and Jack consulted with Mesty , who thought it advisable to agree to the proposal .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 10]: That the islands were not inhabited was very evident .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 13]: The only point to ascertain was , if there were good anchorage .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 52]: The coxswain offered to go in the boat and examine ; and , with four men , he set off , and in about an hour returned , stating that there was plenty of water , and that it was as smooth as a mill-pond , being land-locked on every side .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 34]: As they could not weigh the bower-anchor they bent the kedge , and running in without accident , came to in a small bay , between the islands , in seven fathoms water .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 24]: The sails were furled , and everything put in order by the seamen , who then took the boat and pulled on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 13]: `` They might as well have asked leave , '' thought Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 22]: In an hour they returned , and , after a short discussion , came aft to our hero in a body .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 5]: The coxswain was spokesman .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 111]: He said that they had had hard work , and required now to have some rest -- that there were provisions on board for three months , so that there could not be any hurry , and that they had found they could pitch a tent very well on shore , and live there for a short time ; and that , as there was no harm in getting drunk on shore , they expected that they might be allowed to take provisions and plenty of wine with them , and that the men had desired him to ask leave , because they were determined to go whether or no .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 71]: Jack was about to answer with the handspike , but perceiving that the men had all put on their cutlasses , and had their pistols at their belts , he thought proper to consult Mesty , who , perceiving that resistance was useless , advised Jack to submit , observing that the sooner all the wine was gone the better , as there would be nothing done while it lasted .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 27]: Jack , therefore , very graciously told them that they should have their own way , and he would stay there as long as they pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 21]: Mesty gave them the keys of the provision-hatch , and told them , with a grin , to help themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 36]: The men then informed Jack that he and Mesty should stay on board and take care of the ship for them , and that they would take the Spaniard on shore to cook their victuals .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 31]: But to this Jack observed that if he had not two hands he could not obey their orders , in case they wished him to come on shore for them .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 33]: The men thought there was good argument in that observation , and therefore allowed Jack to retain the Spaniard , that he might be more prompt to their call from the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 22]: They then wished him good day , and begged that he would amuse himself with the `` articles of war . ''
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 66]: As soon as they had thrown a spare sail into the boat , with some spars to make a tent , and some bedding , they went down below , hoisted up two pipes of wine out of the three , a bag or two of biscuit , arms and ammunition , and as much of the salt provisions as they thought they might require .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 14]: The boat being full , they shoved off with three cheers of derision .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 25]: Jack was sensible to the compliment : he stood at the gangway , took off his hat , and made them a polite bow .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 52]: As soon as they were gone , Mesty grinned with his sharp-filed teeth , and looking at our hero , said : `` I tink I make um pay for all dis -- stop a little ; by de piper as played before Moses , but our turn come by-and-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 14]: As for Jack , he said nothing , but he thought the more .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 50]: In about an hour the men returned in the boat : they had forgotten many things they wanted -- wood to make a fire , and several utensils ; they helped themselves freely , and having now everything that they could think of , they again went on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 31]: `` How d -- n lucky , we nebber tell dem about the dollars , '' said Mesty , as Jack and he were watching the motions of the men .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 20]: `` It is , indeed , '' replied Jack ; `` not that they could spend them here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 23]: `` No , Massa Easy , but suppose they find all that money , they take boat and go away with it .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 14]: Now , I hab them in my clutch -- stop a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 78]: A narrow piece of salt pork had been left at the gangway : Jack , without knowing why , tossed it overboard ; being almost all fat , it sank very gradually : Jack watched it as it disappeared , so did Mesty , both full of thought , when they perceived a dark object rising under it : it was a ground shark , who took it into his maw , sank down , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 6]: `` What was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 3]: said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 31]: `` That ground shark , Massa Easy -- worst shark of all ; you nebber see him till you feel him '' ; and Mesty 's eyes sparkled with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 17]: `` By de powers , they soon stop de mutiny ; now I hab 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 6]: Jack shuddered and walked away .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 30]: During the day , the men on shore were seen to work hard , and make all the preparations before they abandoned themselves to the sensual gratification of intemperance .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 55]: The tent was pitched , the fire was lighted , and all the articles taken on shore rolled up and stowed away in their places ; they were seen to sit down and dine , for they were within hail of the ship , and then one of the casks of wine was spiled .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 24]: In the meantime the Spaniard , who was a quiet lad , had prepared the dinner for Easy and his now only companion .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 67]: The evening closed , and all was noise and revelry on shore ; and as they danced , and sung , and tossed off the cans of wine by the light of the fire , as they hallooed and screamed , and became more and more intoxicated , Mesty turned to Jack with his bitter smile , and only said -- `` Stop a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 18]: At last the noise grew fainter , the fire died away , and gradually all was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 14]: Jack was still hanging over the gangway when Mesty came up to him .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 16]: The new moon had just risen , and Jack 's eyes were fixed upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 38]: `` Now , Massa Easy , please you come aft and lower down little boat ; take your pistols , and then we go on shore and bring off the cutter ; they all asleep now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 14]: `` But why should we leave them without a boat , Mesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 18]: for Jack thought of the sharks , and the probability of the men attempting to swim off .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 65]: `` I tell you , sar , this night they get drunk , to-morrow they get drunk again , but drunken men never keep quiet , -- suppose one man say to others , ` Let 's go board and kill officer , and then we do as we please , ' they all say yes , and they all come and do it .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 41]: No , sar-must have boat -- if not for your sake , I must hab it , save my own life anyhow , for they hate me and kill me first ; by de powers , stop a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 27]: Jack felt the truth of Mesty 's observation ; he went aft with him , lowered down the small boat , and they hauled it alongside .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 13]: Jack went down with Mesty into the cabin and fetched his pistols .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 16]: `` And the Spaniard , Mesty , can we leave him on board alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 34]: `` Yes , sar , he no got arms , and he see dat me have -- but suppose he find arms he never dare do anything -- I know de man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 39]: Our hero and Mesty went into the boat and shoved off , pulling gently on shore ; the men were in a state of intoxication , so as not to be able to move , much less hear .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 21]: They cast off the cutter , towed her on board , and made her fast with the other boat astern .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 18]: `` Now , sar , we may go to bed ; to-morrow morning you will see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 28]: `` They have everything they require on shore , '' replied Easy , `` all they could want with the cutter would be to molest us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 9]: `` Stop a little , '' replied Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 31]: Jack and Mesty went to bed , and as a precaution against the Spaniard , which was hardly necessary , Mesty locked the cabin door but Mesty never forgot anything .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 85]: Jack slept little that night -- had melancholy forebodings which he could not shake off ; indeed , Jack had reflected so much since he had left the ship , he had had his eyes so much opened , and had felt what a responsibility he had taken by indulging himself in a whim of the moment , that it might be almost said , that in the course of one fortnight he had at once from a boy sprung up into a man .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 14]: He was mortified and angry , but he was chiefly so with himself .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 27]: Mesty was up at daylight , and Jack soon followed him : they watched the party on shore , who had not yet left the tent .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 48]: At last , just as Jack had finished his breakfast , one or two made their appearance ; the men looked about them as if they were searching for something , and then walked down to the beach , to where the boat had been made fast .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 23]: Jack looked at Mesty , who grinned , and answered with the words so often repeated -- `` Stop a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 15]: The men then walked along the rocks until they were abreast of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 5]: `` Ship ahoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 7]: `` Halloo , '' replied Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 14]: `` Bring the boat ashore directly , with a beaker of water . ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 15]: `` I knew dat , '' cried Mesty , rubbing his hands with delight .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 11]: `` Massa Easy , you must tell them No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 13]: `` But why should I not give them water , Mesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 11]: `` Because , sar , den they take boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 8]: `` Very true , '' replied Easy .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 8]: `` Do you hear on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 35]: cried the coxswain , who was the man who hailed -- `` send the boat immediately , or we 'll cut the throats of every mother 's son of you , by God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 19]: `` I shall not send the boat , '' replied Jack , who now thought Mesty was right .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 9]: `` You wo n't -- wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 21]: -- then your doom 's sealed , '' replied the man , walking up to the tent with the other .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 28]: In a short time all the seamen turned out of the tent , bringing with them four muskets , which they had taken on shore with them .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 4]: `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 15]: they are not , surely , going to fire at us , Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 6]: `` Stop a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 27]: The men then came down abreast of the ship , and the coxswain again hailed , and asked if they would bring the boat on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 13]: `` You must say , No , sar , '' replied Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 21]: `` I feel I must , '' replied Jack ; and then he answered the coxswain , `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 46]: The plan of the mutineers had been foreseen by the wily negro -- it was to swim off to the boats which were riding astern , and to fire at him or Jack , if they attempted to haul them up alongside and defend them .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 20]: To get into the boats , especially the smaller one , from out of the water was easy enough .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 36]: Some of the men examined their priming and held the muskets at their hips all ready , with the muzzles towards the ship , while the coxswain and two men were throwing off their clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 11]: `` Stop , for God 's sake , stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 3]: cried Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 18]: `` The harbour is full of ground sharks , -- it is , upon my soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 12]: `` Do you think to frighten us with ground sharks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 44]: replied the coxswain ; `` keep under cover , my lads ; Jack , give him a shot to prove we are in earnest , and every time he or that nigger show their heads , give them another , my lads . ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 32]: `` For God 's sake , do n't attempt to swim , '' said Jack , in an agony ; `` I will try some means to give you water . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 49]: `` Too late now -- you 're doomed '' ; and the coxswain sprang off the rock into the sea , and was followed by two other men : at the same moment a musket was discharged , and the bullet whistled close to our hero 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 15]: Mesty dragged Jack from the gangway , who was nearly fainting from agonising feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 27]: He sank on the deck for a moment , and then sprang up and ran to the port to look at the men in the water .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 34]: He was just in time to see the coxswain raise himself with a loud yell out of the sea , and then disappear in a vortex , which was crimsoned with his blood .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 27]: Mesty threw down his musket in his hand , of which he had several already loaded , in case the men should have gained the boats .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 11]: `` By the powers , dat no use now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 9]: Jack had covered his face with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 66]: But the tragedy was not complete : the other men , who were in the water , had immediately turned and made for the shore ; but before they could reach it , two more of these voracious monsters , attracted by the blood of the coxswain , had flown to the spot , and there was a contention for the fragments of their bodies .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 19]: Mesty , who had seen this catastrophe , turned towards our hero , who still hid his face .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 15]: `` I 'm glad he no see dat , anyhow , '' muttered Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 5]: `` See what ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 3]: exclaimed Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 7]: `` Shark eat em all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 5]: `` Oh , horrid !
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 3]: horrid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 4]: groaned our hero .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 22]: `` Yes , sar , very horrid , '' replied Mesty , `` and dat bullet at your head very horrid .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 10]: Suppose the sharks no take them , what then ?
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 10]: They kill us and the sharks have our body .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 8]: I think that more horrid still . ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 35]: `` Mesty , '' replied Jack , seizing the negro convulsively by the arm , `` it was not the sharks -- it was I , -- I who have murdered these men . ''
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 7]: Mesty looked at Jack with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 6]: `` How dat possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 35]: `` If I had not disobeyed orders , '' replied our hero , panting for breath , `` if I had not shown them the example of disobedience , this would not have happened .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 8]: How could I expect submission from them ?
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 14]: It 's all my fault -- I see it now-and , O God !
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 11]: when will the sight be blotted from my memory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 90]: `` Massa Easy , I not understand that , '' replied Mesty : `` I think you talk foolish-might as well say , suppose Ashantee men not make war , this not happen ; for suppose Ashantee not make war , I not slave , I not run away , -- I not come board Harpy -- I not go in boat with you -- I not hinder men from getting drunk -- and dat why they make mutiny -- and the mutiny why the shark take um ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 18]: Jack made no reply , but he felt some consolation from the counter argument of the negro .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 33]: The dreadful death of the three mutineers appeared to have had a sensible effect upon their companions , who walked away from the beach with their heads down and with measured steps .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 20]: They were now seen to be perambulating the island , probably in search of that water which they required .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 27]: At noon , they returned to their tent , and soon afterwards were in a state of intoxication , hallooing and shouting as the day before .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 91]: Towards the evening they came down to the beach abreast of the ship , each with a vessel in their hands , and perceiving that they had attracted the notice of our hero and Mesty , tossed the contents of the vessels up in the air to show that they had found water , and hooting and deriding , went back , dancing , leaping , and kicking up their heels , to renew their orgies , which continued till after midnight , when they were all stupefied as before .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 29]: The next day Jack had recovered from the first shock which the catastrophe had given him , and he called Mesty into the cabin to hold a consultation .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 10]: `` Mesty , how is this to end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 7]: `` How you mean , sar ?
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 13]: -- end here , or end on board of the Harpy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 48]: `` The Harpy , -- there appears little chance of our seeing her again -- we are on a desolate island , or what is the same thing ; but we will hope that it will be so : but how is this mutiny to end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 23]: `` Massa Easy , suppose I please , I make it end very soon , but I not in a hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 14]: `` How do you mean , Mesty , not in a hurry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 59]: `` Look , Massa Easy ; you wish take a cruise , and I wish the same ting : now because mutiny you want to go back -- but by all de powers , you tink that I , a prince in my own country , feel wish to go back and boil kettle for de young gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 33]: No , Massa Easy , gib me mutiny gib me anyting -- but -- once I was prince , '' replied Mesty , lowering his voice at the last few emphatic words .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 28]: `` You must one of these days tell me your history , '' replied Jack ; `` but just now let us argue the point in question .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 11]: How could you put an end to this mutiny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 9]: `` By putting an end to all wine .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 64]: Suppose I go shore after they all drunk , I spile the casks in three or four places , and in the morning all wine gone -- den dey ab get sober , and beg pardon -- we take dem on board , put away all arms , ` cept yours and mine , and I like to see the mutiny after dat .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 13]: Blood and ` ounds -- but I settle um , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 18]: `` The idea is very good , Mesty , -- why should we not do so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 16]: `` Because I not like run de risk to go ashore -- all for what ?
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 24]: to go back , boil de kettle for all gentlemans -- I very happy here , Massa , '' replied Mesty , carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 35]: `` And I am very miserable , '' replied Jack ; `` but , however , I am completely in your power , Mesty , and I must , I suppose , submit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 12]: `` What you say , Massa Easy -- submit to me ?
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 28]: -- no sar , when you are on board Harpy as officer , you talk with me as friend , and not treat me as negro servant .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 93]: Massa Easy , I feel -- I feel what I am , '' continued Mesty , striking his bosom , `` I feel it here -- for all first time since I leave my country , I feel that I am someting ; but , Massa Easy , I love my friend as much as I hate my enemy -- and you nebber submit to me -- I too proud to allow dat , 'cause , Massa Easy -- I am a man -- and once , I was a prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 36]: Although Mesty did not perhaps explain by words half so well as he did by his countenance the full tide of feeling which was overflowing in his heart , Jack fully understood and felt it .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 69]: He extended his hand to Mesty , and said -- `` Mesty -- that you have been a prince , I care little about , although I doubt it not , because you are incapable of a lie ; but you are a man , and I respect you , nay , I love you as a friend -- and with my will we never part again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 8]: Mesty took the hand offered by Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 102]: It was the first peace offering ever extended to him since he had been torn away from his native land -- the first compliment , the first tribute , the first acknowledgment , perhaps , that he was not an inferior being ; he pressed it in silence , for he could not speak ; but could the feelings which were suffocating the negro but have been laid before sceptics , they must have acknowledged that at that moment they were all and only such as could do honour , not only to the prince , but even to the Christian .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 44]: So much was Mesty affected with what had happened , that when he dropped the hand of our hero , he went down into the cabin , finding it impossible to continue the conversation , which was not renewed until the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 8]: `` What is your opinion , Mesty ?
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 12]: Tell me , and I will be governed by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 54]: `` Den , sar , I tell you I tink it right that they first come and ask to come on board before you take them -- and , sar , I tink it also right as we are but two and they are five , dat dey first eat all their provisions .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 15]: Let 'em starve plenty , and den dey come on board tame enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 23]: `` At all events , '' replied Jack , `` the first overtures of some kind or another must come from them .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 21]: I wish I had something to do -- I do not much like this cooping up on board ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 11]: `` Massa , why you no talk with Pedro ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 9]: `` Because I can not speak Spanish . ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 13]: `` I know dat , and dat why I ask de question .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 27]: You very sorry when you meet the two pretty women in the ship , you not able to talk with them , I guess that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 13]: `` I was very sorry , I grant , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 15]: `` Well , Massa Easy , by and bye we see more Spanish girl .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 18]: Why not talk all day with Pedro , and den you able to talk with dem . ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 16]: `` Upon my word , Mesty , I never had an idea of your value .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 34]: I will learn all the Spanish that I can , '' replied Jack , who was glad to have employment found for him , and was quite disgusted with the articles of war .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 24]: As for the men on shore , they continued the same course as before , one day succeeded another , and without variety .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 40]: It was , however , to be observed that the fire was now seldomer lighted , which proved their fuel scarce , and the weather was not so warm as it had been , for it was now October .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 50]: Jack learnt Spanish from Pedro for a month , during which there was no appearance of submission on the part of the mutineers , who , for the first fortnight , when intoxicated , used to come down and fire at Jack or Mesty when they made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 44]: Fortunately drunken men are not good marksmen ; but latterly this had been discontinued , because they had expended their ammunition , and they appeared to have almost forgotten that the ship was there , for they took no notice of her whatever .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 63]: On the other hand , Jack had decided that if he waited there a year the overtures should come from them who had mutinied ; and now , having an occupation , he passed his time very quietly , and the days flew so fast that two months had actually been run off the calendar before he had an idea of it .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 36]: One evening as they were down in the cabin , for the evenings had now become very cold , Jack asked Mesty whether he had any objection to give him a history of his life .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 24]: Mesty replied that if he wished he was ready to talk , and at a nod from our hero Mesty commenced as follows .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 21]: CHAPTER XV In which mutiny , like fire , is quenched for want of fuel and no want of water .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 62]: Although we have made the African negro hitherto talk in his own mixed jargon , yet , as we consider that , in a long narration , it will be tedious to the reader , we shall now translate the narrative part into good English , merely leaving the conversation with which it may be broken , in its peculiar dialect .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 38]: `` The first thing I recollect , '' said Mesty , `` is , that I was carried on the shoulders of a man with my legs hanging down before , and holding on by his head .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 69]: `` Everyone used to look at me and get out of the way , as I rode through the town and market-place , so loaded with heavy gold ornaments that I could not bear them , and was glad when the women took them off ; but as I grew older I became proud of them , because I knew that I was the son of a king .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 4]: I lived happy .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 38]: I did nothing but shoot my arrows , and I had a little sword which I was taught to handle , and the great captains who were about my father showed me how to kill my enemies .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 60]: Sometimes I laid under the shady trees , sometimes I was with the women belonging to my father ; sometimes I was with him and played with the skulls , and repeated the names of those to whom they had belonged , for in our country , when we kill our enemies , we keep their skulls as trophies .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 62]: `` As I grew older , I did as I pleased ; I beat the women and the slaves ; I think I killed some of the latter -- I know I did one , to try whether I could strike well with my two-handed sword made of hard and heavy wood , -- but that is nothing in our country .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 48]: I longed to be a great captain , and I thought of nothing else but war and fighting , and how many skulls I should have in my possession when I had a house and wives of my own , and I was no longer a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 15]: I went out in the woods to hunt , and I stayed for weeks .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 17]: And one day I saw a panther basking in the sun , waving his graceful tail .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 31]: I crept up softly till I was behind a rock within three yards of it , and drawing my arrow to the head , I pierced him through the body .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 30]: The animal bounded up in the air , saw me , roared and made a spring , but I dropped behind the rock , and he passed over me .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 33]: He turned again to me , but I had my knife ready , and , as he fixed his talons into my shoulder and breast , I pierced him to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 25]: This was the happiest day of my life ; I had killed a panther without assistance , and I had the wounds to show .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 12]: Although I was severely hurt , I thought nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 24]: I took off the skin as my blood dropped down and mixed with that of the beast -- but I rejoiced in it .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 15]: Proudly did I go into the town dripping with gore and smarting with pain .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 14]: Everyone extolled the feat , called me a hero and a great captain .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 11]: I filed my teeth , and I became a man .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 26]: `` From that day I ranked among the warriors , and , as soon as my wounds were healed , I went out to battle .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 19]: In three fights I had gained five skulls , and when I returned they weighed me out gold .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 16]: I then had a house and wives , and my father appointed me a Caboceer .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 61]: I wore the plume of eagle and ostrich feathers , my dress was covered with fetishes , I pulled on the boots with bells , and with my bow and arrows slung on my back , my spear and blunderbuss , my knives and my double-handed sword , I led the men to battle and brought back skulls and slaves .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 38]: Everyone trembled at my name , and , if my father threatened to send me out , gold-dust covered the floor of his hall of council -- Now , I boil the kettle for the young gentlemen !
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 8]: `` There was one man I liked .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 32]: He was not a warrior , or I should have hated him , but he was brought up with me in my father 's house , and was a near relative .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 38]: I was grave and full of pride , he was gay and fond of music ; and although there was no music to me equal to the tom-tom , yet I did not always wish for excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 37]: I often was melancholy , and then I liked to lay my head in the lap of one of my wives , under the shady forest behind my house , and listen to his soft music .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 23]: At last he went to a town near us where his father lived , and as he departed I gave him gold-dust .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 40]: He had been sent to my father to be formed into a warrior , but he had no strength of body , and he had no soul ; still I loved him , because he was not like myself .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 63]: There was a girl in the town who was beautiful ; many asked for her as their wife , but her father had long promised her to my friend ; he refused even the greatest warrior of the place , who went away in wrath to the fetishman , and throwing him his gold armlets asked for a fetish against his rival .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 17]: It was given , and two days before he was to be married my friend died .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 11]: His mother came to me , and it was enough .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 59]: I put on my war dress , I seized my weapons , sat for a whole day with my skulls before me , working up my revenge , called out my men , and that night set off for the town where the warrior resided , killed two of his relatives and carried off ten of his slaves .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 43]: When he heard what I had done , he trembled and sent gold ; but I knew that he had taken the girl home as his wife , and I would not listen to the old man who sought to pacify me .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 34]: `` Again I collected a larger force and attacked him in the night : we fought , for he was prepared with his men , but after a struggle he was beaten back .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 30]: I fired his house , wasted his provision ground , and taking away more slaves , I returned home with my men , intending soon to assault him again .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 28]: The next day there came more messengers , who knelt in vain ; so they went to my father , and many warriors begged him to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 57]: My father sent for me , but I would not listen ; the warriors spoke , and I turned my back : my father was wroth and threatened , the warriors brandished their two-handed swords -- they dared to do it ; I looked over my shoulder with contempt , and I returned to my house .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 10]: I took down my skulls , and I planned .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 30]: It was evening , and I was alone , when a woman covered up to the eyes approached ; she fell down before me as she exposed her face .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 22]: `` I am the girl who was promised to your relation , and I am now the wife of your enemy .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 6]: I shall be a mother .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 13]: I could not love your relation , for he was no warrior .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 26]: It is not true that my husband asked for a fetish -- it was I who bought it , for I would not wed him .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 6]: Kill me and be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 36]: `` She was very beautiful , and I wondered not that my enemy loved her -- and she was with child -- it was his child , and she had fetished my friend to death .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 18]: I raised my sword to strike , and she did not shrink : it saved her life .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 48]: ` Thou art fit to be the mother of warriors , ' said I , as I dropped my sword , ` and thou shalt be my wife , but first his child shall be born , and I will have thy husband 's skull . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 40]: ` No , no , ' replied she , ' I will be the mother of no warriors but by my present husband , whom I love ; if you keep me as your slave I will die . '
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 46]: `` I told her she said foolish things , and sent her to the women 's apartment , with orders to be watched -- but she hardly had been locked up before she drew her knife , plunged it into her heart , and died .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 44]: `` When the king my father heard this he sent me a message -- ` Be satisfied with the blood that has been shed , it is enough ' ; but I turned away , for I wished for mine enemy 's skull .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 29]: That night I attacked him again , and met him hand to hand ; I killed him , and carried home his skull , and I was appeased .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 17]: `` But all the great warriors were wroth , and my father could not restrain them .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 26]: They called out their men , and I called out my men , and I had a large body , for my name was terrible .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 115]: But the force raised against me was twice that of mine , and I retreated to the bush -- after awhile we met and fought , and I killed many , but my men were too few , and were overpowered -- the fetish had been sent out against me , and their hearts melted ; at last I sank down with my wounds , for I bled at every pore , and I told my men who were about me to take off my feathers , and my dress and boots , that my enemies might not have my skull : they did so , and I crawled into the bush to die .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 37]: But I was not to die ; I was recovering , when I was discovered by those who steal men to sell them : I was bound , and fastened to a chain with many more .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 44]: I , a prince and a warrior , who could show the white skulls of his enemies -- I offered to procure gold , but they derided me ; they dragged me down to the coast , and sold me to the Whites .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 16]: Little did I think , in my pride , that I should be a slave .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 59]: I knew that I was to die , and hoped to die in battle : my skull would have been more prized than all the gold in the earth , and my skin would have been stuffed and hung up in a fetish-house -- instead of which , I now boil the kettle for the young gentlemen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 18]: `` Well , '' replied Jack , `` that 's better than being killed and stuffed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 33]: `` Mayhap it is , '' replied Mesty , `` I tink very different now dan I tink den -- but still , it women 's work and not suit me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 114]: `` They put me with others into a cave until the ship came , and then we were sent on board , put in irons , and down in the hold , where you could not sit upright -- I wanted to die , but could not : others died every day , but I lived -- I was landed in America , all bone , and I fetched very little money -- they laughed at me , as they bid their dollars : at last a man took me away , and I was on a plantation with hundreds more , but too ill to work , and not intending to work .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 81]: The other slaves asked me if I was a fetish man ; I said yes , and I would fetish any man that I did not like : one man laughed , and I held up my finger ; I was too weak to get up , for my blood had long boiled with fever , and I said to him ` you shall die ' ; for I meant to have killed him as soon as I was well .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 13]: `` He went away , and in three days he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 82]: I do n't know how , but all the slaves feared me , and my master feared me , for he had seen the man die , and he , although he was a white man , believed in fetish , and he wished to sell me again , but no one would buy a fetish man , so he made friends with me ; for I told him if I was beat he should die , and he believed me .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 28]: He took me into his house , and I was his chief man , and I would not let the other slaves steal and he was content .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 42]: He took me with him to New York , and there , after two years , when I had learnt English , I ran away , and got on board of an English ship -- and they told me to cook .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 62]: I left the ship as soon as I came to England , and offered myself to another , and they said they did not want a cook ; and I went to another , and they asked me if I was a good cook : everybody seemed to think that a black man must be a cook , and nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 42]: At last I starve , and I go on board a man-of-war , and here I am , after having been a warrior and a prince , cook , steward and everything else , boiling kettle for de young gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 20]: `` Well , '' replied Jack , `` at all events that is better than being a slave . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 23]: Mesty made no reply : anyone who knows the life of a midshipman 's servant will not be surprised at his silence .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 26]: `` Now , tell me , do you think you were right in being so revengeful , when you were in your own country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 3]: inquired Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 44]: `` I tink so den , Massa Easy ; sometimes when my blood boil , I tink so now -- oder time , I no know what to tink -- but when a man love very much , he hate very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 11]: `` But you are now a Christian , Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 31]: `` I hear all that your people say , '' replied the negro , `` and it make me tink -- I no longer believe in fetish , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 11]: `` Our religion tells us to love our enemies . ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 22]: `` Yes , I heard parson say dat -- but den what we do with our friends , Massa Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 6]: `` Love them too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 39]: `` I no understand dat , Massa Easy -- I love you , because you good , and treat me well -- Mr Vigors , he bully , and treat me ill -- how possible to love him ?
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 15]: By de power , I hate him , and wish I had him skull .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 9]: You tink little Massa Gossett love him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 43]: `` No , '' replied Jack , laughing , `` I 'm afraid that he would like to have his skull as well as you , Mesty -- but at all events we must try and forgive those who injure us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 53]: `` Then , Massa Easy , I tink so too -- too much revenge very bad -- it very easy to hate , but not very easy to forgive -- so I tink that if a man forgive , he hab more soul in him , he more of a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 21]: `` After all , '' thought Jack , `` Mesty is about as good a Christian as most people . ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 5]: `` What that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 13]: cried Mesty , looking out of the cabin window -- `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 13]: d -- n drunken dogs -- they set fire to tent . ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 14]: Jack looked , and perceived that the tent on shore was in flames .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 31]: `` I tink these cold nights cool their courage , anyhow , '' observed -- `` Massa Easy , you see they soon ask permission to come on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 81]: Jack thought so too , and was most anxious to be off ; for , on looking into the lockers in the state-room , he had found a chart of the Mediterranean , which he had studied very attentively -- he had found out the rock of Gibraltar , and had traced the Harpy 's course up to Cape de Catte , and thence to Tarragona -- and , after a while , had summoned Mesty to a cabinet council .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 81]: `` See , Mesty , '' said Jack , `` I begin to make it out , here is Gibraltar , and Cape de Catte , and Tarragona -- it was hereabout we were when we took the ship , and , if you recollect , we had passed Cape de Gatte two days before we were blown off from the land , so that we had gone about twelve inches , and had only four more to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 12]: `` Yes , Massa Easy , I see all dat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 81]: `` Well , then , we were blown off shore by the wind , and must of course have come down this way ; and here you see are three little islands , called Zaffarine Islands , and with no names of towns upon them , and therefore uninhabited ; and you see they lie just like the islands we are anchored among now -- we must be at the Zaffarine Islands -- and only six inches from Gibraltar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 18]: `` I see , Massa Easy , dat all right -- but six debbelish long inches . ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 31]: `` Now , Mesty , you know the compass on deck has a flourishing thing for the north point -- and here is a compass with a north point also .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 44]: Now the north point from the Zaffarine Islands leads out to the Spanish coast again , and Gibraltar lies five or six points of the compass to this side of it -- if we steer that way we shall get to Gibraltar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 29]: `` All right , Massa Easy , '' replied Mesty , and Jack was right , with the exception of the variation , which he knew nothing about .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 18]: To make sure , Jack brought one of the compasses down from deck , and compared them .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 30]: He then lifted off the glass , counted the points of the compass to the westward , and marked the corresponding one on the binnacle compass with his pen .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 36]: `` There , '' said he , `` that is the way to Gibraltar , and as soon as the mutiny is quelled , and the wind is fair , I 'll be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 16]: CHAPTER XVI In which Jack 's cruise is ended , and he regains the Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 20]: A few more days passed , and , as was expected , the mutineers could hold out no longer .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 93]: In the first place , they had put in the spile of the second cask of wine so loosely when they were tipsy that it dropped out , and all the wine ran out , so that there had been none left for three or four days ; in the next their fuel had long been expended , and they had latterly eaten their meat raw : the loss of their tent , which had been fired by their carelessness , had been followed by four days and nights of continual rain .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 23]: Everything they had had been soaked through and through , and they were worn out , shivering with cold , and starving .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 39]: Hanging they thought better than dying by inches from starvation ; and yielding to the imperious demands of hunger , they came down to the beach , abreast of the ship , and dropped down on their knees .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 42]: `` I tell you so , Massa Easy , '' said Mesty : `` d -- n rascals , they forget they come down fire musket at us every day : by all de powers , Mesty not forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 5]: `` Ship ahoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 8]: cried one of the men on shore .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 7]: `` What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 3]: replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 11]: `` Have pity on us , sir -- mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 14]: exclaimed the other men , `` we will return to our duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 6]: `` Debble doubt 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 9]: `` What shall I say , Mesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 33]: `` Tell 'em no , first , Massa Easy -- tell 'em to starve and be d -- d. '' `` I can not take mutineers on board , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 24]: `` Well , then , our blood be on your hands , Mr Easy , '' replied the first man who had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 36]: `` If we are to die , it must not be by inches -- if you will not take us , the sharks shall -- it is but a crunch , and all is over .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 8]: What do you say , my lads ?
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 37]: let 's all rush in together : good-bye , Mr Easy , I hope you 'll forgive us when we 're dead : it was all that rascal Johnson , the coxswain , who persuaded us .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 33]: Come , my lads , it 's no use thinking of it , the sooner done the better -- let us shake hands , and then make one run of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 87]: It appeared that the poor fellows had already made up their minds to do this , if our hero , persuaded by Mesty , had refused to take them on board ; they shook hands all round , and then walking a few yards from the beach , stood in a line while the man gave the signal -- one -- two -- `` Stop , '' cried Jack , who had not forgotten the dreadful scene which had already taken place -- `` stop . ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 4]: The men paused .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 13]: `` What will you promise if I take you on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 28]: `` To do our duty cheerfully till we join the ship , and then be hung as an example to all mutineers , '' replied the men .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 20]: `` Dat very fair , '' replied Mesty ; `` take dem at their word , Massa Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 22]: `` Very well , '' replied Jack , `` I accept your conditions ; and we will come for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 21]: Jack and Mesty hauled up the boat , stuck their pistols in their belts , and pulled to the shore .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 20]: The men , as they stepped in , touched their hats respectfully to our hero , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 58]: On their arrival on board , Jack read that part of the articles of war relative to mutiny , by which the men were reminded of the very satisfactory fact , `` that they were to suffer death '' ; and then made a speech which , to men who were starving , appeared to be interminable .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 42]: However , there is an end to everything in this world , and so there was to Jack 's harangue ; after which Mesty gave them some biscuit , which they devoured in thankfulness , until they could get something better .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 80]: The next morning the wind was fair , they weighed their kedge with some difficulty , and ran out of the harbour : the men appeared very contrite , worked well , but in silence , for they had no very pleasant anticipations ; but hope always remains with us ; and each of the men , although he had no doubt but that the others would be hung , hoped that he would escape with a sound flogging .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 31]: The wind , however , did not allow them to steer their course long ; before night it was contrary , and they fell off three points to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 44]: `` However , '' as Jack observed , `` at all events we shall make the Spanish coast , and then we must run down it to Gibraltar : I do n't care -- I understand navigation much better than I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 49]: The next morning they found themselves with a very light breeze , under a high cape , and , as the sun rose , they observed a large vessel in-shore , about two miles to the westward of them , and another outside , about four miles off .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 42]: Mesty took the glass and examined the one outside , which , on a sudden , had let fall all her canvas , and was now running for the shore , steering for the cape under which Jack 's vessel lay .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 6]: Mesty put down the glass .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 11]: `` Massa Easy -- I tink dat de Harpy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 21]: One of the seamen took the glass and examined her , while the others who stood by showed great agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 13]: `` Yes , it is the Harpy , '' said the seaman .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 9]: Mr Easy , will you forgive us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 14]: continued the man , and he and the others fell on their knees .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 15]: `` Do not tell all , for God 's sake , Mr Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 10]: Jack 's heart melted ; he looked at Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 34]: `` I tink , '' said Mesty , apart to our hero , `` dat with what them hab suffer already , suppose they get seven dozen a-piece , dat quite enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 44]: Jack thought that even half that punishment would suffice ; so he told the men , that although he must state what had occurred , he would not tell all , and would contrive to get them off as well as he could .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 34]: He was about to make a long speech , but a gun from the Harpy , which had now come up within range , made him defer it till a more convenient opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 15]: At the same time the vessel in-shore hoisted Spanish colours and fired a gun .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 23]: `` By de powers but we got in the middle of it , '' cried Mesty ; `` Harpy tink us Spaniard .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 16]: Now , my lads , get all gun ready , bring up powder and shot .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 28]: Massa , now us fire at Spaniard -- Harpy not fire at us -- no ab English colours on board -- dat all we must do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 41]: The men set to with a will ; the guns were all loaded , and were soon cast loose and primed , during which operations it fell calm , and the sails of all three vessels flapped against their masts .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 39]: The Harpy was then about two miles from Jack 's vessel , and the Spaniard about a mile from him , with all her boats ahead of her , towing towards him ; Mesty examined the Spanish vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 16]: `` Dat man-of-war , Massa Easy , -- what de debbel we do for colour ?
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 5]: must hoist something . ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 33]: Mesty ran down below ; he recollected that there was a very gay petticoat , which had been left by the old lady who was in the vessel when they captured her .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 28]: It was of green silk , with yellow and blue flowers , but very faded , having probably been in the Don 's family for a century .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 30]: Mesty had found it under the mattress of one of the beds , and had put it into his bag , intending probably to cut it up into waistcoats .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 21]: He soon appeared with this under his arm , made it fast to the peak halyards and hoisted it up .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 20]: `` Dere , Massa , dat do very well -- dat what you call ` all nation colour . '
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 20]: Everybody strike him flag to dat -- men nebber pull it down , '' said Mesty , `` anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 34]: Now den , ab hoist colour , we fire away -- mind you only fire one gun at a time , and point um well , den ab time to load again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 43]: `` She 's hoisted her colours , sir , '' said Sawbridge , on board of the Harpy ; `` but they do not show out clear , and it 's impossible to distinguish them ; but there 's a gun . ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 34]: `` It 's not at us , sir , '' said Gascoigne , the midshipman ; `` it 's at the Spanish vessel -- I saw the shot fall ahead of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 32]: `` It must be a privateer , '' said Captain Wilson ; `` at all events , it is very fortunate , for the corvettes would otherwise have towed into Carthagena .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 28]: Another gun , round and grape , and well pointed too ; she carries heavy metal , that craft : she must be a Maltese privateer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 41]: `` That 's as much as to say that she 's a pirate , '' replied Sawbridge ; `` I can make nothing of her colours -- they appear to me to be green -- she must be a Turk .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 15]: Another gun -- and devilish well aimed ; it has hit the boats . ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 25]: `` Yes , they are all in confusion : we will have her now , if we can only get a trifle of wind .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 10]: That is a breeze coming up in the offing .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 8]: Trim the sails , Mr Sawbridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 12]: The yards were squared , and the Harpy soon had steerage-way .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 38]: In the meantime Jack and his few men had kept up a steady , well-directed , although slow , fire with their larboard guns upon the Spanish corvette ; and two of her boats had been disabled .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 29]: The Harpy brought the breeze up with her , and was soon within range ; she steered to cut off the corvette , firing only on her bow-chasers .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 19]: `` We ab her now , '' cried Mesty ; `` fire away men , take good aim .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 10]: Breeze come now ; one man go to helm .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 7]: By de power what dat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 17]: The exclamation of Mesty was occasioned by a shot hulling the ship on the starboard side .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 26]: Jack and he ran over , and perceived that three Spanish gun-boats had just made their appearance round the point , and had attacked them .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 34]: The fact was , that on the other side of the cape was the port and town of Carthagena , and these gun-boats had been sent out to the assistance of the corvette .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 69]: The ship had now caught the breeze , fortunately for Jack , or he would probably have been taken into Carthagena ; and the corvette , finding herself cut off by both the Harpy and Jack 's vessel , as soon as the breeze came up to her , put her head the other way , and tried to escape by running westward along the coast close in-shore .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 65]: Another shot , and then another , pierced the hull of the ship , and wounded two of Jack 's men ; but as the corvette had turned , and the Harpy followed her , of course Jack did the same , and in ten minutes he was clear of the gun-boats , who did not venture to make sail and stand after him .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 33]: The wind now freshened fast , and blew out the green petticoat , but the Harpy was exchanging broadsides with the corvette , and too busy to look after Jack 's ensign .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 30]: The Spaniard defended himself well , and had the assistance of the batteries as he passed , but there was no anchorage until he had run many miles further .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 47]: About noon , the wind died away , and at one o'clock it again fell nearly calm ; but the Harpy had neared her distance , and was now within three cables ' length of her antagonist , engaging her and a battery of four guns .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 28]: Jack came up again , for he had the last of the breeze , and was about half a mile from the corvette when it fell calm .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 36]: By the advice of Mesty , he did not fire anymore , as otherwise the Harpy would not obtain so much credit , and it was evident that the fire of the Spaniard slackened fast .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 36]: At three o'clock the Spanish colours were hauled down , and the Harpy , sending a boat on board and taking possession , directed her whole fire upon the battery , which was soon silenced .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 33]: The calm continued , and the Harpy was busy enough with the prize , shifting the prisoners and refitting both vessels , which had very much suffered in the sails and rigging .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 44]: There was an occasional wonder on board the Harpy what that strange vessel might be , who had turned the corvette and enabled them to capture her , but when people are all very busy , there is not much time for surmise .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 24]: Jack 's crew , with himself , consisted but of eight , one of which was a Spaniard , and two were wounded .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 28]: It therefore left him but four , and he had also something to do , which was to assist his wounded men , and secure his guns .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 85]: Moreover , Mesty did not think it prudent to leave the vessel a mile from the Harpy with only two on board ; besides , as Jack said , he had had no dinner , and was not quite sure that he should find anything to eat when he went into the midshipmen 's berth ; he would therefore have some dinner cooked , and eat it before he went on board ; in the meantime , they would try and close with her .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 17]: Jack took things always very easy , and he said he should report himself at sunset .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 45]: There were other reasons which made Jack in no very great hurry to go on board ; he wanted to have time to consider a little , what he should say to excuse himself , and also how he should plead for the men .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 36]: His natural correctness of feeling decided him , in the first place , to tell the whole truth ; and in the next , his kind feelings determined him to tell only part of it .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 55]: Jack need not have given himself this trouble , for , as far as regarded himself , he had fourteen thousand good excuses in the bags that lay in the state-room ; and as for the men , after an action with the enemy , if they behave well , even mutiny is forgiven .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 71]: At last , Jack , who was tired with excitement and the hard work of the day , thought and thought until he fell fast asleep , and instead of waking at sunset , did not wake till two hours afterwards ; and Mesty did not call him , because he was in no hurry himself to go on board `` and boil de kettle for de young gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 46]: When Jack woke up , he was astonished to find that he had slept so long ; he went on deck ; it was dark and still calm , but he could easily perceive that the Harpy and corvette were still hove-to , repairing damages .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 26]: He ordered the men to lower down the small boat , and leaving Mesty in charge , with two oars he pulled to the Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 40]: What with wounded men , with prisoners , and boats going and coming between the vessels , everyone on board the Harpy were well employed ; and in the dark , Jack 's little boat came alongside without notice .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 20]: This should not have been the case , but it was , and there was some excuse for it .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 21]: Jack ascended the side , and pushed his way through the prisoners , who were being mustered to be victualled .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 19]: He was wrapped up in one of the gregos , and many of the prisoners wore the same .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 57]: Jack was amused at not being recognised ; he slipped down the main ladder , and had to stoop under the hammocks of the wounded men , and was about to go aft to the captain 's cabin to report himself , when he heard young Gossett crying out , and the sound of the rope .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 18]: `` Hang me , if that brute Vigors ai n't thrashing young Gossett , '' thought Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 29]: `` I dare say the poor fellow has had plenty of it since I have been away ; I 'll save him this time , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 27]: Jack , wrapped up in his grego , went to the window of the berth , looked in , and found it was as he expected .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 20]: He cried out in an angry voice , Mr Vigors , I 'll thank you to leave Gossett alone .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 62]: At the sound of the voice , Vigors turned round with his colt in his hand , saw Jack 's face at the window , and , impressed with the idea that the re-appearance was supernatural , uttered a wail and fell down in a fit -- little Gossett also , trembling in every limb , stared with his mouth open .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 8]: Jack was satisfied , and immediately disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 59]: He then went aft to the cabin , pushed by the servant , who was giving some orders from the captain to the officer on deck , and entering the cabin , where the captain was seated with two Spanish officers , took off his hat and said , -- `` Come on board , Captain Wilson . ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 22]: Captain Wilson did not fall down in a fit , but he jumped up , and upset the glass before him .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 14]: `` Merciful God , Mr Easy , where did you come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 12]: `` From that ship astern , sir , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 5]: `` That ship astern !
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 4]: what is she ?
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 9]: -- where have you been so long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 13]: `` It 's a long story , sir , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 11]: Captain Wilson extended his hand and shook Jack 's heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 36]: `` At all events , I 'm delighted to see you , boy : now sit down and tell me your story in a few words ; we will have it in detail by-and-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 126]: `` If you please , sir , '' said Jack , `` we captured that ship with the cutter the night after we went away -- I 'm not a first-rate navigator , and I was blown to the Zaffarine Islands , where I remained two months for want of hands : as soon as I procured them I made sail again -- I have lost three men by sharks , and I have two wounded in to-day 's fight -- the ship mounts twelve guns , is half laden with lead and cotton prints , has fourteen thousand dollars in the cabin , and three shot-holes right through her -- and the sooner you send some people on board of her the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 27]: This was not very intelligible , but that there were fourteen thousand dollars and that she required hands sent on board , was very satisfactorily explained .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 85]: Captain Wilson rang the bell , sent for Mr Asper , who started back at the sight of our hero -- desired him to order Mr Jolliffe to go on board with one of the cutters , send the wounded men on board , and take charge of the vessel , and then told Jack to accompany Mr Jolliffe , and to give him every information : telling him that he would hear his story to-morrow , when they were not so very busy .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 27]: CHAPTER XVII In which our hero finds out that Trigonometry is not only necessary to Navigation , but may be required in settling affairs of honour .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 79]: As Captain Wilson truly said , he was too busy even to hear Jack 's story that night , for they were anxious to have both vessels ready to make sail as soon as a breeze should spring up , for the Spaniards had vessels of war at Carthagena , which was not ten miles off , and had known the result of the action : it was therefore necessary to change their position as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 25]: Mr Sawbridge was on board the prize , which was a corvette mounting two guns more than the Harpy , and called the Cacafuogo .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 89]: She had escaped from Cadiz , run through the straits in the night , and was three miles from Carthagena when she was captured , which she certainly never would have been , but for Jack 's fortunately blundering against the cape with his armed vessel , so that Captain Wilson and Mr Sawbridge -LRB- both of whom were promoted , the first to the rank of post-captain , the second to that of commander -RRB- may be said to be indebted to Jack for their good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 17]: The Harpy had lost nineteen men , killed and wounded , and the Spanish corvette forty-seven .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 9]: Altogether , it was a very creditable affair .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 53]: At two o'clock in the morning , the vessels were ready , everything had been done that could be done in so short a time , and they stood under easy sail during the night for Gibraltar , the Nostra Signora del Carmen , under the charge of Jolliffe , keeping company .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 44]: Jolliffe had the advantage over his shipmates , of first hearing Jack 's adventures , with which he was much astonished as well as amused -- even Captain Wilson was not more happy to see Jack than was the worthy master 's mate .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 49]: About nine o'clock the Harpy hove-to , and sent a boat on board for our hero and the men who had been so long with him in the prize , and then hoisted out the pinnace to fetch on board the dollars , which were of more importance .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 106]: Jack , as he bade adieu to Jolliffe , took out of his pocket , and presented him with the articles of war , which , as they had been so useful to him , he thought Jolliffe could not do without , and then went down the side : The men were already in the boat , casting imploring looks upon Jack , to raise feelings of compassion , and Mesty took his seat by our hero in a very sulky humour , probably because he did not like the idea of having again `` to boil de kettle for de young gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 50]: Even Jack felt a little melancholy at resigning his command , and he looked back at the green petticoat , which blew out gracefully from the mast , for Jolliffe had determined that he would not haul down the colours under which Jack had fought so gallant an action .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 71]: Jack 's narration , as may be imagined , occupied a large part of the forenoon ; and although Jack did not attempt to deny that he had seen the recall signal of Mr Sawbridge , yet , as his account went on , the captain became so interested , that at the end of it he quite forgot to point out to Jack the impropriety of not obeying orders .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 19]: He gave Jack great credit for his conduct , and was also much pleased with that of Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 21]: Jack took the opportunity of stating Mesty 's aversion to his present employment , and his recommendation was graciously received .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 42]: Jack also succeeded in obtaining the pardon of the men , in consideration of their subsequent good behaviour ; but notwithstanding this promise on the part of Captain Wilson , they were ordered to be put in irons for the present .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 38]: However , Jack told Mesty , and Mesty told the men , that they would be released with a reprimand when they arrived at Gibraltar , so that all the men cared for was a fair wind .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 70]: Captain Wilson informed Jack , that after his joining the Admiral he had been sent to Malta with the prizes , and that , supposing the cutter to have been sunk , he had written to his father , acquainting him with his son 's death , at which our hero was much grieved , for he knew what sorrow it would occasion , particularly to his poor mother .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 72]: `` But , '' thought Jack , `` if she is unhappy for three months , she will be overjoyed for three more when she hears that I am alive , so it will be all square at the end of the six ; and as soon as I arrive at Gibraltar I will write , and as the wind is fair , that will be to-morrow or next day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 58]: After a long conversation Jack was graciously dismissed , Captain Wilson being satisfied from what he had heard that Jack would turn out a very good officer , and had already forgotten all about equality and the rights of man ; but there Captain Wilson was mistaken tares sown in infancy are not so soon rooted out .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 36]: Jack went on deck as soon as the captain had dismissed him , and found the captain and officers of the Spanish corvette standing aft , looking very seriously at the Nostra Signora del Carmen .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 41]: When they saw our hero , whom Captain Wilson had told them was the young officer who had barred their entrance into Carthagena , they turned their eyes upon him , not quite so graciously as they might have done .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 41]: Jack , with his usual politeness , took off his hat to the Spanish captain , and , glad to have an opportunity of sporting his Spanish , expressed the usual wish , that he might live a thousand years .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 44]: The Spanish captain , who had reason to wish that Jack had gone to the devil at least twenty-four hours before , was equally complimentary , and then begged to be informed what the colours were that Jack had hoisted during the action .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 30]: Jack replied that they were colours to which every Spanish gentleman considered it no disgrace to surrender , although always ready to engage , and frequently attempting to board .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 10]: Upon which the Spanish captain was very much puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 27]: Captain Wilson , who understood a little Spanish , then interrupted by observing -- `` By-the-bye , Mr Easy , what colours did you hoist up ?
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 7]: We could not make them out .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 13]: I see Mr Jolliffe still keeps them up at the peak . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 37]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Jack , rather puzzled what to call them , but at last he replied , `` that it was the banner of equality and the rights of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 72]: Captain Wilson frowned , and Jack , perceiving that he was displeased , then told him the whole story , whereupon Captain Wilson laughed , and Jack then also explained , in Spanish , to the officers of the corvette , who replied , `` that it was not the first time , and would not be the last , that men had got into a scrape through a petticoat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 45]: The Spanish captain complimented Jack on his Spanish , which was really very good -LRB- for in two months , with nothing else in the world to do , he had made great progress -RRB- , and asked him where he had learnt it .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 10]: Jack replied , `` At the Zaffarine Islands . ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 17]: `` Zaffarine Isles , '' replied the Spanish captain ; `` they are not inhabited . ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 9]: `` Plenty of ground-sharks , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 29]: The Spanish captain thought our hero a very strange fellow , to fight under a green silk petticoat , and to take lessons in Spanish from the ground-sharks .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 45]: However , being quite as polite as Jack , he did not contradict him , but took a huge pinch of snuff , wishing from the bottom of his heart that the ground-sharks had taken Jack before he had hoisted that confounded green petticoat .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 40]: However , Jack was in high favour with the captain , and all the ship 's company , with the exception of his four enemies -- the master , Vigors , the boatswain , and the purser 's steward .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 28]: As for Mr Vigors , he had come to his senses again , and had put his colt in his chest until Jack should take another cruise .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 36]: Little Gossett , at any insulting remark made by Vigors , pointed to the window of the berth and grinned ; and the very recollection made Vigors turn pale , and awed him into silence .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 58]: In two days they arrived at Gibraltar -- Mr Sawbridge rejoined the ship -- so did Mr Jolliffe -- they remained there a fortnight , during which Jack was permitted to be continually on shore -- Mr Asper accompanied him , and Jack drew a heavy bill to prove to his father that he was still alive .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 42]: Mr Sawbridge made our hero relate to him all his adventures , and was so pleased with the conduct of Mesty that he appointed him to a situation which was particularly suited to him , -- that of ship 's corporal .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 31]: Mr Sawbridge knew that it was an office of trust , and provided that he could find a man fit for it , he was very indifferent about his colour .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 15]: Mesty walked and strutted about at least three inches taller than he was before .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 16]: He was always clean , did his duty conscientiously , and seldom used his cane .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 50]: `` I think , Mr Easy , '' said the first lieutenant , `` that as you are so particularly fond of taking a cruise , '' -- for Jack had told the whole truth , -- `` it might be as well that you improve your navigation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 26]: `` I do think myself , sir , '' replied Jack , with great modesty , `` that I am not yet quite perfect . ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 49]: `` Well , then , Mr Jolliffe will teach you ; he is the most competent in this ship : the sooner you ask him the better , and if you learn it as fast as you have Spanish , it will not give you much trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 34]: Jack thought the advice good ; the next day he was very busy with his friend Jolliffe , and made the important discovery that two parallel lines continued to infinity would never meet .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 16]: It must not be supposed that Captain Wilson and Mr Sawbridge received their promotion instanter .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 23]: Promotion is always attended with delay , as there is a certain routine in the service which must not be departed from .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 12]: Captain Wilson had orders to return to Malta after his cruise .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 45]: He therefore carried his own despatches away from England -- from Malta the despatches had to be forwarded to Toulon to the Admiral , and then the Admiral had to send to England to the Admiralty , whose reply had to come out again .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 42]: All this , with the delays arising from vessels not sailing immediately , occupied an interval of between five and six months -- during which time there was no alteration in the officers and crew of his Majesty 's sloop Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 66]: There had , however , been one alteration ; the gunner , Mr Linus , who had charge of the first cutter in the night action in which our hero was separated from his ship , carelessly loading his musket , had found himself minus his right hand , which , upon the musket going off as he rammed down , had gone off too .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 22]: He was invalided and sent home during Jack 's absence , and another had been appointed , whose name was Tallboys .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 49]: Mr Tallboys was a stout dumpy man , with red face , and still redder hands ; he had red hair and red whiskers , and he had read a great deal -- for Mr Tallboys considered that the gunner was the most important personage in the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 30]: He had once been a captain 's clerk , and having distinguished himself very much in cutting-out service , had applied for and received his warrant as a gunner .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 48]: He had studied the `` Art of Gunnery , '' a part of which he understood , but the remainder was above his comprehension : he continued , however , to read it as before , thinking that by constant reading he should understand it at last .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 25]: He had gone through the work from the title-page to the finis at least forty times , and had just commenced it over again .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 29]: He never came on deck without the gunner 's vade mecum in his pocket , with his hand always upon it to refer to it in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 38]: But Mr Tallboys had , as we observed before , a great idea of the importance of a gunner , and , among other qualifications , he considered it absolutely necessary that he should be a navigator .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 39]: He had at least ten instances to bring forward of bloody actions , in which the captain and all the commissioned officers had been killed or wounded and the command of the ship had devolved upon the gunner .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 31]: `` Now , sir , '' would he say , `` if the gunner is no navigator , he is not fit to take charge of his Majesty 's ships .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 24]: The boatswain and carpenter are merely practical men ; but the gunner , sir , is , or ought to be , scientific .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 45]: Gunnery , sir , is a science -- we have our own disparts and our lines of sight -- our windage , and our parabolas , and projectile forces -- and our point blank , and our reduction of powder upon a graduated scale .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 35]: Now , sir , there 's no excuse for a gunner not being a navigator ; for knowing his duty as a gunner , he has the same mathematical tools to work with . ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 56]: Upon this principle , Mr Tallboys had added John Hamilton Moore to his library , and had advanced about as far into navigation as he had in gunnery , that is , to the threshold , where he stuck fast , with all his mathematical tools , which he did not know how to use .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 95]: To do him justice , he studied for two or three hours every day , and it was not his fault if he did not advance -- but his head was confused with technical terms ; he mixed all up together , and disparts , sines and cosines , parabolas , tangents , windage , seconds , lines of sight , logarithms , projectiles , and traverse sailing , quadrature , and Gunter 's scales , were all crowded together , in a brain which had not capacity to receive the rule of three .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 19]: `` Too much learning , '' said Festus to the apostle , `` hath made thee mad . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 55]: Mr Tallboys had not wit enough to go mad , but his learning lay like lead upon his brain : the more he read , the less he understood , at the same time that he became more satisfied with his supposed acquirements , and could not speak but in `` mathematical parables '' .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 43]: `` I understand , Mr Easy , '' said the gunner to him one day , after they had sailed for Malta , `` that you have entered into the science of navigation -- at your age it was high time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' replied Jack , `` I can raise a perpendicular , at all events , and box the compass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 17]: `` Yes , but you have not yet arrived at the dispart of the compass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 11]: `` Not come to that yet , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 16]: `` Are you aware that a ship sailing describes a parabola round the globe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 11]: `` Not come to that yet , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 16]: `` And that any propelled body striking against another flies off at a tangent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 23]: `` Very likely , '' replied Jack ; `` that is a ` sine ' that he do n't like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 13]: `` You have not yet entered into ` acute ' trigonometry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 11]: `` Not come to that yet , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 9]: `` That will require very sharp attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 10]: `` I should think so , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 16]: `` You will then find out how your parallels of longitude and latitude meet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 17]: `` Two parallel lines , if continued to infinity will never meet , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 11]: `` I beg your pardon , '' said the gunner .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 9]: `` I beg yours , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 32]: Whereupon Mr Tallboys brought up a small map of the world , and showed Jack that all the parallels of latitude met at a point at the top and the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 14]: `` Parallel lines never meet , '' replied Jack , producing Hamilton Moore .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 40]: Whereupon Jack and the gunner argued the point , until it was agreed to refer the case to Mr Jolliffe , who asserted , with a smile , `` That those lines were parallels , and not parallels . ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 9]: As both were right , both were satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 33]: It was fortunate that Jack would argue in this instance : had he believed all the confused assertions of the gunner , he would have been as puzzled as the gunner himself .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 26]: They never met without an argument and a reference , and as Jack was put right in the end , he only learnt the faster .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 19]: By the time that he did know something about navigation , he discovered that his antagonist knew nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 14]: Before they arrived at Malta , Jack could fudge a day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 9]: But at Malta Jack got into another scrape .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 46]: Although Mr Smallsole could not injure him , he was still Jack 's enemy ; the more so as Jack had become very popular : Vigors also submitted , planning revenge ; but the parties in this instance were the boatswain and purser 's steward .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 31]: Jack still continued his forecastle conversations with Mesty : and the boatswain and purser 's steward , probably from their respective ill-will towards our hero , had become great allies .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 27]: Mr Easthupp now put on his best jacket to walk the dog-watches with Mr Biggs , and they took every opportunity to talk at our hero .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 61]: `` It 's my peculiar hopinion , '' said Mr Easthupp , one evening , pulling at the frill of his shirt , `` that a gentleman should behave as a gentleman , and that if a gentleman professes opinions of inequality and such liberal sentiments , that he is bound as a gentleman to hact up to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 53]: `` Very true , Mr Easthupp ; he is bound to act up to them ; and not because a person , who was a gentleman as well as himself , happens not to be on the quarter-deck , to insult him because he only has perfessed opinions like his own . ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 16]: Hereupon Mr Biggs struck his rattan against the funnel , and looked at our hero .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 57]: `` Yes , '' continued the purser 's steward , `` I should like to see the fellow who would have done so on shore ; however , the time will come when I can hagain pull on my plain coat , and then the insult shall be vashed out in blood , Mr Biggs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 24]: `` And I 'll be cursed if I do n't some day teach a lesson to the blackguard who stole my trousers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 11]: `` Vas hall your money right , Mr Biggs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 6]: inquired the purser 's steward .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 12]: `` I did n't count , '' replied the boatswain magnificently .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 21]: `` No -- gentlemen are habove that , '' replied Easthupp ; `` but there are many light-fingered gentry about .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 23]: The quantity of vatches and harticles of value vich were lost ven I valked Bond Street in former times is incredible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 39]: `` I can say this , at all events , '' replied the boatswain , `` that I should be always ready to give satisfaction to any person beneath me in rank , after I had insulted him .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 26]: I do n't stand upon my rank , although I do n't talk about equality , damme -- no , nor consort with niggers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 51]: All this was too plain for our hero not to understand , so Jack walked up to the boatswain , and taking his hat off , with the utmost politeness , said to him -- `` If I mistake not , Mr Biggs , your conversation refers to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 11]: `` Very likely it does , '' replied the boatswain .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 9]: `` Listeners hear no good of themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 23]: `` It appears that gentlemen ca n't converse without being vatched , '' continued Mr Easthupp , pulling up his shirt collar .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 81]: `` It is not the first time that you have thought proper to make very offensive remarks , Mr Biggs ; and as you appear to consider yourself ill-treated in the affair of the trousers -- for I tell you at once that it was I who brought them on board -- I can only say , '' continued our hero , with a very polite bow , `` that I shall be most happy to give you satisfaction . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 15]: `` I am your superior officer , Mr Easy , '' replied the boatswain .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 43]: `` Yes , by the rules of the service ; but you just now asserted that you would waive your rank -- indeed , I dispute it on this occasion ; I am on the quarter-deck , and you are not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 25]: `` This is the gentleman whom you have insulted , Mr Easy , '' replied the boatswain , pointing to the purser 's steward .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 83]: `` Yes , Mr Heasy , quite as good a gentleman as yourself although I av ad misfortunes -- I ham of as old a family as hany in the country , '' replied Mr Easthupp , now backed by the boatswain ; `` many the year did I valk Bond Street , and I ave as good blood in my weins as you , Mr Heasy , halthough I have been misfortunate -- I 've had Admirals in my family . ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 41]: `` You have grossly insulted this gentleman , '' said Mr Biggs , in continuation ; `` and notwithstanding all your talk of equality , you are afraid to give him satisfaction -- you shelter yourself under your quarter-deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 27]: `` Mr Biggs , '' replied our hero , who was now very wroth , `` I shall go on shore directly we arrive at Malta .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 32]: Let you and this fellow put on plain clothes , and I will meet you both -- and then I 'll show you whether I am afraid to give satisfaction . ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 11]: `` One at a time , '' said the boatswain .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 26]: `` No , sir , not one at a time , but both at the same time -- I will fight both , or none .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 48]: If you are my superior officer , you must descend , '' replied Jack , with an ironical sneer , `` to meet me , or I will not descend to meet that fellow , whom I believe to have been little better than a pickpocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 22]: This accidental hit of Jack 's made the purser 's steward turn pale as a sheet , and then equally red .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 22]: He raved and foamed amazingly , although he could not meet Jack 's indignant look , who then turned round again .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 22]: `` Now , Mr Biggs , is this to be understood , or do you shelter yourself under your forecastle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 22]: `` I 'm no dodger , '' replied the boatswain , `` and we will settle the affair at Malta . ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 8]: At which reply Jack returned to Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 19]: `` Massa Easy , I look at um face , dat fellow Eastop , he no like it .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 17]: I go shore wid you , see fair play , anyhow -- suppose I can ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 37]: Mr Biggs having declared that he would fight , of course had to look out for a second , and he fixed upon Mr Tallboys , the gunner , and requested him to be his friend .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 71]: Mr Tallboys , who had been latterly very much annoyed by Jack 's victories over him in the science of navigation , and therefore felt ill-will towards him , consented ; but he was very much puzzled how to arrange that three were to fight at the same time , for he had no idea of there being two duels ; so he went to his cabin and commenced reading .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 88]: Jack , on the other hand , dared not say a word to Jolliffe on the subject ; indeed there was no one in the ship to whom he could confide but Gascoigne : he therefore went to him , and although Gascoigne thought it was excessively ` infra dig ' of Jack to meet even the boatswain , as the challenge had been given there was no retracting : he therefore consented , like all midshipmen , anticipating fun , and quite thoughtless of the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 28]: The second day after they had been anchored in Valette Harbour , the boatswain and gunner , Jack and Gascoigne , obtained permission to go on shore .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 87]: Mr Easthupp , the purser 's steward , dressed in his best blue coat , with brass buttons and velvet collar , the very one in which he had been taken up when he had been vowing and protesting that he was a gentleman , at the very time that his hand was abstracting a pocket-book , went up on the quarter-deck , and requested the same indulgence , but Mr Sawbridge refused , as he required him to return staves and hoops at the cooperage .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 14]: Mesty also , much to his mortification , was not to be spared .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 54]: This was awkward , but it was got over by proposing that the meeting should take place behind the cooperage at a certain hour , on which Mr Easthupp might slip out , and borrow a portion of the time appropriated to his duty , to heal the breach in his wounded honour .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 23]: So the parties all went on shore , and put up at one of the small inns to make the necessary arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 30]: Mr Tallboys then addressed Mr Gascoigne , taking him apart while the boatswain amused himself with a glass of grog , and our hero sat outside teasing a monkey .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 32]: `` Mr Gascoigne , '' said the gunner , `` I have been very much puzzled how this duel should be fought , but I have at last found it out .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 48]: You see that there are three parties to fight ; had there been two or four there would have been no difficulty , as the right line or square might guide us in that instance ; but we must arrange it upon the triangle in this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 11]: Gascoigne stared ; he could not imagine what was coming .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 17]: `` Are you aware , Mr Gascoigne , of the properties of an equilateral triangle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 29]: `` Yes , '' replied the midshipman , `` that it has three equal sides -- but what the devil has that to do with the duel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 33]: `` Everything , Mr Gascoigne , '' replied the gunner ; `` it has resolved the great difficulty : indeed , the duel between three can only be fought upon that principle .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 88]: You observe , '' said the gunner , taking a piece of chalk out of his pocket , and making a triangle on the table , `` in this figure we have three points , each equidistant from each other : and we have three combatants -- so that , placing one at each point , it is all fair play for the three : Mr Easy , for instance , stands here , the boatswain here , and the purser 's steward at the third corner .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 16]: Now , if the distance is fairly measured , it will be all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 21]: `` But then , '' replied Gascoigne , delighted at the idea ; `` how are they to fire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 83]: `` It certainly is not of much consequence , '' replied the gunner , `` but still , as sailors , it appears to me that they should fire with the sun ; that is , Mr Easy fires at Mr Biggs , Mr Biggs fires at Mr Easthupp , and Mr Easthupp fires at Mr Easy ; so that you perceive that each party has his shot at one , and at the same time receives the fire of another . ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 26]: Gascoigne was in ecstasies at the novelty of the proceeding , the more so as he perceived that Easy obtained every advantage by the arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 29]: `` Upon my word , Mr Tallboys , I give you great credit ; you have a profound mathematical head , and I am delighted with your arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 36]: Of course , in these affairs , the principals are bound to comply with the arrangements of the seconds , and I shall insist upon Mr Easy consenting to your excellent and scientific proposal . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 26]: Gascoigne went out , and pulling Jack away from the monkey , told him what the gunner had proposed , at which Jack laughed heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 40]: The gunner also explained it to the boatswain , who did not very well comprehend , but replied -- `` I dare say it 's all right -- shot for shot , and d -- n all favours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 44]: The parties then repaired to the spot with two pairs of ship 's pistols , which Mr Tallboys had smuggled on shore ; and , as soon as they were on the ground , the gunner called Mr Easthupp out of the cooperage .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 20]: In the meantime , Gascoigne had been measuring an equilateral triangle of twelve paces -- and marked it out .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 38]: Mr Tallboys , on his return with the purser 's steward , went over the ground , and finding that it was `` equal angles subtended by equal sides , '' declared that it was all right .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 33]: Easy took his station , the boatswain was put into his , and Mr Easthupp , who was quite in a mystery , was led by the gunner to the third position .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 20]: `` But , Mr Tallboys , '' said the purser 's steward , `` I do n't understand this .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 13]: Mr Easy will first fight Mr Biggs , will he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 16]: `` No , '' replied the gunner , `` this is a duel of three .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 23]: You will fire at Mr Easy , Mr Easy will fire at Mr Biggs , and Mr Biggs will fire at you .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 9]: It is all arranged , Mr Easthupp . ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 15]: `` But , '' said Mr Easthupp , `` I do not understand it .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 9]: Why is Mr Biggs to fire at me ?
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 9]: I have no quarrel with Mr Biggs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 20]: `` Because Mr Easy fires at Mr Biggs , and Mr Biggs must have his shot as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 28]: `` If you have ever been in the company of gentlemen , Mr Easthupp , '' observed Gascoigne , `` you must know something about duelling . ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 58]: `` Yes , yes , I 've kept the best company , Mr Gascoigne , and I can give a gentleman satisfaction ; but -- '' `` Then , sir , if that is the case , you must know that your honour is in the hands of your second , and that no gentleman appeals . ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 38]: `` Yes , yes , I know that , Mr Gascoigne ; but still I 've no quarrel with Mr Biggs , and therefore , Mr Biggs , of course you will not aim at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 35]: `` Why you do n't think that I am going to be fired at for nothing , '' replied the boatswain ; `` no , no , I 'll have my shot anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 10]: `` But at your friend , Mr Biggs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 21]: `` All the same , I shall fire at somebody ; shot for shot , and hit the luckiest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 38]: `` Vel , gentlemen , I purtest against these proceedings , '' replied Mr Easthupp ; `` I came here to have satisfaction from Mr Easy , and not to be fired at by Mr Biggs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 14]: `` Do n't you have satisfaction when you fire at Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 12]: replied the gunner ; `` what more would you have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 11]: `` I purtest against Mr Biggs firing at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 38]: `` So you would have a shot without receiving one , '' cried Gascoigne : `` the fact is that this fellow 's a confounded coward , and ought to be kicked into the cooperage again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 16]: At this affront Mr Easthupp rallied , and accepted the pistol offered by the gunner .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 17]: `` You ear those words , Mr Biggs ; pretty language to use to a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 17]: You shall ear from me , sir , as soon as the ship is paid off .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 12]: I purtest no longer , Mr Tallboys ; death before dishonour .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 8]: I 'm a gentleman , damme ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 24]: At all events , the swell was not a very courageous gentleman , for he trembled most exceedingly as he pointed his pistol .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 18]: The gunner gave the word , as if he were exercising the great guns on board ship .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 6]: `` Cock your locks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 10]: -- `` Take good aim at the object ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 5]: -- `` Fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 7]: -- `` Stop your vents ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 68]: The only one of the combatants who appeared to comply with the latter supplementary order was Mr Easthupp , who clapped his hand to his trousers behind , gave a loud yell , and then dropped down ; the bullet having passed clean through his seat of honour , from his having presented his broadside as a target to the boatswain as he faced towards our hero .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 47]: Jack 's shot had also taken effect , having passed through both the boatswain 's cheeks , without further mischief than extracting two of his best upper double teeth , and forcing through the hole of the further cheek the boatswain 's own quid of tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 29]: As for Mr Easthupp 's ball , as he was very unsettled , and shut his eyes before he fired , it had gone the Lord knows where .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 36]: The purser 's steward lay on the ground and screamed -- the boatswain spit his double teeth and two or three mouthfuls of blood out , and then threw down his pistols in a rage .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 20]: `` A pretty business , by God , '' sputtered he ; `` he 's put my pipe out .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 23]: How the devil am I to pipe to dinner when I 'm ordered , all my wind escaping through the cheeks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 22]: In the meantime , the others had gone to the assistance of the purser 's steward , who continued his vociferations .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 16]: They examined him , and considered a wound in that part not to be dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 27]: `` Hold your confounded bawling , '' cried the gunner , `` or you 'll have the guard down here : you 're not hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 6]: `` Ha n't hi ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 21]: roared the steward : `` Oh , let me die , let me die ; do n't move me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 36]: `` Nonsense , '' cried the gunner , `` you must get up and walk down to the boat ; if you do n't we 'll leave you -- hold your tongue , confound you .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 4]: You wo n't ?
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 11]: then I 'll give you something to halloo for . ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 35]: Whereupon Mr Tallboys commenced cuffing the poor wretch right and left , who received so many swinging boxes of the ear that he was soon reduced to merely pitiful plaints of `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 10]: -- such inhumanity -- I purtest -- oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 5]: must I get up ?
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 7]: I ca n't , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 48]: `` I do not think he can move , Mr Tallboys , '' said Gascoigne ; `` I should think the best plan would be to call up two of the men from the cooperage , and let them take him at once to the hospital . ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 12]: The gunner went down to the cooperage to call the men .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 32]: Mr Biggs , who had bound up his face as if he had a toothache , for the bleeding had been very slight , came up to the purser 's steward .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 12]: `` What the hell are you making such a howling about ?
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 72]: Look at me , with two shot-holes through my figure head , while you have only got one in your stem : I wish I could change with you , by heavens , for I could use my whistle then -- now if I attempt to pipe , there will be such a wasteful expenditure of his Majesty 's stores of wind , that I never shall get out a note .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 10]: A wicked shot of yours , Mr Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 27]: `` I really am very sorry , '' replied Jack , with a polite bow , `` and I beg to offer my best apology . ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 20]: During this conversation , the purser 's steward felt very faint , and thought he was going to die .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 4]: `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 3]: oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 37]: what a fool I was ; I never was a gentleman -- only a swell : I shall die ; I never will pick a pocket again -- never -- never -- God forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 22]: `` Why , confound the fellow , '' cried Gascoigne , `` so you were a pickpocket , were you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 15]: `` I never will again , '' replied the fellow in a faint voice .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 17]: `` Hi 'll hamend and lead a good life -- a drop of water -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 5]: lagged at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 55]: Then the poor wretch fainted away : and Mr Tallboys coming up with the men , he was taken on their shoulders and walked off to the hospital , attended by the gunner and also the boatswain , who thought he might as well have a little medical advice before he went on board .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 40]: `` Well , Easy , '' said Gascoigne , collecting the pistols and tying them up in his handkerchief , `` I 'll be shot but we 're in a pretty scrape ; there 's no hushing this up .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 21]: I 'll be hanged if I care , it 's the best piece of fun I ever met with . ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 16]: And at the remembrance of it Gascoigne laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 27]: Jack 's mirth was not quite so excessive , as he was afraid that the purser 's steward was severely hurt , and expressed his fears .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 41]: `` At all events , you did not hit him , '' replied Gascoigne : `` all you have to answer for is the boatswain 's mug , -- I think you 've stopped his jaw for the future . ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 18]: `` I 'm afraid that our leave will be stopped for the future , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 13]: `` That we may take our oaths of , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 47]: `` Then look you , Ned , '' said Easy ; `` I 've lots of dollars -- we may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb , as the saying is , I vote that we do not go on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 21]: `` Sawbridge will send and fetch us , '' replied Ned ; `` but he must find us first . ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 20]: `` That wo n't take long , for the soldiers will soon have our description and rout us out .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 11]: We shall be pinned in a couple of days . ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 55]: `` Confound it , and they say that the ship is to be hove down , and that we shall be here six weeks at least , cooped up on board in a broiling sun , and nothing to do but to watch the pilot fish playing round the rudder and munch bad apricots .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 7]: I wo n't go on board .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 18]: Look ` ye , Jack , '' said Gascoigne , `` have you plenty of money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 13]: `` I have twenty doubloons , besides dollars , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 31]: `` Well , then , we will pretend to be so much alarmed at the result of this duel that we dare not show ourselves lest we should be hung .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 37]: I will write a note and send it to Jolliffe , to say that we have hid ourselves until the affair is blown over , and beg him to intercede with the captain and first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 36]: I will tell him all the particulars , and refer to the gunner for the truth of it ; and then I know that , although we should be punished , they will only laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 18]: But I will pretend that Easthupp is killed , and we are frightened out of our lives .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 54]: That will be it , and then let 's get on board one of the speronares which come with fruit from Sicily , sail in the night for Palermo , and then we 'll have a cruise for a fortnight , and when the money is all gone we 'll come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 18]: `` That 's a capital idea , Ned , and the sooner we do it the better .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 38]: I will write to the captain , begging him to get me off from being hung , and telling him where we have fled to , and that letter shall be given after we have sailed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 12]: They were two very nice lads -- our hero and Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 21]: CHAPTER XVIII In which our hero sets off on another cruise , in which he is not blown off shore .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 30]: Gascoigne and our hero were neither of them in uniform , and they hastened to Nix Mangare stairs , where they soon picked up the padrone of a speronare .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 78]: They went with him into a wine shop , and with the assistance of a little English from a Maltese boy , whose shirt hung out of his trousers , they made a bargain , by which it was agreed that , for the consideration of two doubloons , he would sail that evening and land them at Gergentif or some other town in Sicily , providing them with something to eat and gregos to sleep upon .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 55]: Our two midshipmen then went back to the tavern from which they had set off to fight the duel , and ordering a good dinner to be served in a back room , they amused themselves with killing flies , as they talked over the events of the day and waited for their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 47]: As Mr Tallboys did not himself think proper to go on board till the evening , and Mr Biggs also wished it to be dark before he went up the ship 's side , the events of the duel did not transpire till the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 44]: Even then it was not known from the boatswain or gunner , but by a hospital mate coming on board to inform the surgeon that there was one of their men wounded under their charge , but that he was doing very well .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 12]: Mr Biggs had ascended the side with his face bound up .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 24]: `` Confound that Jack Easy , '' said he , `` I have only been on leave twice since I sailed from Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 41]: Once I was obliged to come up the side without my trousers , and show my bare stem to the whole ship 's company , and now I am coming up , and dare not show my figure head . ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 45]: He reported himself to the officer of the watch , and hastening to his cabin went to bed and lay the whole night awake from pain , thinking what excuse he could possibly make for not coming on deck next morning to his duty .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 32]: He was , however , saved this trouble , for Mr Jolliffe brought the letter of Gascoigne up to Mr Sawbridge , and the captain had received that of our hero .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 59]: Captain Wilson came on board and found that Mr Sawbridge could communicate all the particulars of which he had not been acquainted by Jack ; and after they had read over Gascoigne 's letter in the cabin , and interrogated Mr Tallboys , who was sent down under an arrest , they gave free vent to their mirth .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 20]: `` Upon my soul , there 's no end to Mr Easy 's adventures , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 27]: `` I could laugh at the duel , for after all it is nothing -- and he would have been let off with a severe reprimand .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 26]: But the foolish boys have set off in a speronare to Sicily , and how the devil are we to get them back again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 21]: `` They 'll come back , sir , '' replied Sawbridge , `` when all their money 's gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 13]: `` Yes , if they do not get into any more scrapes .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 23]: That young scamp Gascoigne is as bad as Easy , and now they are together there 's no saying what may happen .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 26]: I dine at the Governor 's to-day ; how he will laugh when I tell him of this new way of fighting a duel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 17]: `` Yes , sir , it is just the thing that will tickle old Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 23]: `` We must find out if they have got off the island , Sawbridge , which may not be the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 6]: But it was the case .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 33]: Jack and Gascoigne had eaten a ye good dinner , sent for the monkey to amuse them till it was dark , and there had waited till the padrone came to them .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 12]: `` What shall we do with the pistols , Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 18]: `` Take them with us , and load them before we go -- we may want them .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 14]: Who knows but there may be a mutiny on board of the speronare ?
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 9]: I wish we had Mesty with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 40]: They loaded the pistols , took a pair each and put them in their waists , concealed under their clothes , divided the ammunition between them , and soon afterwards the padrone came to tell them all was ready .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 35]: Whereupon Messrs Gascoigne and Easy paid there bill and rose to depart , but the padrone informed them that he should like to see the colour of their money before they went on board .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 36]: Jack , very indignant at the insinuation that he had not sufficient cash , pulled out a handful of doubloons , and tossing two to the padrone , and asked him if he was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 64]: The padrone untied his sash , put in the money , and with many thanks and protestations of service , begged our young gentlemen to accompany him ; they did so , and in a few minutes were clear of Nix Mangare stairs , and , passing close to his Majesty 's ship Harpy , were soon out of the harbour of Valette .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 50]: Of all the varieties of vessels which float upon the wave , there is not , perhaps , one that bounds over the water so gracefully or so lightly as a speronare , or any one so picturesque and beautiful to the eye of those who watch its progress .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 38]: The night was clear , and the stars shone out brilliantly as the light craft skimmed over the water , and a fragment of a desert and waning moon threw its soft beams upon the snow-white sail .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 38]: The vessel , which had no deck , was full of baskets , which had contained grapes and various fruits brought from the ancient granary , of Rome , still as fertile and as luxuriant as ever .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 67]: The crew consisted of the padrone , two men and a boy ; the three latter , with their gregos , or night great-coats with hoods , sitting forward before the sail , with their eyes fixed on the land as they flew past point after point , thinking perhaps of their wives , or perhaps of their sweethearts , or perhaps not thinking at all .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 25]: The padrone remained aft at the helm , offering every politeness to our two young gentlemen , who only wished to be left alone .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 23]: At last they requested the padrone to give them gregos to lie down upon , as they wished to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 20]: He called the boy to take the helm , procured them all they required , and then went forward .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 21]: And our two midshipmen laid down looking at the stars above them for some minutes , without exchanging a word .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 19]: At last Jack commenced -- `` I have been thinking , Gascoigne , that this is very delightful .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 24]: My heart bounds with the vessel , and it almost appears to me as if the vessel herself was rejoicing in her liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 21]: Here she is capering over the waves instead of being tied by the nose with a cable and anchor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 48]: `` That 's a touch of the sentimental , Jack , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` but she is no more free than she was when at anchor , for she now is forced to act in obedience to her steersman and go just where he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 32]: You may just as well say that a horse , if taken out of the stable , is free , with the curb , and his rider on his back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 16]: `` That 's a touch of the rational , Ned , which destroys the illusion .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 11]: Never mind , we are free , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 10]: What machines we are on board of a man-of-war !
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 44]: we walk , talk , eat , drink , sleep , and get up , just like clock-work ; we are wound up to go the twenty-four hours , and then wound up again ; just like old Smallsole does the chronometers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 34]: `` Very true , Jack ; but it does not appear to me , that hitherto you have kept very good time ; you require a little more regulating , '' said Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 23]: `` How can you expect any piece of machinery to go well , so damnably knocked about as a midshipman is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 4]: replied our hero .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 23]: `` Very true , Jack ; but sometimes you do n't keep any time , for you do n't keep any watch .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 8]: Mr Asper do n't wind you up .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 8]: You do n't go at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 20]: `` No ; because he allows me to go down ; but still I do go , Ned . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 23]: `` Yes , to your hammock -- it 's no go with old Smallsole , if I want a bit of caulk .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 16]: But , Jack , what do you say -- shall we keep watch to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 32]: `` Why , to tell you the truth , I have been thinking the same thing -- I do n't much like the looks of the padrone -- he squints . ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 73]: `` That 's no proof of anything , Jack , except that his eyes are not straight : but if you do not like the look of him , I can tell you that he very much liked the look of your doubloons -- I saw him start , and his eyes twinkled , and I thought at the time it was a pity you had not paid him in dollars . ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 18]: `` It was very foolish in me , but at all events he has not seen all .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 8]: He saw quite enough , Ned . ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 24]: `` Very true , but you should have let him see the pistols , and not have let him see the doubloons . ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 32]: `` Well , if he wishes to take what he has seen , he shall receive what he has not seen -- why , there are only four of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 24]: `` Oh , I have no fear of them , only it may be as well to sleep with one eye open . ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 9]: `` When shall we make the land ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 14]: `` To-morrow evening with this wind , and it appears to be steady .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 30]: Suppose we keep watch and watch , and have our pistols out ready , with the great-coats just turned over them , to keep them out of sight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 18]: `` Agreed -- it 's about twelve o'clock now -- who shall keep the middle watch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 12]: `` I will , Jack , if you like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 17]: `` Well , then , mind you kick me hard , for I sleep devilish sound .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 9]: Good-night , and keep a sharp look-out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 34]: Jack was fast asleep in less than ten minutes ; and Gascoigne , with his pistols lying by him all ready for each hand , sat up at the bottom of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 37]: There certainly is a peculiar providence in favour of midshipmen compared with the rest of mankind ; they have more lives than a cat -- always in the greatest danger , but always escaping from it .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 32]: The padrone of the vessel had been captivated with the doubloons which Jack had so foolishly exposed to his view , and he had , moreover , resolved to obtain them .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 42]: At the very time that our two lads were conversing aft , the padrone was talking the matter over with his two men forward , and it was agreed that they should murder , rifle , and then throw them overboard .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 23]: About two o'clock in the morning , the padrone came aft to see if they were asleep , but found Gascoigne watching .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 16]: He returned aft again and again , but found the young man still sitting up .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 30]: Tired of waiting , anxious to possess the money , and not supposing that the lads were armed , he went once more forward and spoke to the men .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 38]: Gascoigne had watched his motions ; he thought it singular that , with three men in the vessel , the helm should be confided to the boy -- and at last he saw them draw their knives .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 9]: He pushed our hero , who woke immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 21]: Gascoigne put his hand over Jack 's mouth , that he might not speak , and then whispered his suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 36]: Jack seized his pistols -- they both cocked them without noise , and then waited in silence , Jack still lying down , while Gascoigne continued to sit up at the bottom of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 55]: At last Gascoigne saw the three men coming aft -- he dropped one of his pistols for a second to give Jack a squeeze of the hand , which was returned , and as Gascoigne watched them making their way through the piles of empty baskets he leaned back as if he was slumbering .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 120]: The padrone , followed by the two men , was at last aft , -- they paused a moment before they stepped over the strengthening plank , which ran from side to side of the boat between them and the midshipmen , and as neither of them stirred , they imagined that both were asleep -- advanced and raised their knives , when Gascoigne and Jack , almost at the same moment , each discharged their pistols into the breast of the padrone and one of the men , who was with him in advance , who both fell with the send aft of the boat , so as to encumber the midshipmen with the weight of their bodies .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 6]: The third man started back .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 30]: Jack , who could not rise , from the padrone lying across his legs , took a steady aim with his second pistol , and the third man fell .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 94]: The boy at the helm , who , it appeared , either was aware of what was to be done , or seeing the men advance with their knives , had acted upon what he saw , also drew his knife and struck at Gascoigne from behind ; the knife fortunately , after slightly wounding Gascoigne on the shoulder , had shut on the boy 's hand -- Gascoigne sprang up with his other pistol -- the boy started back at the sight of it , lost his balance , and fell overboard .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 10]: Our two midshipmen took a few seconds to breathe .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 28]: `` I say , Jack , '' said Gascoigne at last , `` did you ever -- '' `` No , I never -- '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 9]: `` What 's to be done now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 31]: `` Why , as we 've got possession , Ned , we had better put a man at the helm-for the speronare is having it all her own way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 26]: `` Very true , '' replied Gascoigne , `` and as I can steer better than you , I suppose it must be me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 21]: Gascoigne went to the helm , brought the boat up to the wind , and then they resumed their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 44]: `` That rascal of a boy gave me a devil of a lick on the shoulder ; I do n't know whether he has hurt me -- at all events it 's my left shoulder , so I can steer just as well .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 9]: I wonder whether the fellows are dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 13]: `` The padrone is , at all events , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 41]: `` It was as much as I could do to get my legs from under him -- but we 'll wait till daylight before we see to that -- in the meantime , I 'll load the pistols again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 18]: `` The day is breaking now -- it will be light in half an hour or less .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 10]: What a devil of a spree , Jack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 10]: `` Yes , but how can one help it ?
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 21]: We ran away because two men are wounded -- and now we are obliged to kill four in self-defence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 23]: `` Yes , but that is not the end of it ; when we get to Sicily what are we to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 12]: we shall be imprisoned by the authorities -- perhaps hung . ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 13]: `` We 'll argue that point with them , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 28]: `` We had better argue the point between ourselves , Jack , and see what will be the best plan to get out of our scrape . ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 23]: `` I think that we just have got out of it -- never fear but we 'll get out of the next .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 30]: Do you know , Gascoigne , it appears to me very odd , but I can do nothing but there 's a bobbery at the bottom of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 12]: `` You certainly have a great talent that way , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 12]: Do n't I hear one of those poor fellows groan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 9]: `` I should think that not impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 9]: `` What shall we do with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 23]: `` We will argue that point , Ned -- we must either keep their bodies , or we must throw them overboard .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 13]: Either tell the whole story , or say nothing about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 21]: `` That 's very evident ; in short , we must do something , for your argument goes no further .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 12]: But now let us take up one of your propositions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 33]: `` Well , then , suppose we keep the bodies on board , run into a seaport , go to the authorities , and state all the facts , what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 35]: `` We shall prove , beyond all doubt , that we have killed three men , if not four ; but we shall not prove that we were obliged so to do , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 59]: And then we are heretics -- we shall be put in prison till they are satisfied of our innocence , which we never can prove , and there we shall remain until we have written to Malta , and a man-of-war comes to redeem us , if we are not stabbed or something else in the meantime . ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 14]: `` That will not be a very pleasant cruise , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 13]: `` Now let 's argue the point on the other side . ''
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 32]: `` There is some difficulty there -- suppose we throw their bodies overboard , toss the baskets after them , wash the boat clean , and make for the first port .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 45]: We may chance to hit upon the very spot from which they sailed , and then there will be a pack of wives and children , and a populace with knives , asking us what has become of the men of the boat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 15]: `` I do n't much like the idea of that , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 31]: `` And if we do n't have such bad luck , still we shall be interrogated as to who we are , and how we were adrift by ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 29]: `` There will be a difficulty about that again -- we must swear that it is a party of pleasure , and that we are gentlemen yachting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 39]: `` Without a crew or provisions -- yachts do n't sail with a clean swept hold , or gentlemen without a spare shirt -- we have nothing but two gallons of water and two pairs of pistols . ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 48]: `` I have it , '' said Jack -- `` we are two young gentlemen in our own boat who went out to Gozo with pistols to shoot sea-mews , were caught in a gale , and blown down to Sicily -- that will excite interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 20]: `` That 's the best idea yet , as it will account for our having nothing in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 38]: Well , then , at all events , we will get rid of the bodies ; but suppose they are not dead -- we can not throw them overboard alive , -- that will be murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 23]: `` Very true , '' replied Jack , `` then we must shoot them first , and toss them overboard afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 45]: `` Upon my soul , Easy , you are an odd fellow : however , go and examine the men , and we 'll decide that point by-and-bye : you had better keep your pistol ready cocked , for they may be shamming . ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 40]: `` Devil a bit of sham here , anyhow , '' replied Jack , pulling at the body of the padrone , `` and as for this fellow you shot , you might put your fist into his chest .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 23]: Now for the third , '' continued Jack , stepping over the strengthening piece -- `` he 's all among the baskets .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 11]: I say , my cock , are you dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 12]: and Jack enforced his question with a kick in the ribs .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 4]: The man groaned .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 24]: `` That 's unlucky , Gascoigne , but however , I 'll soon settle him , '' said Jack , pointing his pistol .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 17]: `` Stop , Jack , '' cried Gascoigne , `` it really will be murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 29]: `` No such thing , Ned ; I 'll just blow his brains out , and then I 'll come aft and argue the point with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 14]: `` Now do oblige me by coming aft and arguing the point first .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 14]: Do , Jack , I beg of you -- I entreat you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 29]: `` With all my heart , '' replied Jack , resuming his seat by Gascoigne ; `` I assert , that in this instance killing 's no murder .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 65]: You will observe , Ned , that by the laws of society , any one who attempts the life of another has forfeited his own ; at the same time , as it is necessary that the fact should be clearly proved , and justice be duly administered , the parties are tried , convicted , and then are sentenced to the punishment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 7]: `` I grant all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 42]: `` In this instance the attempt has been clearly proved ; we are the witnesses , and are the judges and jury , and society in general , for the best of all possible reasons , because there is nobody else .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 43]: These men 's lives , being therefore forfeited to society , belong to us ; and it does not follow because they were not all killed in the attempt , that therefore they are not now to be brought out for punishment .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 24]: And as there is no common hangman here , we , of course , must do this duty as well as every other .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 17]: I have now clearly proved that I am justified in what I am about to do .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 32]: But the argument does not stop there -- self-preservation is the first law of nature , and if we do not get rid of this man , what is the consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 38]: -- that we shall have to account for his being wounded , and then , instead of judges , we shall immediately be placed in the position of culprits , and have to defend ourselves without witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 17]: We therefore risk our lives from a misplaced lenity towards a wretch unworthy to live . ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 30]: `` Your last argument is strong , Easy , but I can not consent to your doing what may occasion you uneasiness hereafter when you think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 8]: nonsense -- I am a philosopher . ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 7]: `` Of what school , Jack ?
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 12]: Oh , I presume you are a disciple of Mesty 's .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 17]: I do not mean to say that you are wrong , but still hear my proposition .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 17]: Let us lower down the sail , and then I can leave the to assist you .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 15]: We will clear the vessel of everything except the man who is still alive .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 40]: At all events we may wait a little , and if at last there is no help for it , I will then agree with you to launch him overboard , even if he is not quite dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 17]: `` Agreed ; even by your own making out , it will be no great sin .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 39]: He is half dead already -- I only do half the work of tossing him over , so it will be only quarter murder on my part , and he would have shown no quarter on his . ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 17]: Here Jack left off arguing and punning , and went forward and lowered down the sail .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 44]: `` I 've half a mind to take my doubloons back , '' said Jack , as they launched over the body of the padrone , `` but he may have them -- I wonder whether they 'll ever turn up again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 12]: `` Not in our time , Jack , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 34]: The other body , and all the basket , lumber , etc , were then tossed over , and the boat was cleared of all but the man who was not yet dead .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 22]: `` Now let 's examine the fellow , and see if he has any chance of recovery , '' said Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 18]: The man lay on his side ; Gascoigne turned him over and found that he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 20]: `` Over with him , quick , '' said Jack , `` before he comes to life again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 13]: The body disappeared under the wave -- they again hoisted the sail .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 51]: Gascoigne took the helm , and our hero proceeded to draw water and wash away the stains of blood ; he then cleared the boat of vine-leaves and rubbish , with which it was strewed , swept it clean fore and aft , and resumed his seat by his comrade .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 21]: `` There , '' said Jack , `` now we 've swept the decks , we may pipe to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 13]: I wonder whether there is anything to eat in the locker . ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 24]: Jack opened it , and found some bread , garlic , sausages , a bottle of aquadente , and a jar of wine .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 13]: `` So the padrone did keep his promise , after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 24]: `` Yes , and had you not tempted him with the sight of so much gold , might now have been alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 27]: `` To which I reply , that if you had not advised our going off in a speronare , he would now have been alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 19]: `` And if you had not fought a duel , I should not have given the advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 28]: `` And if the boatswain had not been obliged to come on board without his trousers at Gibraltar , I should not have fought a duel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 20]: `` And if you had not joined the ship , the boatswain would have had his trousers on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 48]: `` And if my father had not been a philosopher , I should not have gone to sea ; so that it is all my father 's fault , and he has killed four men off the coast of Sicily without knowing it -- cause and effect .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 23]: After all , there 's nothing like argument ; so , having settled that point , let us go to dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 25]: Having finished their meal , Jack went forward and observed the land ahead ; they steered the same course for three or four hours .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 49]: `` We must haul our wind more , '' said Gascoigne ; `` it will not do to put into any small town ; we have now to choose whether we shall land on the coast and sink the speronare , or land at some large town . ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 11]: `` We must argue that point , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 47]: `` In the meantime , do you take the helm , for my arm is quite tired , '' replied Gascoigne : `` you can steer well enough : by-the-bye , I may as well look at my shoulder , for it is quite stiff . ''
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 27]: Gascoigne pulled off his coat , and found his shirt bloody and sticking to the wound , which , as we before observed , was slight .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 19]: He again took the helm , while Jack washed it clean , and then bathed it with aquadente .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 20]: `` Now take the helm again , '' said Gascoigne ; `` I 'm on the sick list . ''
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 22]: `` And as surgeon -- I 'm an idler , '' replied Jack ; `` but what shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 21]: continued he ; `` abandon the speronare at night and sink her , or run in for a town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 26]: `` We shall fall in with plenty of boats and vessels if we coast it up to Palermo , and they may overhaul us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 22]: `` We shall fall in with plenty of people if we go on shore , and they will overhaul us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 26]: `` Do you know , Jack , that I wish we were back and alongside of the Harpy , I 've had cruising enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 31]: `` My cruises are so unfortunate , '' replied Jack ; `` they are too full of adventure ; but then I have never yet had a cruise on shore .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 20]: Now , if we could only get to Palermo , we should be out of all our difficulties . ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 22]: `` The breeze freshens , Jack , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` and it begins to look very dirty to windward .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 9]: I think we shall have a gale . ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 32]: `` Pleasant -- I know what it is to be short-handed in a gale ; however , there 's one comfort , we shall not be blown off-shore this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 13]: `` No , but we may be wrecked on a lee shore .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 36]: She can not carry her whole sail , Easy ; we must lower it down , and take in a reef ; the sooner the better , for it will be dark in an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 15]: Go forward and lower it down , and then I 'll help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 20]: Jack did so , but the sail went into the water , and he could not drag it in .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 23]: `` Avast heaving , '' said Gascoigne , `` till I throw her up and take the wind out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 53]: This was done : they reefed the sail , but could not hoist it up : if Gascoigne left the helm to help Jack , the sail filled ; if he went to the helm and took the wind out of the sail , Jack was not strong enough to hoist it .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 41]: The wind increased rapidly , and the sea got up ; the sun went down , and with the sail half hoisted , they could not keep to the wind , but were obliged to run right for the land .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 49]: The speronare flew , rising on the crest of the waves with half her keel clear of the water : the moon was already up , and gave them light enough to perceive that they were not five miles from the coast , which was lined with foam .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 30]: `` At all events they ca n't accuse us of running away with the boat , '' observed Jack ; `` for she 's running away with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' replied Gascoigne , dragging at the tiller with all his strength ; `` she has taken the bit between her teeth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 25]: `` I would n't care if I had a bit between mine , '' replied Jack ; `` for I feel devilish hungry again .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 8]: What do you say , Ned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 30]: `` With all my heart , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` but , do you know , Easy , it may be the last meal we ever make . ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 17]: `` Then I vote it 's a good one -- but why so , Ned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 16]: `` In half an hour , or thereabouts , we shall be on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 12]: `` Well , that 's where we want to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 22]: `` Yes , but the sea runs high , and the boat may be dashed to pieces on the rocks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 15]: `` Then we shall be asked no questions about her or the men . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 31]: `` Very true , but a lee shore is no joke ; we may be knocked to pieces as well as the boat -- even swimming may not help us .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 20]: If we could find a cove or sandy beach , we might perhaps manage to get on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 29]: `` Well , '' replied Jack , `` I have not been long at sea , and , of course , can not know much about these things .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 15]: I have been blown off shore , but I never have been blown on .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 29]: It may be as you say , but I do not see the great danger -- let 's run her right up on the beach at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 31]: `` That 's what I shall try to do , '' replied Gascoigne , who had been four years at sea , and knew very well what he was about .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 11]: Jack handed him a huge piece of bread and sausage .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 10]: `` Thank ye , I can not eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 13]: `` I can , '' replied Jack , with his mouth full .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 21]: Jack ate while Gascoigne steered ; and the rapidity with which the speronare rushed to the beach was almost frightful .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 28]: She darted like an arrow from wave to wave , and appeared as if mocking their attempts as they curled their summits almost over her narrow stern .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 45]: They were within a mile of the beach , when Jack , who had finished his supper , and was looking at the foam boiling on the coast , exclaimed -- `` That 's very fine -- very beautiful , upon my soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 21]: `` He cares for nothing , '' thought Gascoigne ; `` he appears to have no idea of danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 23]: `` Now , my dear fellow , '' said Gascoigne , `` in a few minutes we shall be on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 40]: I must continue at the helm , for the higher she is forced up the better chance for us ; but we may not meet again , so if we do not , good-bye and God bless you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 31]: `` Gascoigne , '' said Jack , `` you are hurt , and I am not ; your shoulder is stiff , and you can hardly move your left arm .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 12]: Now I can steer for the rocks as well as you .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 51]: Do you go to the bow , and there you will have a better chance -- By-the-bye , '' continued he , picking up his pistols , and sticking them into his waist , `` I wo n't leave them , they 've served us too good a turn already .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 8]: Gascoigne , give me the helm . ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 8]: `` No , no , Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 29]: `` I say yes , '' replied Jack , in a loud , authoritative tone , `` and what 's more , I will be obeyed , Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 21]: I have nerve , if I have n't knowledge , and at all events I can steer for the beach .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 9]: I tell you , give me the helm .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 15]: Well , then , if you wo n't , I must take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 16]: Easy wrested the tiller from Gascoigne 's hand , and gave him a shove forward .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 16]: `` Now do you look out ahead , and tell me how to steer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 53]: Whatever may have been Gascoigne 's feelings at this behaviour of our hero 's , it immediately occurred to him that he could not do better than to run the speronare to the safest point , and that therefore he was probably more advantageously employed than if he were at the helm .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 31]: He went forward and looked at the rocks , covered at one moment with the tumultuous waters , and then pouring down cascades from their sides as the waves recoiled .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 45]: He perceived a chasm right ahead , and he thought if the boat was steered for that , she must be thrown up so as to enable them to get clear of her , for , at every other part , escape appeared impossible .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 9]: `` Starboard a little -- that 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 15]: Steady -- port it is -- port-Steer small , for your life , Easy .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 16]: Steady now -- mind the yard do n't hit your head -- hold on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 57]: The speronare was at this moment thrown into a large cleft in a rock , the sides of which were nearly perpendicular ; nothing else could have saved them , as , had they struck the rock outside , the boat would have been dashed to pieces , and its fragments have disappeared in the undertow .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 72]: As it was , the cleft was not four feet more than the width of the boat , and as the waves hurled her up into it , the yard of the speronare was thrown fore and aft with great violence , and had not Jack been warned , he would have been struck overboard without a chance of being saved ; but he crouched down and it passed over him .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 40]: As the water receded , the boat struck , and was nearly dry between the rocks , but another wave followed , dashing the boat further up , but , at the same time , filling it with water .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 44]: The bow of the boat was now several feet higher than the stem , where Jack held on ; and the weight of the water in her , with the force of the returning waves , separated her right across abaft the mast .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 61]: Jack perceived that the after part of the boat was going out again with the wave ; he caught hold of the yard which had swung fore and aft , and as he clung to it , the part of the boat on which he had stood disappeared from under him , and was swept away by the returning current .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 49]: Jack required the utmost of his strength to maintain his position until another wave floated him , and dashed him higher up : but he knew his life depended on holding on to the yard , which he did , although under water , and advanced several feet .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 41]: When the wave receded , he found footing on the rock , and still clinging , he walked till he had gained the fore part of the boat , which was wedged firmly into a narrow part of the cleft .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 24]: The next wave was not very large , and he had gained so much that it did not throw him off his legs .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 37]: He reached the rock , and as he climbed up the side of the chasm to gain the ledge above , he perceived Gascoigne standing above him , and holding out his hand to his assistance .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 34]: `` Well , '' says Jack , shaking himself to get rid of the water , `` here we are ashore , at last -- I had no idea of anything like this .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 21]: The rush back of the water was so strong that it has almost tom my arms out of their sockets .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 12]: How very lucky I sent you forward with your disabled shoulder !
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 27]: By-the-bye , now that it 's all over , and you must see that I was right , I beg to apologise for my rudeness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 40]: `` There needs no apology for saving my life , Easy , '' replied Gascoigne , trembling with the cold ; `` and no one but you would ever have thought of making one at such a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 23]: `` I wonder whether the ammunition 's dry , '' said Jack ; `` I put it all in my hat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 14]: Jack took off his hat , and found the cartridges had not suffered .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 13]: `` Now , then , Gascoigne , what shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 9]: `` I hardly know , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 13]: `` Suppose then , we sit down and argue the point . ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 30]: `` No , I thank you , there will be too much cold water thrown upon our arguments -- I 'm half dead ; let us walk on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 62]: `` With all my heart , '' said Jack , `` it 's devilish steep , but I can argue up hill or down hill , wet or dry -- I 'm used to it -- for , as I told you before , Ned , my father is a philosopher , and so am I. '' `` By the Lord !
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 12]: you are , '' replied Gascoigne , as he walked on .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 14]: CHAPTER XIX In which our hero follows his destiny and forms a tableau .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 31]: Our hero and his comrade climbed the precipice , and , after some minutes ' severe toil , arrived at the summit , when they sat down to recover themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 11]: The sky was clear , although the gale blew strong .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 15]: They had an extensive view of the coast , lashed by the angry waves .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 33]: `` It 's my opinion , Ned , '' said Jack , as he surveyed the expanse of troubled water , `` that we 're just as well out of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 32]: `` I agree with you , Jack ; but it 's also my opinion that we should be just as well out of this , for the wind blows through one .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 19]: Suppose we go a little further inland , where we may find some shelter till the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 63]: `` It 's rather dark to find anything , '' rejoined our hero ; `` but however , a westerly gale on the top of a mountain with wet clothes in the middle of the night , with nothing to eat or drink , is not the most comfortable position in the world , and we may change for the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 22]: They proceeded over a flat of a hundred yards , and then descended -- the change in the atmosphere was immediate .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 43]: As they continued their march inland , they came to a high road , which appeared to run along the shore , and they turned into it ; for , as Jack said very truly , a road must lead to something .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 26]: After a quarter of an hour 's walk , they again heard the rolling of the surf , and perceived the white walls of houses .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 11]: `` Here we are at last , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 34]: `` I wonder if any one will turn out to take us in , or shall we stow away for the night in one of those vessels hauled up on the beach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 66]: `` Recollect this time , Easy , '' said Gascoigne , `` not to show your money ; that is , show only a dollar , and say you have no more ; or promise to pay when we arrive at Palermo ; and if they will neither trust us , nor give to us , we must make it out as we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 7]: `` How the cursed dogs bark !
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 41]: I think we shall do very well this time , Gascoigne ; we do not look as if we were worth robbing , at all events , and we have the pistols to defend ourselves with if we are attacked .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 10]: Depend upon it I will show no more gold .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 8]: And now let us make our arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 27]: Take you one pistol and take half the gold -- I have it all in my right-hand pocket -- my dollars and pistarenes in my left .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 8]: You shall take half of them too .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 17]: We have silver enough to go on with till we are in a safe place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 16]: Jack then divided the money in the dark , and also gave Gascoigne a pistol .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 11]: `` Now , then , shall we knock for admittance ?
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 18]: Let 's first walk through the village , and see if there 's anything like an inn .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 18]: Those yelping curs will soon be at our heels ; they come nearer and nearer every time .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 31]: There 's a cart , and it 's full of straw -- suppose we go to bed till to-morrow morning -- we shall be warm , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' replied Gascoigne , `` and sleep much better than in any of the cottages .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 18]: I have been in Sicily before , and you have no idea how the fleas bite . ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 27]: Our two midshipmen climbed up into the cart , nestled themselves into the straw , or rather Indian corn leaves , and were soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 96]: As they had not slept for two nights , it is not to be wondered at that they slept soundly so soundly , indeed , that about two hours after they had got into their comfortable bed , the peasant , who had brought to the village some casks of wine to be shipped and taken down the coast in a felucca , yoked his bullocks , and not being aware of his freight , drove off , without in any way disturbing their repose , although the roads in Sicily are not yet macadamised .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 54]: The jolting of the roads rather increased than disturbed the sleep of our adventurers ; and , although there were some rude shocks , it only had the effect of making them fancy in their dreams that they were again in the boat , and that she was still dashing against the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 22]: In about two hours , the cart arrived at its destination -- the peasant unyoked his bullocks and led them away .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 43]: The same cause will often produce contrary effects : the stopping of the motion of the cart disturbed the rest of our two midshipmen ; they turned round in the straw , yawned , spread out their arms , and then awoke .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 19]: Gascoigne , who felt considerable pain in his shoulder , was the first to recall his scattered senses .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 18]: `` Easy , '' cried he , as he sat up and shook off the corn leaves .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 12]: `` Port it is , '' said Jack , half dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 12]: `` Come , Easy , you are not on board now .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 5]: Rouse and bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 9]: Jack then sat up and looked at Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 31]: The forage in the cart was so high round them that they could not see above it ; they rubbed their eyes , yawned , and looked at each other .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 9]: `` Have you any faith in dreams ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 17]: said Jack to Gascoigne , `` because I had a very queer one last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 11]: `` Well , so had I , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 44]: `` I dreamt that the cart rolled by itself into the sea , and went away with us right in the wind 's eye back to Malta ; and considering that it never was built for such service , she behaved uncommonly well .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 8]: Now , what was your dream ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 49]: `` Mine was , that we woke up and found ourselves in the very town from which the speronare had sailed , and that they had found the fore part of the speronare among the rocks , had recognised her , and picked up one of our pistols .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 43]: That they had laid hold of us , and had insisted that we had been thrown on shore in the boat , and asked us what had become of the crew -- they were just seizing us , when I awoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 24]: `` Your dream is more likely to come true than mine , Easy ; but still I think we need not fear that .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 69]: At the same time , we had better not remain here any longer ; and it occurs to me , that if we tore our clothes more , it would be advisable -- we shall , in the first place , look more wretched ; and , in the next place , can replace them with the dress of the country , and so travel without exciting suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 11]: You know that I can speak Italian pretty well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 37]: `` I have no objection to tear my clothes if you wish , '' replied Jack ; `` at the same time give me your pistol ; I will draw the charges and load them again .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 6]: They must be wet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 22]: Having reloaded the pistols and rent their garments , the two midshipmen stood up in the cart and looked about them .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 3]: `` Halloo !
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 8]: -- why how 's this , Gascoigne ?
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 22]: last night we were close to the beach , and among houses , and now -- where the devil are we ?
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 19]: You dreamt nearer the mark than I did , for the cart has certainly taken a cruise . ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 24]: `` We must have slept like midshipmen , then , '' replied Gascoigne : `` surely it can not have gone far . ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 20]: `` Here we are , surrounded by hills on every side , for at least a couple of miles .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 34]: Surely some good genius has transported us into the interior , that we might escape from the relatives of the crew whom I dreamt about , '' said Jack , looking at Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 33]: As it afterwards was known to them , the speronare had sailed from the very seaport in which they had arrived that night , and where they had got into the cart .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 33]: The wreck of the speronare had been found , and had been recognised , and it was considered by the inhabitants that the padrone and his crew had perished in the gale .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 37]: Had they found our two midshipmen and questioned them , it is not improbable that suspicion might have been excited , and the results have been such as our hero had conjured up in his dream .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 15]: But , as we said before , there is a peculiar providence for midshipmen .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 42]: On a minute survey , they found that they were in an open space which , apparently , had been used for thrashing and winnowing maize , and that the cart was standing under a clump of trees in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 26]: `` There ought to be a house hereabouts , '' said Gascoigne , `` I should think that behind the trees we shall find one .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 28]: Come , Jack , you are as hungry as I am , I 'll answer for it : we must look out for a breakfast somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 39]: `` If they wo n't give us something to eat , or sell it , '' replied Jack , who was ravenous , clutching his pistol , `` I shall take it -- I consider it no robbery .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 27]: The fruits of the earth were made for us all , and it never was intended that one man should have a superfluity and another starve .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 35]: The laws of equality -- '' `` May appear very good arguments to a starving man , I grant , but still wo n't prevent his fellow-creatures from hanging him , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 42]: `` None of your confounded nonsense , Jack ; no man starves with money in his pocket , and as long as you have that , leave those that have none to talk about equality and the rights of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 14]: `` I should like to argue that point with you , Gascoigne . ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 24]: `` Tell me , do you prefer sitting down here to argue , or to look out for some breakfast , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 16]: `` Oh , the argument may be put off , but hunger can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 16]: `` That 's very good philosophy , Jack , so let 's go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 27]: They went through the copse of wood , which was very thick , and soon discovered the wall of a large house on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 15]: `` All right , '' said Jack ; `` but still let us reconnoitre .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 33]: It 's not a farmhouse ; it must belong to a person of some consequence -- all the better -- they will see that we are gentlemen , notwithstanding our tattered dress .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 16]: I suppose we are to stick to the story of the sea-mews at Gozo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` I can think of nothing better .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 17]: But the English are well received in this island ; we have troops at Palermo . ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 4]: `` Have we ?
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 15]: I wish I was sitting down at the mess-table -- but what 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 4]: a woman screaming ?
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 5]: Yes , by heavens !
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 7]: -- come along , Ned . ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 11]: And away dashed Jack towards the house followed by Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 45]: As they advanced the screams redoubled ; they entered the porch , burst into the room from whence they proceeded , and found an elderly gentleman defending himself against two young men , who were held back by an elderly and a young lady .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 33]: Our hero and his comrade had both drawn their pistols , and just as they burst open the door , the old gentleman who defended himself against such odds had fallen down .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 51]: The two others burst from the women , and were about to pierce him with their swords , when Jack seized one by the collar of his coat and held him fast , pointing the muzzle of the pistol to his ear : Gascoigne did the same to the other .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 7]: It was a very dramatic tableau .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 78]: The two women flew to the elderly gentleman and raised him up ; the two assailants being held just as dogs hold pigs by the ear , trembling with fright , with the points of their rapiers dropped , looked at the midshipmen and the muzzles of their pistols with equal dismay ; at the same time , the astonishment of the elderly gentleman and the women , at such an unexpected deliverance , was equally great .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 9]: There was a silence for a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 23]: `` Ned , '' at last said Jack , `` tell these chaps to drop their swords , or we fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 13]: Gascoigne gave the order in Italian , and it was complied with .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 17]: The midshipmen then possessed themselves of the rapiers , and gave the young men their liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 9]: The elderly gentleman at last broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 27]: `` It would appear , signors , that there was a special interference of Providence , to prevent you from committing a foul and unjust murder .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 61]: Who these are who have so opportunely come to my rescue , I know not , but thanking them as I do now , I think that you will yourselves , when you are calm , also thank them for having prevented you from committing an act which would have loaded you with remorse , and embittered your future existence .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 53]: Gentleman , you are free to depart : you , Don Silvio , have indeed disappointed me ; your gratitude should have rendered you incapable of such conduct : as for you , Don Scipio , you have been misled ; but you both have , in one point , disgraced yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 17]: Ten days back my sons were both here , -- why did you not come then ?
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 38]: If you sought revenge on me , you could not have inflicted it deeper than through my children , and at least you would not have acted the part of assassins in attacking , an old man .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 12]: Take your swords , gentlemen , and use them better henceforth .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 10]: Against future attacks I shall be well prepared . ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 29]: Gascoigne , who perfectly understood what was said , presented the sword to the young gentleman from whom he had taken it -- our hero did the same .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 19]: The two young men returned them to their sheaths , and quitted the room without saying a word .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 31]: `` Whoever you are , I owe to you and thank you for my life , '' said the elderly gentleman , scanning the outward appearance of our two midshipmen .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 63]: `` We are , '' replied Gascoigne , `` officers in the English navy , and gentlemen ; we were wrecked in our boat last night , and have wandered here in the dark , seeking for assistance , and food , and some conveyance to Palermo , where we shall find friends , and the means of appearing like gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 9]: `` Was your ship wrecked , gentlemen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 11]: inquired the Sicilian , `` and many lives lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 32]: `` No , our ship is at Malta ; we were in a boat on a party of pleasure , were caught by a gale , and driven on the coast .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 29]: To satisfy you of the truth , observe that our pistols have the king 's mark , and that we are not paupers we show you gold . ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 29]: Gascoigne pulled out his doubloons -- and Jack did the same , coolly observing , -- `` I thought we were only to show silver , Ned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 55]: `` It needed not that , '' replied the gentleman ; `` your conduct in this affair , your manners and address , fully convince me that you are what you represent ; but were you common peasants , I am equally indebted to you for my life , and you may command me .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 12]: Tell me in what way I can be of service . ''
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 19]: `` In giving us something to eat , for we have had nothing for many , many hours .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 17]: After that we may , perhaps , trespass a little more upon your kind offices . ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 65]: `` You must , of course , be surprised at what has passed , and curious to know the occasion , '' said the gentleman ; `` you have a right to be informed of it , and shall be , as soon as you are more comfortable ; in the meantime , allow me to introduce myself as Don Rebiera de Silva . ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 41]: `` I wish , '' said Jack , who , from his knowledge of Spanish , could understand the whole of the last part of the Don 's speech , `` that he would introduce us to his breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 27]: `` So do I , '' said Gascoigne ; `` but we must wait a little -- he ordered the ladies to prepare something instantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 13]: `` Your friend does not speak Italian , '' said Don Rebiera .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 13]: `` No , Don Rebiera , he speaks French and Spanish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 21]: `` If he speaks Spanish , my daughter can converse with him ; she has but shortly arrived from Spain .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 13]: We are closely united with a noble house in that country . ''
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 30]: Don Rebiera then led the way to another room , and in a short time there was a repast brought in , to which our midshipmen did great justice .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 40]: `` I will now , '' said the Don , `` relate to you , sir , for the information of yourself and friend , the causes which produced this scene of violence , which you so opportunely defeated .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 62]: But first , as it must be very tedious to your friend , I will send for Donna Clara and my daughter Agnes to talk to him ; my wife understands a little Spanish , and my daughter , as I said before , has but just left the country , where , from circumstances , she remained some years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 43]: As soon as Donna Clara and Donna Agnes made their appearance and were introduced , Jack , who had not before paid attention to them , said to himself , `` I have seen a face like that girl 's before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 45]: If so , he had never seen many like it , for it was the quintessence of brunette beauty , and her figure was equally perfect ; although , not having yet completed her fifteenth year , it required still a little more development .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 53]: Donna Clara was extremely gracious , and as , perhaps , she was aware that her voice would drown that of her husband , she proposed to our hero to walk in the garden , and in a few minutes they took their seats in a pavilion at the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 32]: The old lady did not talk much Spanish , but when at a loss for a word , she put in an Italian one , and Jack understood her perfectly well .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 209]: She told him her sister had married a Spanish nobleman many years since , and that before the war broke out between the Spanish and the English they had gone over with all their children to see her ; that when they wished to return , her daughter Agnes , then a child , was suffering under a lingering complaint , and it was thought advisable , as she was very weak , to leave her under the charge of her aunt , who had a little girl of nearly the same age ; that they were educated together at a convent , near Tarragona , and that she had only returned two months ago ; that she had a very narrow escape , as the ship in which her uncle , and aunt , and cousins , as well as herself , were on board , returning from Genoa , where her brother-in-law had been obliged to go to secure a succession to some property bequeathed to him , had been captured in the night by the English ; but the officer , who was very polite , had allowed them to go away next day , and very handsomely permitted them to take all their effects .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 41]: `` Oh , oh , '' thought Jack ; `` I thought I had seen her face before ; this then was one of the girls in the corner of the cabin -- now I 'll have some fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 29]: During the conversation with the mother , Donna Agnes had remained some paces behind , picking now and then a flower , and not attending to what passed .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 24]: When our hero and her mother sat down in the pavilion she joined then , when Jack addressed her with his usual politeness .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 32]: `` I am almost ashamed to be sitting by you , Donna Agnes , in this ragged dress -- but the rocks of your coast have no respect for persons . ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 17]: `` We are under great obligations , signor , and do not regard such trifles . ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 38]: `` You are all kindness , signora , '' replied Jack ; `` I little thought this morning of my good fortune , -- I can tell the fortunes of others , but not my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 7]: `` You can tell fortunes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 5]: replied the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 19]: `` Yes , madame , I am famous for it -- shall I tell your daughter hers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 10]: Donna Agnes looked at our hero , and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 29]: `` I perceive that the young lady does not believe me ; I must prove my art , by telling her of what has already happened to her .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 9]: The signora will then give me credit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 12]: `` Certainly , if you do that , '' replied Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 14]: `` Oblige me , by showing me the palm of your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 20]: Agnes extended her little hand , and Jack felt so very polite , that he was nearly kissing it .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 63]: However , he restrained himself , and examining the lines -- `` That you were educated in Spain -- that you arrived here but two months ago -- that you were captured and released by the English , your mother has already told me ; but to prove to you that I knew all that , I must now be more particular .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 15]: You were in a ship mounting fourteen guns -- was it not so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 6]: Donna Agnes nodded her head .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 13]: `` I never told the signor that , '' cried Donna Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 16]: `` She was taken by surprise in the night , and there was no fighting .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 20]: The next morning the English burst open the cabin-door ; your uncle and your cousin fired their pistols . ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 5]: `` Holy Virgin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 6]: cried Agnes , with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 14]: `` The English officer was a young man , not very good-looking . ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 14]: `` There you are wrong , signor -- he was very handsome . ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 10]: `` There is no accounting for taste , signora .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 22]: You were frightened out of your wits , and with your cousin you crouched down in the corner of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 8]: Let me examine that little line closer .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 18]: You had -- yes , it 's no mistake -- you had very little clothes on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 10]: Agnes tore away her hand and covered her face .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 10]: `` E vero , e vero ; Holy Jesus !
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 7]: how could you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 18]: Of a sudden Agnes looked at our hero , and after a minute appeared to recognise him .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 18]: `` Oh , mother , 't is he -- I recollect now , 't is he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 7]: `` Who , my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 17]: replied Donna Clara , who had been struck dumb with Jack 's astonishing power of fortune-telling .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 12]: `` The officer who captured us and was so kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 23]: Jack burst out into a laughter not to be controlled for some minutes , and then acknowledged that she had discovered him .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 34]: `` At all events , Donna Agnes , '' said he at last , `` acknowledge that , ragged as I am , I have seen you in a much greater dishabille . ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 36]: Agnes sprang up , and took to her heels , that she might hide her confusion , and at the same time go to her father and tell him who he had as his guest .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 36]: Although Don Rebiera had not yet finished his narrative , this announcement of Agnes , who ran in breathless to communicate it , immediately brought all the parties together , and Jack received their thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 24]: `` I little thought , '' said the Don , `` that I should have been so doubly indebted to you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 11]: Command my services as you please , both of you .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 28]: My sons are at Palermo , and I trust you will allow them the pleasure of your friendship when you are tired of remaining with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 49]: Jack made his politest bow , and then with a shrug of his shoulders looked down upon his habiliments , which , to please Gascoigne , he had torn into ribands , as much as to say , `` We are not provided for a lengthened stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 29]: `` My brothers ' clothes will fit them , I think , '' said Agnes to her father ; `` they have left plenty in their wardrobes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 17]: `` If the signors will condescend to wear them till they can replace their own . ''
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 5]: Midshipmen are very condescending .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 20]: They followed Don Rebiera , and condescended to put on clean shirts belonging to Don Philip and Don Martin .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 41]: Also to put on their trousers , to select their best waistcoats and coats ; in short , they condescended to have a regular fit-out -- and it so happened that the fit-out was not far from a regular fit .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 37]: Having condescended , they then descended , and the intimacy between all parties became so great that it appeared as if they not only wore the young men 's clothes but also stood in their shoes .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 59]: Having thus made themselves presentable , Jack presented his hand to both ladies and led them into the garden , that Don Rebiera might finish his long story to Gascoigne without further interruption , and resuming their seats in the pavilion , he entertained the ladies with a history of his cruise in the ship after her capture .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 31]: Agnes soon recovered from her reserve , and Jack had the forbearance not to allude again to the scene in the cabin , which was the only thing she dreaded .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 41]: After dinner , when the family , according to custom , had retired for the siesta , Gascoigne and Jack , who had slept enough in the cart to last for a week , went out together in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 21]: `` Well , Ned , '' said Jack , `` do you wish yourself on board the Harpy again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 31]: `` No , '' replied Gascoigne , `` we have fallen on our feet at last , but still not without first being knocked about like peas in a rattle .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 9]: What a lovely little creature that Agnes is !
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 11]: How strange that you should fall in with her again !
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 9]: How odd that we should come here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 11]: `` My good fellow , we did not come here .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 7]: Destiny brought us in a cart .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 12]: She may take us to Tyburn in the same way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 18]: `` Yes , if you sport your philosophy as you did when we awoke this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 13]: `` Nevertheless , I 'll be hanged if I 'm not right .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 7]: Suppose we argue the point ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 34]: `` Right or wrong , you will be hanged , Jack ; so instead of arguing the point , suppose I tell you what the Don made such a long story about . ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 14]: `` With all my heart -- let us go to the pavilion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 28]: Our hero and his friend took their seats , and Gascoigne then communicated the history of Don Rebiera , to which we shall dedicate the ensuing chapter .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 19]: CHAPTER XX A long story , which the reader must listen to , as well as our hero .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 40]: `` I have already made you acquainted with my name , and I have only to add that it is one of the most noble in Sicily , and that there are few families who possess such large estates .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 37]: My father was a man who had no pleasure in the pursuits of most of the young men of his age ; he was of a weakly constitution , and was with difficulty reared to manhood .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 36]: When his studies were completed he retired to his country seat belonging to our family , which is about twenty miles from Palermo , and shutting himself up , devoted himself wholly to literary pursuits .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 34]: `` As he was an only son , his parents were naturally very anxious that he should marry ; the more so as his health did not promise him a very extended existence .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 41]: Had he consulted his own inclinations he would have declined , but he felt that it was his duty to comply with their wishes ; but he did not trouble himself with the choice , leaving it wholly to them .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 15]: They selected a young lady of high family and certainly of most exquisite beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 30]: I only wish I could say more in her favour -- for she was my mother -- but it is impossible to narrate the history without exposing her conduct .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 58]: The marriage took place , and my father -- having woke up , as it were , at the celebration -- again returned to his closet , to occupy himself in abstruse studies -- the results of which have been published , and have fully established his reputation as a man of superior talent and deep research .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 74]: But , however much the public may appreciate the works of a man of genius , whether they be written to instruct or to amuse , certain it is that a literary man requires in his wife either a mind congenial to his own , or that pride in her husband 's talents which induces her to sacrifice much of her own domestic enjoyment to the satisfaction of having his name extolled abroad .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 13]: I mention this point as some extenuation of my mother 's conduct .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 68]: She was neglected most certainly , but not neglected for frivolous amusements , or because another form had captivated his fancy ; but in his desire to instruct others , and I may add his ambition for renown , he applied himself to his literary pursuits , became abstracted , answered without hearing , and left his wife to amuse herself in any way she might please .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 66]: A literary husband is , without exception -- although always at home -- the least domestic husband in the world , and must try the best of tempers -- not by unkindness , for my father was kind and indulgent to excess , but by that state of perfect abstraction and indifference which he , showed to everything except the favourite pursuit which absorbed him .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 18]: My mother had but to speak , and every wish was granted -- a refusal was unknown .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 10]: You may say , what could she want more ?
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 13]: I reply , that anything to a woman is preferable to indifference .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 37]: The immediate consent to every wish took away , in her opinion , all merit in the grant -- the value of everything is only relative , and in proportion to the difficulty of obtaining it .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 23]: The immediate assent to every opinion was tantamount to insult -- it implied that he did not choose to argue with her .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 36]: `` It is true that women like to have their own way -- but they like at the same time to have difficulties to surmount and to conquer ; otherwise half the gratification is lost .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 56]: Although tempests are to be deplored , still a certain degree of oscillation an motion are requisite to keep fresh and clear the lake of matrimony , the waters of which otherwise soon stagnate and become foul , and without some contrary currents of opinion between a married couple such a stagnation must take place .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 48]: `` A woman permitted always and invariably to have her own way without control is much in the same situation as the child who insists upon a whole instead of half a holiday , and before the evening closes is tired of himself and everything about him .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 42]: In short , a little contradiction , like salt at dinner , seasons and appetises the repast ; but too much , Eke the condiment in question , spoils the whole , and it becomes unpalatable in proportion to its excess .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 36]: `` My mother was a vain woman in every sense of the word -- vain of her birth and of her beauty , and accustomed to receive that homage to which she considered herself entitled .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 42]: She had been spoiled in her infancy , and as she grew up had leant nothing , because she was permitted to do as she pleased ; she was therefore frivolous , and could not appreciate what she could not comprehend .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 9]: There never was a more ill-assorted union . ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 50]: `` I have always thought that such must be the case , '' replied Gascoigne , `` in Catholic countries , where a young person is taken out of a convent and mated according to what her family or her wealth may consider as the most eligible connection . ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 17]: `` On that subject there are many opinions , my friend , '' replied Don Rebiera .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 130]: `` It is true , that when a marriage of convenience is arranged by the parents , the dispositions of the parties are made a secondary point ; but then , again , it must be remembered , that when a choice is left to the parties themselves , it is at an age at which there is little worldly consideration : and , led away , in the first place , by their passions , they form connections with those inferior in their station which are attended with eventual unhappiness ; or , in the other , allowing that they do choose in their own rank of life , they make quite as bad or often a worse choice than if their partners were selected for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 11]: `` I can not understand that , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 26]: `` The reason is , because there are no means , or , if means , no wish , to study each other 's disposition .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 52]: A young man is attracted by person , and he admires ; the young woman is flattered by the admiration , and is agreeable ; if she has any faults she is not likely to display them -- not concealing them from hypocrisy , but because they are not called out .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 36]: The young man falls in love , so does the young woman : and when once in love , they can no longer see faults ; they marry , imagining that they have found perfection .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 38]: In the blindness of love each raises the other to a standard of perfection which human nature can never attain , and each becomes equally annoyed on finding , by degrees , that they were in error .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 21]: The re-action takes place , and they then under-rate , as much as before they had over-rated , each other .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 33]: Now , if two young people marry without this violence of passion , they do not expect to find each other perfect , and perhaps have a better chance of happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 44]: `` I do n't agree with you , '' thought Gascoigne ; `` but as you appear to be as fond of argument as my friend Jack , I shall make no reply , lest there be no end to the story . ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 4]: Don Rebiera proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 48]: `` My mother , finding that my father preferred his closet and his books to gaiety and dissipation , soon left him to himself , and amused herself after her own fashion , but not until I was born , which was ten months after their marriage .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 21]: My father was confiding , and , pleased that my mother should be amused , he indulged her in everything .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 50]: Time flew on , and I had arrived at my fifteenth year , and came home from my studies , it being intended that I should enter the army , which you are aware is generally the only profession embraced in this country by the heirs of noble families .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 85]: Of course , I knew little of what had passed at home , but still I had occasionally heard my mother spoken lightly of , when I was not supposed to be present , and I always heard my father 's name mentioned with compassion , as if an ill-used man , but I knew nothing more : still this was quite sufficient for a young man , whose blood boiled at the idea of anything like a stigma being cast upon his family .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 30]: I arrived at my father 's -- I found him at his books ; I paid my respects to my mother , -- I found her with her confessor .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 53]: I disliked the man at first sight ; he was handsome , certainly : his forehead was high and white , his eyes large and fiery , and his figure commanding ; but there was a dangerous , proud look about him which disgusted me , -- nothing like humility or devotion .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 25]: I might have admired him as an officer commanding a regiment of cavalry , but as a churchman he appeared to be most misplaced .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 40]: She named me with kindness , but he appeared to treat me with disdain ; he spoke authoritatively to my mother , who appeared to yield implicitly , and I discovered that he was lord of the whole household .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 17]: My mother , too , it was said , had given up gaieties and become devout .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 49]: I soon perceived more than a common intelligence between them , and before I had been two months at home I had certain proofs of my father 's dishonour ; and , what was still more unfortunate for me , they were aware that such was the case .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 34]: `` My first impulse was to acquaint my father ; but , on consideration , I thought it better to say nothing , provided I could persuade my mother to dismiss Father Ignatio .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 33]: I took an opportunity when she was alone to express my indignation at her conduct , and to demand his immediate dismissal , as a condition of my not divulging her crime .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 29]: She appeared frightened , and gave her consent ; but I soon found that her confessor had more power with her than I had , and he remained .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 23]: I now resolved to acquaint my father , and I roused him from his studies that he might listen to his shame .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 41]: I imagined that he would have acted calmly and discreetly ; but , on the contrary , his violence was without bounds , and I had the greatest difficulty from preventing his rushing with his sword to sacrifice them both .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 37]: At last he contented himself by turning Father Ignatio out of the house in the most ignominious manner , and desiring my mother to prepare for seclusion in a convent for the remainder of her days .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 33]: But he fell their victim ; three days afterwards , as my mother was , by his directions , about to be removed , he was seized with convulsions , and died .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 25]: `` I need hardly say that he was carried off by poison ; this , however , could not be established till long afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 20]: Before he died he seemed to be almost supernaturally prepared for an event which never came into my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 26]: He sent for another confessor , who drew up his confession in writing at his own request , and afterwards inserted it in his will .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 16]: My mother remained in the house , and Father Ignatio had the insolence to return .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 9]: I ordered him away , and he resisted .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 8]: He was turned out by the servants .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 28]: I had an interview with my mother , who defied me , and told me that I should soon have a brother to share in the succession .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 23]: I felt that , if so , it would be the illegitimate progeny of her adultery , and told her my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 14]: She expressed her rage in the bitterest curses , and I left her .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 24]: Shortly afterwards she quitted the house and retired to another of our country seats , where she lived with Father Ignatio as before .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 81]: About four months afterwards , formal notice was sent to me of the birth of a brother ; but as when my father 's will was opened , he there had inserted his confession , or the substance of it , in which he stated , that aware of my mother 's guilt , and supposing that consequences might ensue , he solemnly declared before God that he had for years lived apart , I cared little for this communication .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 23]: I contented myself with replying that as the child belonged to the church , it had better be dedicated to its service .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 19]: `` I had , however , soon reason to acknowledge the vengeance of my mother and her paramour .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 33]: One night I was attacked by bravos ; and had I not fortunately received assistance , I should have forfeited my life ; as it was , I received a severe wound .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 32]: `` Against attempts of that kind I took every precaution in future , but still every attempt was made to ruin my character , as well as to take my life .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 32]: A young sister disappeared from a convent in my neighbourhood , and on the ground near the window from which she descended was found a hat , recognised to be mine .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 29]: I was proceeded against , and notwithstanding the strongest interest , it was with difficulty that the affair was arranged , although I had incontestably proved an alibi .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 36]: `` A young man of rank was found murdered , with a stiletto , known to be mine , buried in his bosom , and it was with difficulty that I could establish my innocence .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 35]: `` Part of a banditti had been seized , and on being asked the name of their chief , when they received absolution , they confessed that I was the chief of the band .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 36]: `` Everything that could be attempted was put into practice ; and if I did not lose my life , at all events I was avoided by almost everybody as a dangerous and doubtful character .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 38]: `` At last a nobleman of rank , the father of Don Scipio , whom you disarmed , was assassinated ; the bravos were taken , and they acknowledged that I was the person who hired them .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 42]: I defended myself , but the king imposed upon me a heavy fine and banishments I had just received the order , and was crying out against the injustices and lamenting my hard fate , as I sat down to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 19]: Latterly , aware of what my enemies would attempt , I had been accustomed to live much alone .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 9]: My faithful valet Pedro was my only attendant .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 16]: I was eating my dinner with little appetite , and had asked for some wine .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 14]: Pedro went to the buffet behind him to give me what I required .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 46]: Accidentally I lifted up my head , and there being a large pier-glass opposite to me , I saw the figure of my valet , and that he was pouring a powder in the flagon of wine which he was about to present to me .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 22]: I recollected the hat being found at the nunnery , and also the stiletto in the body of the young man .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 22]: `` Like lightning it occurred to me , that I had been fostering the viper who had assisted to destroy me .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 6]: He brought me the flagon .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 19]: I rose , locked the door , and drawing my sword , I addressed him -- ` Villain !
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 16]: I know thee ; down on your knees , for your life is forfeited . '
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 13]: `` He turned pale , trembled , and sank upon his knees .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 32]: ` Now then , ' continued I , ` you have but one chance either drink off this flagon of wine , or I pass my sword through your body . '
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 24]: He hesitated , and I put the point to his breast , -- even pierced the flesh a quarter of an inch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 23]: ` Drink , ' cried I , ` is it so very unjust an order to tell you to drink old wine ?
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 15]: Drink , ' continued I , ` or my sword does its duty . '
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 12]: `` He drank , and would then have quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 22]: ` No , no , ' said I , ` you remain here , and the wine must have its effect .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 18]: If I have wronged you I will make amends to you -- but I am suspicious . '
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 41]: `` In about a quarter of an hour , during which time I paced up and down the room , with my sword drawn , my servant fell down , and cried in mercy to let him have a priest .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 57]: I sent for my own confessor , and he then acknowledged that he was an agent of my mother and Father Ignatio , and had been the means of making it appear that I was the committer of all the crimes and murders which had been perpetrated by them , with a view to my destruction .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 28]: A strong emetic having been administered to him , he partially revived , and was taken to Palermo , where he gave his evidence before he expired .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 31]: `` When this was made known , the king revoked his sentence , apologised to me , and I found that once more I was visited and courted by everybody .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 38]: My mother was ordered to be shut up in a convent , where she died , I trust , in grace ; and Father Ignatio fled to Italy , and I have been informed is since dead .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 15]: `` Having thus rid myself of my principal enemies , I considered myself safe .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 42]: I married the lady whom you have just seen , and before my eldest son was born , Don Silvio , for such was the name given to my asserted legitimate brother , came of age , and demanded his succession .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 57]: Had he asked me for a proper support , as my uterine brother , I should not have refused ; but that the son of Friar Ignatio , who had so often attempted my life , should , in case of my decease , succeed to the title and estates , was not to be borne .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 65]: A lawsuit was immediately commenced , which lasted four or five years , during which Don Silvio married , and had a son , that young man whom you heard me address by the same name ; but after much litigation , it was decided that my father 's confessor and will had proved his illegitimacy , and the suit was in my favour .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 13]: From that time to this , there has been a constant enmity .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 21]: Don Silvio refused all my offers of assistance , and followed me with a pertinacity which often endangered my life .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 18]: At last he fell by the hands of his own agents , who mistook him for me .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 57]: Don Silvio died without leaving any provision for his family ; his widow I pensioned , and his son I have had carefully brought up , and have indeed treated most liberally , but he appears to have imbibed the spirit of his father , and no kindness has been able to embue him with gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 44]: `` He had lately been placed by me in the army , where he found out my two sons , and quarrelled with them both upon slight pretence ; but , in both instances , he was wounded and carried off the field .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 21]: `` My two sons have been staying with me these last two months , and did not leave till yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 35]: This morning Don Silvio , accompanied by Don Scipio , came to the house , and after accusing me of being the murderer of both their parents , drew their rapiers to assassinate me .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 21]: My wife and child , hearing the noise , came down to my assistance -- you know the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 17]: CHAPTER XXI In which our hero is brought up all standing under a press of sail .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 24]: Our limits will not permit us to relate all that passed during our hero 's stay of a fortnight at Don Rebiera 's .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 27]: He and Gascoigne were treated as if they were his own sons , and the kindness of the female part of the family was equally remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 110]: Agnes , naturally perhaps , showed a preference or partiality for Jack : to which Gascoigne willingly submitted , as he felt that our hero had a prior and stronger claim , and during the time that they remained a feeling of attachment was created between Agnes and the philosopher , which , if not love , was at least something very near akin to it , but the fact was , that they were both much too young to think of marriage ; and , although they walked and talked , and laughed , and played together , they were always at home in time for their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 36]: Still , the young lady thought she preferred our hero , even to her brothers , and Jack thought that the young lady was the prettiest and kindest girl that he had ever met with .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 38]: At the end of the fortnight , our two midshipmen took their leave , furnished with letters of recommendation to many of the first nobility in Palermo , and mounted on two fine mules with bell bridles .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 47]: The old Donna kissed them both -- the Don showered down his blessings of good wishes , and Donna Agnes ' lips trembled as she bade them adieu ; and , as soon as they were gone , she went up to her chamber and wept .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 17]: Jack also was very grave , and his eyes moistened at the thoughts of leaving Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 20]: Neither of them were aware , until the hour of parting , how much they had wound themselves together .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 15]: The first quarter of an hour our two midshipmen followed their guide in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 15]: Jack wished to be left to his own thoughts , and Gascoigne perceived it .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 43]: `` Well , Easy , '' said Gascoigne , at last , `` if I had been in your place , constantly in company of , and loved by , that charming girl , I could never have torn myself away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 8]: `` Loved by her , Ned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 11]: replied Jack , `` what makes you say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 17]: `` Because I am sure it was the case ; she lived but in your presence .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 50]: Why , if you were out of the room , she never spoke a word , but sat there as melancholy as a sick monkey -- the moment you came in again , she beamed out as glorious as the sun , and was all life and spirit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 17]: `` I thought people were always melancholy when they were in love , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 13]: `` When those that they love are out of their presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 31]: `` Well , then , I am out of her presence , and I feel very melancholy , so I suppose , by your argument , I am in love .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 11]: Can a man be in love without knowing it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 24]: `` I really can not say , Jack ; I never was in love myself , but I 've seen many others spoony .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 10]: My time will come , I suppose , by-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 26]: They say , that for every man made , there is a woman also made to fit him , if he could only find her .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 25]: Now , it 's my opinion that you have found yours -- I 'll lay my life she 's crying at this moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 9]: `` Do you really think so , Ned ?
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 29]: let 's go back -- poor little Agnes -- let 's go back ; I feel I do love her , and I 'll tell her so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 5]: `` Pooh , nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 24]: it 's too late now ; you should have told her that before , when you walked with her in the garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 10]: `` But I did not know it , Ned .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 24]: However , as you say , it would be foolish to turn back , so I 'll write to her from Palermo . ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 32]: Here an argument ensued upon love , which we shall not trouble the reader with , as it was not very profound , both sides knowing very little on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 34]: It did , however , end with our hero being convinced that he was desperately in love , and he talked about giving up the service as soon as he arrived at Malta .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 15]: It is astonishing what sacrifices midshipmen will make for the objects of their adoration .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 15]: It was not until late in the evening that our adventurers arrived at Palermo .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 140]: As soon as they were lodged at the hotel , Gascoigne sat down and wrote a letter in their joint names to Don Rebiera , returning him many thanks for his great kindness , informing him of their safe arrival , and trusting that they should soon meet again : and Jack took up his pen , and indicted a letter in Spanish to Agnes , in which he swore that neither tide nor time , nor water , nor air , nor heaven , nor earth , nor the first lieutenant , nor his father , nor absence , nor death itself , should prevent him from coming back and marrying her , the first convenient opportunity , begging her to refuse a thousand offers , as come back he would , although there was no saying when .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 35]: It was a perfect love letter , that is to say , it was the essence of nonsense ; but that made it perfect , for the greater the love the greater the folly .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 23]: These letters were consigned to the man who was sent as their guide , and also had to return with the mules .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 52]: He was liberally rewarded ; and , as Jack told him to be very careful of his letter , the Italian naturally concluded that it was to be delivered clandestinely , and he delivered it accordingly , at a time when Agnes was walking in the garden thinking of our hero .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 62]: Nothing was more opportune than the arrival of the letter ; Agnes ran to the pavilion , read it over twenty times , kissed it twenty times , and hid it in her bosom ; sat for a few minutes in deep and placid thought , took the letter out of its receptacle , and read it over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 49]: It was very bad Spanish , and very absurd , but she thought it delightful , poetical , classical , sentimental , argumentative , convincing , incontrovertible , imaginative and even grammatical ; for if it was not good Spanish , there was no Spanish half so good .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 17]: Agnes was indeed unsophisticated , to be in such ecstasies with a midshipman 's love letter .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 20]: Once more she hastened to her room to weep , but it was from excess of joy and delight .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 24]: The reader may think Agnes silly , but he must take into consideration the climate , and that she was not yet fifteen .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 38]: Our young gentlemen sent for a tailor , and each ordered a new suit of clothes ; they delivered their letters of recommendation , and went to the banker to whom they were addressed by Don Rebiera .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 56]: `` I shall draw for ten pounds , Jack , '' said Gascoigne , `` on the strength of the shipwreck ; I shall tell the truth , all except that we forgot to ask for leave , which I shall leave out ; and I am sure the story will be worth ten pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 9]: What shall you draw for , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 26]: `` I shall draw for two hundred pounds , '' replied Jack ; `` I mean to have a good cruise while I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 11]: `` But will your Governor stand that , Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 8]: `` To be sure he will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 28]: `` Then you 're right -- he is a philosopher -- I wish he 'd teach mine , for he hates the sight of a bill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 15]: `` Then do n't you draw , Ned -- I have plenty for both .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 42]: If every man had his equal share and rights in the world , you would be as able to draw as much as I ; and as you can not , upon the principles of equality you shall have half . ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 26]: `` I really shall become a convert to your philosophy , Jack ; it does not appear to be so nonsensical as I thought it .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 26]: At all events , it has saved my old Governor ten pounds , which he can ill afford , as a colonel on half-pay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 29]: On their return to the inn , they found Don Philip and Don Martin , to whom Don Rebiera had written , who welcomed them with open arms .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 21]: They were two very fine young men of eighteen and nineteen , who were finishing their education in the army .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 15]: Jack asked them to dinner , and they and our hero soon became inseparable .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 68]: They took him to all the theatres , the conversaziones of all the nobility , and as Jack lost his money with good humour , and was a very handsome fellow , he was everywhere well received and was made much of : many ladies made love to him , but Jack was only very polite , because he thought more and more of Agnes every day .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 17]: Three weeks passed away like lightning , and neither Jack nor Gascoigne thought of going back .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 44]: At last , one fine day H.M. frigate Aurora anchored in the bay , and Jack and Gascoigne , who were at a party at the Duke of Pentaro 's , met with the captain of the Aurora , who was also invited .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 35]: The Duchess introduced them to Captain Tartar , who imagining them , from their being in plain clothes , to be young Englishmen of fortune on their travels , was very gracious and condescending .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 44]: Jack was so pleased with his urbanity that he requested the pleasure of his company to dinner the next day : Captain Tartar accepted the invitation , and they parted shaking hands , with many expressions of pleasure in having made his acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 12]: Jack 's party was rather large , and the dinner sumptuous .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 85]: The Sicilian gentlemen did not drink much wine : but Captain Tartar liked his bottle , and although the rest of the company quitted the table to go to a ball given that evening by the Marquesa Novara , Jack was too polite not to sit it out with the captain : Gascoigne closed his chair to Jack 's , who , he was afraid , being a little affected with the wine , would `` let the cat out of the bag . ''
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 6]: The captain was amazingly entertaining .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 55]: Jack told him how happy he should be to see him at Forest Hill , which property the captain discovered to contain six thousand acres of land , and also that Jack was an only son ; and Captain Tartar was quite respectful when he found that he was in such very excellent company .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 34]: The captain of the frigate inquired of Jack what brought him out here , and Jack , whose prudence was departing , told him that he came in his Majesty 's ship Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 30]: Gascoigne gave Jack a nudge , but it was of no use , for as the wine got into Jack 's brain , so did his notions of equality .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 15]: Wilson gave you a passage ; he 's an old friend of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 25]: `` So he is of ours , '' replied Jack ; `` he 's a devilish good sort of a fellow , Wilson . ''
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 12]: `` But where have you been since you came out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 4]: inquired Captain Tartar .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 20]: `` In the Harpy , '' replied Jack ; `` to be sure , I belong to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 6]: `` You belong to her !
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 9]: in what capacity , may I ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 12]: inquired Captain Tartar in a much less respectful and confidential tone .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 14]: `` Midshipman , '' replied Jack ; `` so is Mr Gascoigne . ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 3]: `` Umph !
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 7]: you are on leave then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 23]: `` No , indeed , '' replied Jack ; `` I 'll tell you how it is , my dear fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 29]: `` Excuse me for one moment , '' replied Captain Tartar , rising up ; `` I must give some directions to my servant which I forgot . ''
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 25]: Captain Tartar hailed his coxswain out of the window , gave orders just outside of the door , and then returned to the table .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 58]: In the meantime , Gascoigne , who expected a breeze , had been cautioning Jack , in a low tone , at intervals , when Captain Tartar 's back was turned : but it was useless ; the extra quantity of wine had got into Jack 's head , and he cared nothing for Gascoigne 's remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 31]: When the captain resumed his seat at the table , Jack gave him the true narrative of all that had passed , to which his guest paid the greatest attention .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 27]: Jack wound up his confidence by saying , that in a week or so he should go back to Don Rebiera and propose for Donna Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 15]: exclaimed Captain Tartar , drawing his breath with astonishment , and compressing his lip .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 21]: `` Tartar , the wine stands with you , '' said Jack , `` allow me to help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 32]: Captain Tartar threw himself back in his chair , and let all the air out of his chest with a sort of whistle , as if he could hardly contain himself .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 8]: `` Have you had wine enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 19]: said Jack , very politely ; `` if so , we will go to the Marquesa 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 18]: The coxswain came to the door , touched his hat to the captain , and looked significantly .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 87]: `` And so , sir , '' cried Captain Tartar , in a voice of thunder , rising from his chair , `` you 're a d -- d runaway midshipman , who , if you belonged to my ship , instead of marrying Donna Agnes , I would marry you to the gunner 's daughter , by G -- d ; two midshipmen sporting plain clothes in the best society in Palermo , and having the impudence to ask a post-captain to dine with them !
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 18]: To ask me and address me as ` Tartar , ' and ` my dear fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 6]: you infernal young scamps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 25]: continued Captain Tartar , now boiling with rage , and striking his fist on the table so as to set all the glasses waltzing .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 39]: `` Allow me to observe , sir , '' said Jack , who was completely sobered by the address , ` that we do not belong to your ship , and that we are in plain clothes . '
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 49]: `` In plain clothes -- midshipmen in mufti -- yes , you are so : a couple of young swindlers , without a sixpence in your pocket , passing yourselves off as young men of fortune , and walking off through the window without paying your bill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 16]: `` Do you mean to call me a swindler , sir , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 14]: `` Yes , sir , you -- '' `` Then you lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 7]: exclaimed our hero in a rage .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 21]: `` I am a gentleman , sir -- I am sorry I can not pay you the same compliment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 12]: The astonishment and rage of Captain Tartar took away his breath .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 32]: He tried to speak , but could not -- he gasped , and gasped , and then sat or almost fell down in his chair -- at last he recovered himself .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 6]: `` Matthews -- Matthews ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 15]: `` Sir , '' replied the coxswain , who had remained at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 7]: `` The sergeant of marines . ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 8]: `` Here he is , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 15]: The sergeant entered , and raised the back of his hand to his hat .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 12]: `` Bring your marines in -- take charge of these two .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 14]: Directly you are on board , put them both legs in irons . ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 16]: The marines with their bayonets walked in and took possession of our hero and Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 30]: `` Perhaps , sir , '' replied Jack , who was now cool again , `` you will permit us to pay our bill before we go on board .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 51]: We are no swindlers , and it is rather a heavy one -- or , as you have taken possession of our persons , you will , perhaps , do us the favour to discharge it yourself '' ; and Jack threw on the table a heavy purse of dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 22]: `` I have only to observe , Captain Tartar , that I wish to be very liberal to the waiters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 32]: `` Sergeant , let them pay their bill , '' said Captain Tartar in a more subdued tone , taking his hat and sword , and walking out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 11]: `` By heavens , Easy , what have you done ?
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 17]: -- you will be tried by a court-martial , and turned out of the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 19]: `` I hope so , '' replied Jack ; `` I was a fool to come into it .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 17]: But he called me a swindler , and I would give the same answer to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 38]: `` If you are ready , gentlemen , '' said the sergeant who had been long enough with Captain Tartar to be aware that to be punished by him was no proof of fault having been committed .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 22]: `` I will go and pack up our things , Easy , while you pay the bill , '' said Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 11]: `` Marine , you had better come with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 40]: In less than half an hour , our hero and his comrade , instead of finding themselves at the Marquesa 's ball , found themselves very comfortably in irons under the half-deck of his Majesty 's frigate , Aurora .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 25]: We shall leave them , and return to Captain Tartar , who had proceeded to the ball , to which he had been invited .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 25]: On his entering he was accosted by Don Martin and Don Philip , who inquired what had become of our hero and his friend .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 25]: Captain Tartar who was in no very good humour , replied briskly , `` that they were on board his ship in irons . ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 4]: `` In irons !
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 4]: for what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 4]: exclaimed Don Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 46]: `` Because , sir , they are a couple of young scamps who have introduced themselves into the best company , passing themselves off as people of consequence , when they are only a couple of midshipmen who have run away from their ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 36]: Now the Rebieras knew very well that Jack and his friend were midshipmen ; but this did not appear to them any reason why they should not be considered as gentlemen , and treated accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 60]: `` Do you mean to say , signor , '' said Don Philip , `` that you have accepted their hospitality , laughed , talked , walked arm-in-arm with them , pledged them in wine , as we have seen you this evening , and after they have confided in you that you have put them in irons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir , I do , '' replied Captain Tartar .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 18]: `` Then , by Heaven , you have my defiance , and you are no gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 7]: replied Don Philip , the elder .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 16]: `` And I repeat my brother 's words , sir , '' cried Don Martin .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 29]: The two brothers felt so much attachment for our hero , who had twice rendered such signal service to their family , that their anger was without bounds .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 35]: In every other service but the English navy there is not that power of grossly insulting and then sheltering yourself under your rank ; nor is it necessary for the discipline of any service .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 48]: To these young officers , if the power did exist , the use of such power under such circumstances appeared monstrous , and they were determined , at all events , to show to Captain Tartar that in society , at least , it could be resented .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 21]: They collected their friends , told them what had passed , and begged them to circulate it through the room .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 12]: This was soon done , and Captain Tartar found himself avoided .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 19]: He went up to the Marquesa and spoke to her , she turned her head the other way .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 52]: He addressed a count he had been conversing with the night before -- he turned short round upon his heel , while Don Philip and Don Martin walked up and down talking , so that he might hear what they said , and looking at him with eyes flashing with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 16]: Captain Tartar left the ballroom and returned to the inn , more indignant than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 36]: When he rose the next morning he was informed that a gentleman wished to speak with him ; he sent up his card as Don Ignatio Verez , colonel commanding the fourth regiment of infantry .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 40]: On being admitted , he informed Captain Tartar that Don Philip de Rebiera wished to have the pleasure of crossing swords with him , and requested to know when it would be convenient for Captain Tartar to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 37]: It was not in Captain Tartar 's nature to refuse a challenge ; his courage was unquestionable , but he felt indignant that a midshipman should be the cause of his getting into such a scrape .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 21]: He accepted the challenge , but having no knowledge of the small sword , refused to fight unless with pistols .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 33]: To this the colonel raised no objections , and Captain Tartar despatched his coxswain with a note to his second lieutenant , for he was not on good terms with his first .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 27]: The meeting took place -- at the first fire the ball of Don Philip passed through Captain Tartar 's brain , and he instantly fell dead .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 44]: The second lieutenant hastened on board to report the fatal result of the meeting , and shortly after , Don Philip and his brother , with many of their friends , went off in the Governor 's barge to condole with our hero .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 27]: The first lieutenant , now captain `` pro tempore , '' received them graciously , and listened to their remonstrances relative to our hero and Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 34]: `` I have never been informed by the captain of the grounds of complaint against the young gentlemen , '' replied he , `` and have therefore no charge to prefer against them .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 9]: I shall therefore order them to be liberated .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 46]: But as I learn that they are officers belonging to one of his Majesty 's ships lying at Malta , I feel it my duty , as I sail immediately , to take them there and send them on board of their own ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 43]: Jack and Gascoigne were then taken out of irons and permitted to see Don Philip , who informed them that he had revenged the insult , but Jack and Gascoigne did not wish to go on shore again after what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 34]: After an hour 's conversation , and assurances of continued friendship , Don Philip , his brother , and their friends , took leave of our two midshipmen , and rowed on shore .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 7]: And now we must be serious .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 43]: We do not write these novels merely to amuse , -- we have always had it in our view to instruct , and it must not be supposed that we have no other end in view than to make the reader laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 68]: If we were to write an elaborate work , telling truths , and plain truths , confining ourselves only to point out errors and to demand reform , it would not be read ; we have therefore selected this light and trifling species of writing , as it is by many denominated , as a channel through which we may convey wholesome advice in a palatable shape .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 41]: If we would point out an error , we draw a character , and although that character appears to weave naturally into the tale of fiction , it becomes as much a beacon as it is a vehicle of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 89]: We consider this to be the true art of novel writing , and that crime and folly and error can be as severely lashed as virtue and morality can be upheld , by a series of amusing causes and effects , that entice the reader to take a medicine , which , although rendered agreeable to the palate , still produces the same internal benefit , as if it had been presented to him in its crude state , in which it would either be refused or nauseated .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 58]: In our naval novels , we have often pointed out the errors which have existed , and still do exist , in a service which is an honour to its country ; for what institution is there on earth that is perfect , or into which , if it once was perfect , abuses will not creep ?
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 35]: Unfortunately , others have written to decry the service , and many have raised up their voices against our writings , because they felt that , in exposing error , we were exposing them .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 21]: But to this we have been indifferent ; we felt that we were doing good , and we have continued .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 26]: To prove that we are correct in asserting that we have done good , we will , out of several , state one single case .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 83]: In `` The King 's Own , '' a captain , when requested to punish a man instanter for a fault committed , replies that he never has and never will punish a man until twenty-four hours after the offence , that he may not be induced by the anger of the moment to award a severer punishment than in his cooler moments he might think commensurate and that he wished that the Admiralty would give out an order to that effect .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 60]: Some time after the publication of that work , the order was given by the Admiralty , forbidding the punishment until a certain time had elapsed after the offence ; and we had the pleasure of knowing from the first lord of the Admiralty of the time , that it was in consequence of the suggestion in the novel .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 102]: If our writings had effected nothing else , we might still lay down our pen with pride and satisfaction : but they have done more , much more ; and while they have amused the reader , they have improved the service : they have held up in their characters a mirror , in which those who have been in error may see their own deformity , and many hints which have been given have afterwards returned to the thoughts of those who have had an influence , have been considered as their own ideas , and have been acted upon .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 19]: The conduct of Captain Tartar may be considered as a libel on the service -- is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 35]: The fault of Captain Tartar was not in sending them on board , or even putting them in irons as deserters , although , under the circumstances , he might have shown more delicacy .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 38]: The fault was in stigmatising a young man as a swindler , and the punishment awarded to the error is intended to point out the moral , that such an abuse of power should be severely visited .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 54]: The greatest error now in our service , is the disregard shown to the feelings of the junior officers in the language of their superiors : that an improvement has taken place I grant , but that it still exists , to a degree injurious to the service , I know too well .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 40]: The articles of war , as our hero was informed by his captain , were equally binding on officers and crew ; but what a dead letter do they become if officers are permitted to break them with impunity !
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 53]: The captain of a ship will turn the hands up to punishment , read the article of war for the transgressing of which the punishment is inflicted , and to show at that time their high respect for the articles of war , the captain and every officer take off their hats .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 31]: The moment the hands are piped down , the second article of war , which forbids all swearing , etc , in derogation of God 's honour is immediately disregarded .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 36]: We are not strait-laced , -- we care little about an oath as a mere expletive ; we refer now to swearing at others , to insulting their feelings grossly by coarse and intemperate language .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 29]: We would never interfere with a man for d -- g his own eyes , but we deny the right of his d -- g those of another .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 35]: The rank of a master in the service is above that of a midshipman , but still the midshipman is a gentleman by birth , and the master , generally speaking , is not .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 50]: Even at this moment , in the service , if the master were to d -- n the eyes of a midshipman , and tell him that he was a liar , would there be any redress , or if so , would it be commensurate to the insult ?
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 14]: If a midshipman were to request a court-martial , would it be granted ?
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 3]: certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 14]: And yet this is a point of more importance than may be conceived .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 23]: Our service has been wonderfully improved since the peace , and those who are now permitted to enter it must be gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 97]: We know that even now there are many who cry out against this as dangerous , and injurious to the service ; as if education spoilt an officer , and the scion of an illustrious house would not be more careful to uphold an escutcheon without blemish for centuries than one who has little more than brute courage ; but those who argue thus are the very people who are injurious to the service , for they can have no other reason , except that they wish that the juniors may be tyrannised over with impunity .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 28]: Be it remembered that these are not the observations of a junior officer , smarting under insult -- they are the result of deep and calm reflection .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 73]: We have arrived to that grade , that , although we have the power to inflict , we are too high to receive insult , but we have not forgotten how our young blood has boiled when wanton , reckless , and cruel torture has been heaped upon our feelings , merely because , as a junior officer , we were not in a position to retaliate , or even to reply .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 12]: And another evil is , that this great error is disseminated .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 30]: In observing on it , in one of our works , called `` Peter Simple , '' we have put the following true observation in the mouth of O'Brien .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 59]: Peter observes , in his simple , right-minded way -- `` I should think , O'Brien , that the very circumstance of having had your feelings so often wounded by such language when you were a junior officer would make you doubly careful not to use it towards others , when you had advanced in the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 65]: `` Peter , that 's just the first feeling , which wears away after a time , till at last your own sense of indignation becomes blunted , and becomes indifferent to it : you forget , also , that you wound the feelings of others , and carry the habit with you , to the great injury and disgrace of the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 19]: Let it not be supposed that in making these remarks we want to cause litigation , or insubordination .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 43]: On the contrary , we assert that this error is the cause , and eventually will be much more the cause , of insubordination ; for as the junior officers who enter the service are improved , so will they resist it .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 88]: The complaint here is more against the officers than the captains , whose power has been perhaps already too much curtailed by late regulations : that power must remain , for although there may be some few who are so perverted as to make those whom they command uncomfortable , in justice to the service we are proud to assert , that the majority acknowledge , by their conduct , that the greatest charm attached to power is to be able to make so many people happy .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 16]: CHAPTER XXII Our hero is sick with the service , but recovers with proper medicine .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 14]: An argument , ending , as most do , in a blow up .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 5]: Mesty lectures upon craniology .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 53]: The day after the funeral , H.M. ship Aurora sailed for Malta , and on her arrival the acting captain sent our two midshipmen on board the Harpy without any remark , except `` victualled the day discharged , '' as they had been borne on the ship 's books as supernumeraries .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 27]: Mr James , who was acting in the Aurora , was anxious to join the Admiral at Toulon , and intended to sail the next day .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 110]: He met Captain Wilson at the Governor 's table , and stated that Jack and Gascoigne had been put in irons by order of Captain Tartar ; his suspicions , and the report , that the duel had in consequence taken place ; but Gascoigne and Jack had both agreed that they would not communicate the events of their cruise to anybody on board of the Aurora ; and therefore nothing else was known , except that they must have made powerful friends somehow or another ; and there appeared in the conduct of Captain Tartar , as well as in the whole transaction , somewhat of a mystery .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 52]: `` I should like to know what happened to my friend Jack , who fought the duel , '' said the Governor , who had laughed at it till he held his sides ; `` Wilson , do bring him here to-morrow morning , and let us have his story . ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 18]: `` I am afraid of encouraging him , Sir Thomas , he is much too wild already .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 8]: I told you of his first cruise .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 14]: He has nothing but adventures , and they all end too favourably . ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 35]: `` Well , but you can send for him here and blow him up just as well as in your own cabin , and then we will have the truth out of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 20]: `` That you certainly will , '' replied Captain Wilson , `` for he tells it plainly enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 11]: `` Well , to oblige me , send for him .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 22]: I do n't see he was much to blame in absconding , as it appears he thought he would be hung .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 8]: I want to see the lad . ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 43]: `` Well , Governor , if you wish it , '' replied Captain Wilson , who wrote a note to Mr Sawbridge , requesting he would send Mr Easy to him at the Governor 's house at ten o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 29]: Jack made his appearance in his uniform -- he did not much care for what was said to him , as he was resolved to leave the service .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 16]: He had been put in irons , and the iron had entered into his soul .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 27]: Mr Sawbridge had gone on shore about an hour before Jack had been sent on board , and he had remained on shore all the night .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 51]: He did not therefore see Jack but for a few minutes , and thinking it his duty to say nothing to him at first , or to express his displeasure , he merely observed to him that the captain would speak to him as soon as he came on board .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 51]: As Gascoigne and our hero did not know how far it might be safe , even at Malta , to acknowledge to what occurred on board the speronare , which might get wind , they did not even tell their messmates , resolving only to confide it to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 29]: When Jack was ushered into the presence of the captain , he found him sitting with the Governor , and the breakfast on the table ready for them .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 9]: Jack walked in with courage , but respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 14]: He was fond of Captain Wilson , and wished to show him respect .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 42]: Captain Wilson addressed him , pointed out that he had committed a great error in fighting a duel -- a greater error in demeaning himself by fighting the purser 's steward , and still greater in running away from his ship .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 31]: Jack looked respectfully to Captain Wilson , acknowledged that he had done wrong , and promised to be more careful another time , if Captain Wilson would look over it .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 33]: `` Captain Wilson , allow me to plead for the young gentleman , '' said the Governor ; `` I am convinced that it has only been an error in judgment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 29]: `` Well , Mr Easy , as you express your contrition , and the Governor interferes in your behalf , I shall take no more notice of this .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 47]: But recollect , Mr Easy , that you have occasioned me a great deal of anxiety by your mad pranks , and I trust another time you will remember that I am too anxious for your welfare not to be uncomfortable when you run such risks .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 33]: You may now go on board to your duty , and tell Mr. Gascoigne to do the same ; and pray let us hear of no more duels or running away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 43]: Jack , whose heart softened at this kind treatment , did not venture to speak ; he made his bow and was about to quit the room , when the Governor said -- `` Mr Easy , you have not breakfasted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 18]: `` I have , sir , '' replied Jack , `` before I came on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 32]: `` But a midshipman can always eat two breakfasts , particularly when his own comes first ; so sit down and breakfast with us -- it 's all over now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 26]: `` Even if it was not , '' replied Captain Wilson , laughing , `` I doubt whether it would spoil Mr Easy 's breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 9]: Come , Mr Easy , sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 20]: Jack bowed , and took his chair , and proved that his lecture had not taken away his appetite .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 43]: When breakfast was over , Captain Wilson observed -- `` Mr Easy , you have generally a few adventures to speak of when you return , will you tell the Governor and me what has taken place since you left us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 36]: `` Certainly , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` but I venture to request that it may be under the promise of secrecy , for it 's rather important to me and Gascoigne . ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 26]: `` Yes , if secrecy is really necessary , my boy ; but I 'm the best judge of that , '' replied the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 54]: Jack then entered into a detail of his adventures , which we have already described , much to the astonishment of the Governor and his captain , and concluded his narration by stating that he wanted to leave the service ; he hoped that Captain Wilson would discharge him and send him home .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 6]: `` Pooh , nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 16]: said the Governor , `` you sha n't leave the Mediterranean while I am here .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 19]: No , no -- you must have more adventures , and come back and tell them to me .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 36]: And recollect , my lad , that whenever you come to Malta , there is a bed at the Governor 's house , and a seat at his table , always ready for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 32]: `` You are very kind , Sir Thomas , '' replied Jack , `` but -- '' `` No buts at all , sir -- you sha n't leave the service !
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 20]: Besides , recollect that I can ask for leave of absence for you to go and see Donna Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 10]: Ay , and send you there , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 15]: Captain Wilson also remonstrated with our hero , and he gave up the point .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 17]: It was harsh treatment which made him form the resolution it was kindness which overcame it .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 22]: `` With your permission , Captain Wilson , Mr Easy shall dine with us to-day , and bring Gascoigne with him .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 16]: You shall first scold him , and I 'll console him with a good dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 14]: And , boy , do n't be afraid to tell your story everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 14]: Sit down and tell it at Nix Mangare stairs , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 6]: I 'm Governor here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 8]: Jack made his obeisance , and departed .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 26]: `` The lad must be treated kindly , Captain Wilson , '' said the Governor ; `` he would be a loss to the service .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 13]: Good heavens , what adventures , and how honestly he tells everything !
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 37]: I shall ask him to stay with me for the time you are here , if you will allow me : I want to make friends with him -- he must not leave the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 30]: Captain Wilson , who felt that kindness and attention would be more effectual with our hero than any other measures , gave his consent to the Governor 's proposition .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 27]: So Jack ate at the Governor 's table , and took lessons in Spanish and Italian until the Harpy had been refitted , after heaving down .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 34]: Before she was ready a vessel arrived from the fleet , directing Captain Wilson to repair to Mahon and send a transport , lying there , to procure live bullocks for the fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 32]: Jack did not join his ship very willingly , but he had promised the Governor to remain in the service , and he went on board the evening before she sailed .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 37]: He had been living so well that he had , at first , a horror of midshipman 's fare , but a good appetite seasons everything , and Jack soon complained that there was not enough .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 52]: He was delighted to see Jolliffe and Mesty after so long an absence ; he laughed at the boatswain 's cheeks , inquired after the purser 's steward 's shot-holes , shook hands with Gascoigne and his other messmates , gave Vigors a thrashing , and then sat down to supper .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 15]: `` Ah , Massa Easy , why you take a cruise without me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 8]: said Mesty ; `` dat very shabby .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 11]: By de power , but I wish I was there .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 15]: You ab too much danger , Massa Easy , without Mesty , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 14]: The next day the Harpy sailed , and Jack went to his duty .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 30]: Mr Asper borrowed ten pounds , and our hero kept as much watch as he pleased , which , as watching did not please him , was very little .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 50]: Mr Sawbridge had long conversations with our hero , pointing out to him the necessity of discipline and obedience in the service , and that there was no such thing as equality , and that the rights of man secured to everyone the property which he held in possession .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 31]: `` According to your ideas , Mr Easy , a man has no more right to his wife than anything else , and any other man may claim her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 50]: Jack thought of Agnes , and he made matrimony an exception , as he continued to argue the point ; but although he argued , still his philosophy was almost upset at the idea of any one disputing with him the rights of man , with respect to Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 66]: The Harpy made the African coast , the wind continued contrary , and they were baffled for many days ; at last they espied a brig under the land , about sixteen miles off ; her rig and appearance made Captain Wilson suspect that she was a privateer of some description or another , but it was calm , and they could not approach her .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 48]: Nevertheless Captain Wilson thought it his duty to examine her ; so at ten o'clock at night the boats were hoisted out : as this was merely intended for a reconnoitre , for there was no saying what she might be , Mr Sawbridge did not go .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 20]: Mr Asper was in the sick list , so Mr Smallsole the master had the command of the expedition .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 15]: Jack asked Mr Sawbridge to let him have charge of one of the boats .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 13]: Mr Jolliffe and Mr Vigors went in the pinnace with the master .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 19]: The gunner had the charge of one cutter , and our hero had the command of the other .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 30]: Jack , although not much more than seventeen , was very strong and tall for his age ; indeed he was a man grown , and shaved twice a-week .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 19]: His only object in going was to have a yarn for the Governor when he returned to Malta .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 39]: Mesty went with him , and , as the boat shoved off , Gascoigne slipped in , telling Jack that he was come to take care of him , for which considerate kindness Jack expressed his warmest thanks .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 44]: The orders to the master were very explicit ; he was to reconnoitre the vessel , and if she proved heavily armed not to attack , for she was embayed , and could not escape the Harpy as soon as there was wind .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 61]: If not armed he was to board her , but he was to do nothing till the morning : the reason for sending the boats away so soon was , that the men might not suffer from the heat of the sun during the daytime , which was excessive , and had already put many men on the sick list .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 30]: The boats were to pull to the bottom of the bay , not to go so near as to be discovered , and then drop their grapnels till daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 34]: The orders were given to Mr Smallsole in presence of the other officers who were appointed to the boats , that there might be no mistake , and the boats then shoved off .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 34]: After a three hours ' pull , they arrived to where the brig lay becalmed , and , as they saw no lights moving on board , they supposed they were not seen .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 14]: They dropped their grapnels in about seven fathoms water and waited for daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 67]: When Jack heard Captain Wilson 's orders that they were to lie at anchor till daylight , he had sent down Mesty for fishing-lines , as fresh fish is always agreeable in a midshipman 's berth : he and Gascoigne amused themselves this way , and as they pulled up the fish they entered into an argument , and Mr Smallsole ordered them to be silent .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 56]: The point which they discussed was relative to boat service ; Gascoigne insisted that the boats should all board at once -- while our hero took it into his head that it was better they should come up one after another ; a novel idea , but Jack 's ideas on most points were singular .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 33]: `` If you throw your whole force upon the decks at once , you overpower them , '' observed Gascoigne ; `` if you do not you are beaten in detail . ''
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 100]: `` Very true , '' replied Jack , `` supposing that you have an overpowering force , or they are not prepared ; but recollect , that if they are , the case is altered ; for instance , as to fire-arms -- they fire theirs at the first boat , and they have not time to re-load , when the second comes up with its fire reserved ; every fresh boat arriving adds to the courage of those who have boarded , and to the alarm of those who defend ; the men come on fresh and fresh .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 18]: Depend upon it , Gascoigne , there is nothing like a ` corps de reserve ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 18]: `` Will you keep silence in your boat , Mr Easy , or will you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 16]: cried the master ; `` you 're a disgrace to the service , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 15]: `` Thank ye , sir , '' replied Jack , in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 8]: `` I 've another bite Ned . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 14]: Jack and his comrade continued to fish in silence till the day broke .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 36]: The mist rolled off the stagnant water , and discovered the brig , who , as soon as she perceived the boats , threw out the French tricolour , and fired a gun of defiance .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 63]: Mr Smallsole was undecided ; the gun fired was not a heavy one , and so Mr Jolliffe remarked ; the men , as usual , anxious for the attack , asserted the same , and Mr Smallsole , afraid of retreating from the enemy and being afterwards despised by the ship 's company , ordered the boats to weigh their grapnels .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 23]: `` Stop a moment , my lads , '' said Jack to his men , `` I 've got a bite . ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 46]: The men laughed at Jack 's taking it so easy , but he was their pet ; and they did stop for him to pull up his fish , intending to pull up to the other boats and recover their loss of a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 26]: `` I 've hooked him now , '' said Jack ; `` you may up with the grapnel while I up with the fish . ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 27]: But this delay gave the other boats a start of a dozen strokes of their oars , which was a distance not easy to be regained .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 15]: `` They will be aboard before us , sir , '' said the coxswain .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 16]: `` Never mind that '' , replied Jack ; `` someone must be last . ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 21]: `` But not the boat I am in , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` if I could help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 33]: `` I tell you , '' replied Jack , `` we shall be the ` corps de reserve , ' and have the honour of turning the scale in our favour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 31]: `` Give way , my lads , '' cried Gascoigne , perceiving the other boats still kept their distance ahead of them , which was about a cable 's length .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 36]: `` Gascoigne , I command the boat , '' said Jack , `` and I do not wish my men to board without any breath in their bodies -- that 's a very unwise plan .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 14]: A steady pull , my lads , and not too much exertion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 15]: `` By heavens , they 'll take the vessel before we get alongside . ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 17]: `` Even if they should , I am right , am I not , Mesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 31]: `` Yes , Massa Easy , you very right -- suppose they take vessel without you , they no want you -- suppose they want you , you come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 21]: And the negro , who had thrown his jacket off , bared his arm , as if he intended mischief .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 30]: The first cutter , commanded by the gunner , now gained upon the launch , and was three boat 's - lengths ahead of her when she came alongside .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 18]: The brig poured in her broadside -- it was well directed , and down went the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 13]: `` Cutter 's sunk , '' exclaimed Gascoigne ; `` by heavens !
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 7]: give way , my men . ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 27]: `` Now , do n't you observe , that had we all three been pulling up together , the broadside would have sunk us all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 6]: said Jack , very composedly .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 25]: `` There 's board in the launch -- give way , my men , give way , '' said Gascoigne , stamping with impatience .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 65]: The reception was evidently warm ; by the time that the launch had poured in her men , the second cutter was close under the brig 's quarter -- two more strokes and she was alongside ; when of a sudden , a tremendous explosion took place on the deck of the vessel , and bodies and fragments were hurled up in the air .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 49]: So tremendous was the explosion , that the men of the second cutter , as if transfixed , simultaneously stopped pulling , their eyes directed to the volumes of smoke which poured through the ports , and hid the whole of the masts and rigging of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 20]: `` Now 's your time , my lads , give way , and alongside , '' cried our hero .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 21]: The men , reminded by his voice , obeyed -- but the impetus already given to the boat was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 34]: Before they could drop their oars in the water they grazed against the vessel 's sides , and , following Jack , were in a few seconds on the quarter-deck of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 36]: A dreadful sight presented itself -- the whole deck was black , and corpses lay strewed ; their clothes on them still burning , and among the bodies lay fragments of what once were men .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 24]: The capstern was unshipped and turned over on its side -- the binnacles were in remnants , and many of the ropes ignited .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 12]: There was not one person left on deck to oppose them .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 58]: As they afterwards learned from some of the men who had saved their lives by remaining below , the French captain had seen the boats before they anchored , and had made every preparation ; he had filled a large ammunition chest with cartridges for the guns , that they might not have to hand them up .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 46]: The conflict between the men of the pinnace and the crew of the vessel was carried on near the capstern , and a pistol fired had accidentally communicated with the powder , which blew up in the very centre of the dense and desperate struggle .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 44]: The first object was to draw water and extinguish the flames , which were spreading over the vessel ; as soon as that was accomplished , our hero went aft to the taffrail , and looked for the cutter which had been sunk .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 30]: `` Gascoigne , jump into the boat with four men -- I see the cutter floats a quarter of a mile astern : there may be someone alive yet .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 11]: I think now I see a head or two . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 31]: Gascoigne hastened away , and soon returned with three of the cutter 's men ; the rest had sunk , probably killed or wounded by the discharge of the broadside .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 10]: `` Thank God , there 's three saved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 11]: said Jack , `` for we have lost too many .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 30]: We must now see if any of these poor fellows are yet alive , and clear the decks of the remnants of those who have been blown to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 19]: I say , Ned , where should we have been if we had boarded with the pinnace ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 26]: `` You always fall upon your feet , Easy , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` but that does not prove that you are right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 19]: `` I see there 's no convincing you , Ned , you are so confoundedly fond of argument .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 24]: However , I 've no time to argue now -- we must look to these poor fellows ; some are still alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 31]: Body after body was thrown through the ports , the habiliments , in most cases , enabling them to distinguish whether it was that of a departed friend or foe .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 21]: Jack turned round , and observed Mesty with his foot on a head which had been blown from the trunk .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 9]: `` What are you about , Mesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 62]: `` Massa Easy , I look at dis , and I tink it Massa Vigors ' head , and den I tink dis skull of his enemy nice present make to little Massa Gossett ; and den I tink again , and I say , no , he dead and nebber thrash any more -- so let him go overboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 39]: Jack turned away , forgiving Vigors in his heart ; he thought of the petty animosities of a midshipman 's berth , as he looked at the blackened portion of a body half an hour before possessing intellect .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 61]: `` Massa Easy , '' said Mesty , `` I tink you say right , anyhow , when you say forgive : den , Massa Vigors , '' continued Mesty , taking up the head by the singed hair , and tossing it out of the port ; `` you really very bad man -- but Ashantee forgive you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 47]: `` Here 's somebody alive , '' said Gascoigne to Jack , examining a body , the face of which was black as a cinder and not to be recognised , `` and he is one of our men , too , by his dress . ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 29]: Our hero went up to examine , and to assist Gascoigne in disengaging the body from a heap of ropes and half-burnt tarpaulings with which it was entangled .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 68]: Mesty followed , and looking at the lower extremities said , `` Massa Easy , dat Massa Jolliffe ; I know him trousers ; marine tailor say he patch um for ever , and so old dat de thread no hold ; yesterday he had dis patch put in , and marine tailor say he be d -- n if he patch anymore , please nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 22]: Mesty was right ; it was poor Jolliffe , whose face was burnt as black as a coal by the explosion .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 40]: He had also lost three fingers of the left hand , but as soon as he was brought out on the deck he appeared to recover , and pointed to his mouth for water , which was instantly procured .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 29]: `` Mesty , '' said Jack , `` I leave you in charge of Mr Jolliffe ; take every care of him till I can come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 38]: The investigation was then continued , and four English sailors found who might be expected to recover , as well as about the same number of Frenchmen ; the remainder of the bodies were then thrown overboard .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 22]: The hat only of the master was picked up between the guns , and there were but eleven Frenchmen found below .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 26]: The vessel was the Franklin , a French privateer of ten guns and sixty-five men , of which , eight men were away in prizes .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 14]: The loss on the part of the vessel was forty-six killed and wounded .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 40]: On that of the Harpy , it was five drowned in the cutter , and eighteen blown up belonging to the pinnace , out of which total of twenty-three , they had only Mr Jolliffe and five seamen alive .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 19]: `` The Harpy is standing in with a breeze from the offing , '' said Gascoigne to Easy .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 32]: `` So much the better , for I am sick of this , Ned ; there is something so horrible in it , and I wish I was on board again .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 19]: I have just been to Jolliffe ; he can speak a little ; I think he will recover .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 28]: I hope so , poor fellow ; he will then obtain his promotion , for he is the commanding officer of all us who are left . ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 33]: `` And if he does , '' replied Gascoigne , `` he can swear that it was by having been blown up which spoilt his beauty -- but here comes the Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 34]: I have been looking for an English ensign to hoist over the French , but can not find one ; so I hoist a wheft over it , -- that will do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 25]: The Harpy was soon hove-to close to the brig , and Jack went on board in the cutter to report what had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 49]: Captain Wilson was much vexed and grieved at the loss of so many men : fresh hands were put in the cutter to man the pinnace , and he and Sawbridge both went on board to witness the horrible effects of the explosion as described by our hero .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 16]: Jolliffe and the wounded men were taken on board , and all of them recovered .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 60]: We have before stated how disfigured the countenance of poor Mr Jolliffe had been by the small-pox -- so severely was it burned that the whole of the countenance came off in three weeks like a mask , and every one declared that , seamed as it still was , Mr Jolliffe was better looking than he was before .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 31]: It may be as well here to state , that Mr Jolliffe not only obtained his promotion , but a pension for his wounds , and retired from the service .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 51]: He was still very plain , but as it was known that he had been blown up , the loss of his eye as well as the scars on his face were all put down to the same accident , and he excited interest as a gallant and maimed officer .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 14]: He married , and lived contented and happy to a good old age .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 9]: The Harpy proceeded with her prize to Mahon .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 47]: Jack , as usual , obtained a great deal of credit ; whether he deserved it , or whether , as Gascoigne observed , he always fell upon his feet , the reader may decide from our narrative ; perhaps there was a little of both .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 52]: The seamen of the Harpy , if summoned in a hurry , used very often to reply , `` Stop a minute , I 've got a bite '' : as for Jack , he often said to himself , `` I have a famous good yarn for the Governor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 31]: CHAPTER XXIIII Jack goes on another cruise -- Love and diplomacy -- Jack proves himself as clever for three , and upsets all the arrangements of the high contracting powers .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 22]: A few days after the arrival of the Harpy at Port Mahon a cutter came in with despatches from the Admiral .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 28]: Captain Wilson found that he was posted into the Aurora frigate , in which a vacancy had been made by the result of our hero 's transgressions .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 19]: Mr Sawbridge was raised to the rank of commander , and appointed to the command of the Harpy .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 39]: The Admiral informed Captain Wilson that he must detain the Aurora until the arrival of another frigate , hourly expected , and then she would be sent down to Mahon for him to take the command of her .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 25]: Further , he intimated that a supply of live bullocks would be very agreeable , and begged that he would send to Tetuan immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 42]: Captain Wilson had lost so many officers that he knew not whom to send : indeed , now he was no longer in command of the Harpy , and there was but one lieutenant and no master or master 's mate .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 26]: Gascoigne and Jack were the only two serviceable midshipmen , and he was afraid to trust them on any expedition in which expedition was required .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 8]: `` What shall we do , Sawbridge ?
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 13]: shall we send Easy or Gascoigne , or both , or neither ?
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 21]: -- for if the bullocks are not forthcoming , the Admiral will not let them off as we do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 41]: `` We must send somebody , Wilson , '' replied Captain Sawbridge , `` and it is the custom to send two officers , as one receives the bullocks on board , while the other attends to the embarkation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 16]: `` Well , then send both , Sawbridge , but lecture them well first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 36]: `` I do n't think they can get into any mischief there , '' replied Sawbridge ; `` and it 's such a hole that they will be glad to get away from it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 77]: Easy and Gascoigne were summoned , listened very respectfully to all Captain Sawbridge said , promised to conduct themselves with the utmost propriety , received a letter to the vice-consul , and were sent with their hammocks and chests in the cabin on board the Eliza , Ann , brig , of two hundred and sixteen tons , chartered by government -- the master and crew of which were all busy forward heaving up their anchors .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 53]: The master of the transport came aft to receive them : he was short , red-haired young man , with hands as broad as the flappers of a turtle ; he was broad-faced , broad-shouldered , well freckled , and pug-nosed ; but if not very handsome he was remarkably good humoured .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 34]: As soon as the chests and hammocks were on deck , he told them that when he could get the anchor up and make sail , he would give them some bottled porter .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 28]: Jack proposed that he should get the porter up , and they would drink it while he got the anchor up , as it would save time .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 29]: `` It may save time , mayhap , but it wo n't save porter , '' replied the master ; `` however , you shall have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 18]: He called the boy , ordered him to bring up the porter , and then went forward .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 24]: Jack made the boy bring up two chairs , put the porter on the companion hatch , and he and Gascoigne sat down .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 26]: The anchor was weighed , and the transport ran out under her foretopsail , as they were light-handed , and had to secure the anchor .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 88]: The transport passed within ten yards of the Harpy , and Captain Sawbridge , when he perceived the two midshipmen taking it so very easy , sitting in their chairs with their legs crossed , arms folded , and their porter before them , had a very great mind to order the transport to heave-to , but he could spare no other officer , so he walked away saying to himself , `` There 'll be another yarn for the Governor , or I 'm mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 33]: As soon as sail was made on the transport , the master , whose name was Hogg , came up to our hero , and asked him how he found the porter .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 63]: Jack declared that he never could venture an opinion upon the first bottle -- `` So , Captain Hogg , we 'll trouble you for a second '' -- after which they troubled him for a third -- begged for a fourth -- must drink his health in a fifth -- and finally pointed out the propriety of making up the half-dozen .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 36]: By this time they found themselves rather light-headed ; so , desiring Captain Hogg to keep a sharp look-out , and not to call them on any account whatever , they retired to their hammocks .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 55]: The next morning they awoke late ; the breeze was fresh and fair : they requested Captain Hogg not to consider the expense , as they would pay for all they ate and drank , and all he did , into the bargain , and promised him a fit-out when they got to Tetuan .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 33]: What with this promise and calling him captain , our hero and Gascoigne won the master 's heart , and being a very good tempered fellow , they did what they pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 38]: Jack also tossed a doubloon to the men for them to drink on their arrival , and all the men of the transport were in a transport at Jack 's coming to `` reign over them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 23]: It must be acknowledged that Jack 's reign was , for the most part of it , `` happy and glorious . ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 26]: At last they arrived at Tetuan , and our Pylades and Orestes went on shore to call upon the vice-consul , accompanied by Captain Hogg .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 9]: They produced their credentials , and demanded bullocks .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 42]: The vice-consul was a very young man , short and thin , and light-haired ; his father had held the situation before him , and he had been appointed his successor because nobody else had thought the situation worth applying for .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 14]: Nevertheless , Mr Hicks was impressed with the immense responsibility of his office .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 58]: It was , however , a place of some little emolument at this moment , and Mr Hicks had plenty on his hands besides his sister , who , being the only English lady there , set the fashion of the place , and usurped all the attention of the gentlemen mariners who occasionally came for bullocks .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 25]: But Miss Hicks knew her own importance , and had successively refused three midshipmen , one master 's mate , and an acting purser .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 49]: African bullocks were plentiful at Tetuan , but English ladies were scarce ; moreover , she had a pretty little fortune of her own , to wit , three hundred dollars in a canvas bag , left her by her father , and entirely at her own disposal .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 34]: Miss Hicks was very like her brother , except that she was more dumpling in her figure , with flaxen hair ; her features were rather pretty , and her skin very fair .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 45]: As soon as the preliminaries had been entered into , and arrangements made in a small room with bare walls , which Mr Hicks denominated his office , they were asked to walk into the parlour to be introduced to the vice-consul 's sister .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 18]: Miss Hicks tossed her head at the two midshipmen , but smiled most graciously at Captain Hogg .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 10]: She knew the relative ranks of midshipman and captain .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 57]: After a short time she requested the honour of Captain Hogg 's company to dinner , and begged that he would bring his midshipmen with him , at which Jack and Gascoigne looked at each other and burst out in a laugh , and Miss Hicks was very near rescinding the latter part of her invitation .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 29]: As soon as they were out of the house , they told the captain to go on board and get all ready whilst they walked round the town .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 55]: Having peeped into every part of it , and stared at Arabs , Moors , and Jews , till they were tired , they proceeded to the landing-place , where they met the captain , who informed them that he had done nothing , because the men were all drunk with Jack 's doubloon .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 22]: Jack replied that a doubloon would not last for ever , and that the sooner they drank it out the better .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 91]: They then returned to the vice-consul 's , whom they requested to procure for them fifty dozen of fowls , twenty sheep , and a great many other articles which might be obtained at the place ; for , as Jack said , they would live well going up to Toulon , and if there were any of the stock left they would give them to the Admiral , for Jack had taken the precaution to put his father 's philosophy once more to the proof before he quitted Mahon .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 72]: As Jack gave such a liberal order , and the vice-consul cheated him out of at least one-third of what he paid , Mr Hicks thought he could do no less than offer beds to our midshipmen as well as to Captain Hogg ; so , as soon as dinner was over , they ordered Captain Hogg to go on board and bring their things on shore , which he did .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 52]: As the time usual for transports remaining at Tetuan before they could be completed with bullocks was three weeks , our midshipmen decided upon staying at least so long if they could find anything to do ; or if they could not , doing nothing was infinitely preferable to doing duty .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 89]: So they took up their quarters at the vice-consul 's , sending for porter and other things which were not to be had but from the transport ; and Jack , to prove that he was not a swindler , as Captain Tartar had called him , gave Captain Hogg a hundred dollars on account , for Captain Hogg had a large stock of porter and English luxuries , which he had brought out as a venture , and of which he had still a considerable portion left .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 21]: As , therefore , our midshipmen not only were cheated by the vice-consul , but they also supplied his table .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 83]: Mr Hicks was very hospitable , and everything was at their service except Miss Julia , who turned up her nose at a midshipman , even upon full pay ; but she made great advances to the captain , who , on his part , was desperately in love : so the mate and the men made all ready for the bullocks , Jack and Gascoigne made themselves comfortable , and Captain Hogg made love , and thus passed the first week .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 65]: The chamber of Easy and Gascoigne was at the top of the house , and finding it excessively warm , Gascoigne had forced his way up to the flat roof above -LRB- for the houses are all built in that way in most Mahomedan countries , to enable the occupants to enjoy the cool of the evening , and sometimes to sleep there -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 31]: Those roofs , where houses are built next to each other , are divided by a wall of several feet , to insure that privacy which the Mahomedan customs demand .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 33]: Gascoigne had not been long up there before he heard the voice of a female , singing a plaintive air in a low tone , on the other side of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 31]: Gascoigne sang well himself , and having a very fine ear , he was pleased with the correctness of the notes , although he had never heard the air before .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 13]: He leant against the wall , smoked his cigar , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 28]: It was repeated again and again at intervals ; Gascoigne soon caught the notes , which sounded so clear and pure in the silence of the night .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 30]: At last they ceased , and having waited another half-hour in vain , our midshipman returned to his bed , humming the air which had so pleased his ear .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 30]: It haunted him during his sleep , and rang in his ears when he awoke , as it is well known any new air that pleases us will do .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 21]: Before breakfast was ready , Gascoigne had put English words to it , and sang them over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 72]: He inquired of the vice-consul who lived in the next house , and was answered , that it was an old Moor , who was reported to be wealthy , and to have a daughter , whom many of the people had asked in marriage , but whether for her wealth or for her beauty he could not tell ; he had , however , heard that she was very handsome .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 28]: Gascoigne made no further inquiries , but went out with Jack and Captain Hogg , and on board to see the water got in for the bullocks .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 11]: `` Where did you pick up that air , Gascoigne ?
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 15]: It is very pretty , but I never heard you sing it before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 14]: Gascoigne told him , and also what he had heard from Mr Hicks .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 15]: `` I am determined , Jack , to see that girl if I can .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 46]: Hicks can talk Arabic fast enough ; just ask him the Arabic for these words -- ` Do n't be afraid -- I love you -- I can not speak your tongue ' , and put them down on paper as they are pronounced . ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 13]: Jack rallied Gascoigne upon his fancy , which could end in nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 26]: `` Perhaps not , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` and I should have cared nothing about it , if she had not sung so well .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 35]: I really believe the way to my heart is through my ear ; -- however , I shall try to-night , and soon find if she has the feeling which I think she has .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 30]: Now let us go back ; I 'm tired of looking at women with garments up to their eyes , and men in dirt up to their foreheads . ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 15]: As they entered the house they heard an altercation between Mr and Miss Hicks .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 27]: `` I shall never give my consent , Julia ; one of those midshipmen you turn your nose up at is worth a dozen Hoggs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 34]: `` Now , if we only knew the price of a hog in this country , '' observed Easy , `` we should be able to calculate our exact value , Ned . ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 20]: `` A hog , being an unclean animal , is not -- '' `` Hush , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 28]: `` Mr Hicks , '' replied Miss Julia , `` I am mistress of myself and my fortune , and I shall do as I please . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 11]: `` Depend upon it , you shall not , Julia .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 35]: I consider it my duty to prevent you from making an improper match : and , as his Majesty 's representative here , I can not allow you to marry this young man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 6]: `` Mercy on us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 10]: said Gascoigne , `` his Majesty 's representative ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 13]: `` I shall not ask your consent , '' replied the lady .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 12]: `` Yes , but you shall not marry without my consent .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 48]: I have , as you know , Julia , from my situation here , as one of his Majesty 's ` corps diplomatick , ' great power , and I shall forbid the banns ; in fact , it is only I who can marry you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 8]: `` Then I 'll marry elsewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 20]: `` And what will you do on board of the transport until you are able to be married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 28]: `` I shall do as I think proper , '' replied the lady ; `` and I 'll thank you for none of your indelicate insinuations . ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 32]: So saying , the lady bounced out of the room into her own , and our midshipmen then made a noise in the passage to intimate that they had come in .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 70]: They found Mr Hicks looking very red and vice-consular indeed , but he recovered himself ; and Captain Hogg making his appearance , they went to dinner ; but Miss Julia would not make her appearance , and Mr Hicks was barely civil to the captain , but he was soon afterwards called out , and our midshipmen went into the office to enable the two lovers to meet .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 22]: They were heard then talking together , and after a time they said less , and their language was more tender .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 38]: `` Let us see what 's going on , Jack , '' said Gascoigne ; and they walked softly , so as to perceive the two lovers , who were too busy to be on the look-out .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 12]: Captain Hogg was requesting a lock of his mistress 's hair .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 54]: The plump Julia could deny him nothing ; she let fall her flaxen tresses , and taking out the scissors cut off a thick bunch from her hair behind , which she presented to the captain ; it was at least a foot and a half long , and an inch in circumference .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 49]: The captain took it in his immense hand , and thrust it into his coat-pocket behind , but one thrust down to the bottom would not get it in , so he thrust again and again until it was all coiled away like a cable in a tier .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 25]: `` That 's a liberal girl , '' whispered Jack , `` she gives by wholesale what it will take some time to retail .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 36]: But here comes Mr Hicks , let 's give them warning ; I like Hogg , and as she fancies pork , she shall have it , if I can contrive to help them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 48]: That night Gascoigne went again on the roof , and after waiting some time heard the same air repeated : he waited until it was concluded , and then , in a very low tone , sung it himself to the words he had arranged for it .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 22]: For some time all was silent , and then the singing recommenced , but it was not to the same air .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 30]: Gascoigne waited until the new air had been repeated several times , and then , giving full scope to his fine tenor voice , sang the first air again .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 36]: It echoed through the silence of the night air , and then he waited , but in vain ; the soft voice of the female was heard no more , and Gascoigne retired to rest .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 54]: This continued for three or four nights , Gascoigne singing the same airs the ensuing night that he had heard the preceding , until at last it appeared that the female had no longer any fear , but changed the airs so as to be amused with the repetition of them next evening .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 34]: On the fifth night she sang the first air , and our midshipman responding , she then sang another , until she had sung them all , waiting each time for the response .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 30]: The wall was not more than eight feet high , and Gascoigne now determined , with the assistance of Jack , to have a sight of his unknown songstress .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 33]: He asked Captain Hogg to bring on shore some inch line , and he contrived to make a ladder with three or four poles which were upstairs , used for drying linen .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 15]: He fixed them against the wall without noise , all ready for the evening .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 18]: It was a beautiful , clear moonlight night , when he went up , accompanied by Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 65]: The air was again sung , and repeated by Gascoigne , who then softly mounted the ladder , held by Jack , and raised his head above the wall ; he perceived a young Moorish girl , splendidly dressed , half-lying on an ottoman , with her eyes fixed upon the moon , whose rays enabled him to observe that she was indeed beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 19]: She appeared lost in contemplation ; and Gascoigne would have given the world to have divined her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 41]: Satisfied with what he had seen , he descended , and singing one of the airs , he then repeated the words , `` Do not be afraid -- I love you -- I can not speak your language . ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 27]: He then sang another of the airs , and after he had finished he again repeated the words in Arabic ; but there was no reply .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 26]: He sang the third air , and again repeated the words , when , to his delight , he heard an answer in Lingua Franca .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 9]: `` Can you speak in this tongue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' replied Gascoigne , `` I can , Allah be praised !
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 9]: Be not afraid -- I love you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 10]: `` I know you not ; who are you ?
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 8]: you are not of my people . ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 12]: `` No , but I will be anything that you wish .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 11]: I am a Frank , and an English officer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 10]: At this reply of Gascoigne there was a pause .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 7]: `` Am I then despised ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 3]: said Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 30]: `` No , not despised ; but you are not of my people , or of my land ; speak no more , or you will be heard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 23]: `` I obey , '' replied Gascoigne , `` since you wish it ; but I shall pine till to-morrow 's moon .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 7]: I go to dream of you .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 5]: Allah protect you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 24]: `` How amazingly poetical you were in your language , Ned , '' said Easy , when they went down into their room .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 14]: `` To be sure , Jack , I 've read the Arabian Nights .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 16]: You never saw such eyes in your life ; what a houri she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 11]: `` Is she as handsome as Agnes , Ned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 8]: `` Twice as handsome by moonlight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 21]: `` That 's all moonshine , and so will be your courting , for it will come to nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 9]: `` Not if I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 14]: `` Why , Gascoigne , what would you do with a wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 11]: `` Just exactly what you would do , Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 15]: `` I mean , my dear Ned , can you afford to marry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 19]: `` Not while the old Governor lives , but I know he has some money in the funds .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 16]: He told me one day that I could not expect more than three thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 7]: You know I have sisters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 15]: `` And before you come into that you 'll have three thousand children . ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 24]: `` That 's a large family , Jack , '' replied Gascoigne , bursting out into laughter , in which our hero joined .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 16]: `` Well , you know I only wanted to argue the point with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 7]: `` I know that , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 18]: But I think we 're counting our chickens before they are hatched , which is foolish . ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 13]: `` In every other case except when we venture upon matrimony . ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 12]: `` Why , Jack , you 're becoming quite sensible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 13]: `` My wisdom is for my friends , my folly for myself .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 3]: Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 8]: But Jack did not go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 17]: `` I must not allow Gascoigne to do such a foolish thing , '' thought he .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 24]: `` Marry a dark girl on midshipman 's pay , if he succeeds -- get his throat cut if he does not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 25]: As Jack said , his wisdom was for his friends , and he was so generous that he reserved none for his own occasions .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 24]: Miss Julia Hicks , as we before observed , set the fashions at Tetuan , and her style of dress was not unbecoming .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 43]: The Moorish women wore large veils , or they may be called what you will , for their head-dresses descend to their heels at times and cover the whole body , leaving an eye to peep with , and hiding everything else .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 42]: Now Miss Hicks found this much more convenient than the bonnet , as she might walk out in the heat of the sun without burning her fair skin , and stare at everybody and everything without being stared at in return .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 19]: She therefore never went out without one of these overalls , composed of several yards of fine muslin .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 68]: Her dress in the house was usually of coloured sarcenet , for a small vessel came into the port one day during her father 's lifetime , unloaded a great quantity of bales of goods with English marks , and , as the vessel had gone out in ballast , there was a surmise on his part by what means they came into the captain 's possession .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 33]: He therefore cited the captain up to the Governor , but the affair was amicably arranged by the vice-consul receiving about one quarter of the cargo in bales of silks and muslins .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 69]: Miss Hicks had therefore all her dresses of blue , green , and yellow sarcenet , which , with the white muslin overall , made her as conspicuous as the only Frankish lady in the town had a right to be , and there was not a dog which barked in Tetuan which did not know the sister of the vice-consul , although few had seen her face .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 34]: Now it occurred to Jack , as Gascoigne was determined to carry on his amour , that in case of surprise it would be as well if he dressed himself as Miss Hicks .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 69]: He proposed it to Gascoigne the next morning , who approved of the idea , and in the course of the day , when Miss Hicks was busy with Captain Hogg , he contrived to abstract one of her dresses and muslin overalls , which he could do in safety , as there were plenty of them , for Miss Hicks was not troubled with mantua-makers ' bills .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 36]: When Gascoigne went up on the roof the ensuing night , he put on the apparel of Miss Hicks , and looked very like her as far as figure went , although a little taller .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 39]: He waited for the Moorish girl to sing , but she did not ; so he crept up the ladder and looked over the wall , when he observed that she was reclining as before in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 19]: His head , covered with the muslin , caught her eye , and she gave a faint scream .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 25]: `` Fear not , lady , '' said Gascoigne , `` it is not the first time that I have beheld that sweet face .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 6]: I sigh for a companion .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 12]: What would I not give to be sitting by your side !
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 25]: I am not of your creed , 't is true , but does it therefore follow that we should not love each other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 22]: The Moorish girl was about to reply , when Gascoigne received an answer from a quarter whence he little expected it .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 23]: It was from the Moor himself , who , hearing his daughter 's scream , had come swiftly up to the roof .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 16]: `` Does the Frankish lily wish to mingle her perfumes with the dark violet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 36]: said he ; for he had often seen the sister of the vice-consul , and he imagined it was she who had come on the roof and ascended the wall to speak with his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 13]: Gascoigne had presence of mind to avail himself of this fortunate mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 27]: `` I am alone , worthy Moor , '' replied he , pulling the muslin over his face , `` and I pine for a companion .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 35]: I have been charmed by the nightingale on the roof of your dwelling ; but I thought not to meet the face of a man when I took courage to climb this ladder . ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 23]: `` If the Frankish lily will have courage to descend , she can sit by the side of the dark violet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 9]: Gascoigne thought it advisable to make no reply .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 21]: `` Fear not , '' said the old Moor ; `` what is an old man but a woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 14]: and the Moor brought a ladder , which he placed against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 33]: After a pause Gascoigne said , `` It is my fate '' ; and he then descended , and was led by the Moor to the mattress upon which his daughter reclined .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 15]: The Moor then took his seat near them , and they entered into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 85]: Gascoigne knew quite enough of the vice-consul and his sister to play his part , and he thought proper to tell the Moor that her brother wished to give her as wife to the captain of the ship , whom she abhorred , and would take her to a cold and foggy climate ; that she had been born here , and wished to live and die here , and would prefer passing her life in his women 's apartments to leaving this country .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 16]: At which , Abdel Faza , for such was his name , felt very amorous .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 35]: He put his hand to his forehead , salaamed , and told Gascoigne that his zenana , and all that were in it , were hers , as well as his house and himself .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 65]: After an hour 's conversation , in which Azar , his daughter , did not join , the old Moor asked Gascoigne to descend into the women 's apartment ; and observing his daughter 's silence , said to her -- `` Azar , you are angry that this Frankish houri should come to the apartments of which you have hitherto been sole mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 29]: Fear not , you will soon be another 's , for Osman Ali has asked thee for his wife , and I have listened to his request . ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 15]: Now Osman Ali was as old as her father , and Azar hated him .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 13]: She offered her hand tremblingly , and led Gascoigne into the zenana .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 14]: The Moor attended them to the threshold , bowed , and left them .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 42]: That Gascoigne had time to press his suit , and that he did not lose such a golden opportunity , may easily be imagined , and her father 's communication relative to Osman Ali very much assisted our midshipman 's cause .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 22]: He left the zenana , like most midshipmen , in love ; that is , a little above quicksilver boiling heat .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 41]: Jack , who had remained in a state of some suspense all this time , was not sorry to hear voices in an amicable tone , and in a few minutes afterwards he perceived that Gascoigne was ascending the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 33]: It occurred to our hero that it was perhaps advisable that he should not be seen , as the Moor in his gallantry might come up the ladder with his supposed lady .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 34]: He was right , for Abdel Faza not only followed her up the ladder on his side but assisted her to descend on the other , and with great ceremony took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 37]: Gascoigne hastened to Jack , who had been peeping , and gave him a detail of what had passed , describing Azar as the most beautiful , fascinating , and fond creature that ever was created .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 19]: After half an hour 's relation he stopped short , because he discovered that Jack was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 35]: The visits of Gascoigne were repeated every night ; old Abdel Faza became every time more gallant , and our midshipman was under the necessity of assuming a virtue if he had it not .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 7]: He pretended to be very modest .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 14]: In the meantime Captain Hogg continued his attentions to the real Miss Hicks .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 60]: The mate proceeded to get the bullocks on board , and as more than three weeks had already passed away , it was time to think of departing for Toulon ; but Captain Hogg was too much in love ; and as for Gascoigne , he intended , like all midshipmen in love , to give up the service .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 33]: Jack reasoned with the captain , who appeared to listen to reason , because Miss Hicks had agreed to follow his fortunes , and crown his transports in the transport Mary Ann .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 41]: He therefore proposed that they should get away as fast as they could , and as soon as they had weighed the anchor he would come on shore , take off Miss Hicks , and make all sail for Toulon .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 24]: Jack might have suffered this ; the difficulty was with Gascoigne , who would not hear of going away without his lovely Azar .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 24]: At last Jack planned a scheme which he thought would succeed , and which would be a good joke to tell the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 24]: He therefore appeared to consent to Gascoigne 's carrying off his little Moor , and they canvassed how it was to be managed .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 15]: Jack then told Gascoigne that he had hit upon a plan which would succeed .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 59]: `` I find , '' said he , `` from Captain Hogg , that he has an intention of carrying off Miss Hicks , and when I sounded him as to his having a lady with him , he objected to it immediately , saying , that he must have all the cabin to himself and his intended .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 23]: Now , in the first place , I have no notion of giving up the cabin to Miss Hicks or Mrs Hogg .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 30]: It will be very uncomfortable to be shut out , because he wishes to make love ; I therefore am determined that he shall not take off Miss Hicks .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 47]: He has proposed to me that he shall go on board , and get the brig under way , leaving me with a boat on shore to sign the vouchers , and that Miss Hicks shall slip into the boat when I go off at dusk .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 27]: Now I will not bring off Miss Hicks ; if he wants to marry her , let him do it when I am not on board .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 14]: I have paid for everything , and I consider the cabin as mine .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 98]: `` Look you , Ned , if you wish to carry off your little Moor , there is but one way , and that is a very simple one ; leave her a dress of Miss Hicks 's when you go there to-morrow night , and tell her to slip down at dusk , and come out of the house : all the danger will be in her own house , for as soon as she is out , she will be supposed to be the vice-consul 's sister , and will not be observed or questioned .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 15]: I will look out for and bring her on board instead of Miss Hicks .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 51]: Hogg will have the brig under way , and will be too happy to make all sail , and she shall lock the cabin inside , so that the mistake shall not be discovered till the next morning , and we shall have a good laugh at Captain Hogg . ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 30]: Gascoigne pronounced that Jack 's scheme was capital , and agreed to it , thanking him , and declaring that he was the best friend that he ever had .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 21]: `` So I will be , '' thought Jack , `` but you will not acknowledge it at first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 54]: Jack then went to Captain Hogg , and appeared to enter warmly into his views , but told him that Hicks suspected what was going on , and had told him so , at the same time declaring that he would not lose sight of his sister until after Hogg was on board .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 57]: `` Now , '' says Jack , `` you know you can not do the thing by main force ; so the best plan will be for you to go on board and get under way , leaving me to bring off Miss Hicks , when her brother will imagine all danger to be over . ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 28]: `` Many thanks , Mr Easy , '' replied Captain Hogg ; `` it will be capital , and I 'll arrange it all with my Sophy .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 7]: How very kind of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 12]: `` But , Hogg , will you promise me secrecy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 33]: `` That Gascoigne is a very silly fellow , and wants to run away with a girl he has made acquaintance with here ; and what do you think he has proposed ?
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 38]: that after the ship was under way , that I shall carry her off in the boat ; and he has borrowed one of the dresses of Miss Hicks , that it may appear to be her .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 110]: I have agreed to it , but as I am determined that he shall not commit such a folly , I shall bring off Miss Hicks instead ; and , observe , Hogg , he is that sort of wild fellow , that if he was to find that I had cheated him , he would immediately go on shore and be left behind ; therefore we must hand Miss Hicks down in the cabin , and she will lock the door all night , so that he may not observe the trick till the next morning , and then we shall have a fine laugh at him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 16]: Captain Hogg replied it would be an excellent joke , as Gascoigne did before him .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 75]: Now it must be observed , that the water and the bullocks , and the sheep and fowls , were all on board ; and Mr Hicks , having received his money from Jack , had very much altered his manner ; he was barely civil , for as he had got all he could out of our hero , he was anxious to get rid of him as well as of Captain Hogg .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 66]: Our hero was very indignant at this , but as it would not suit his present views , pretended not to notice it -- on the contrary , he professed the warmest friendship for the vice-consul , and took an opportunity of saying that he could not return his kindness in a better way than by informing him of the plot which had been arranged .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 24]: He then told him of the intended escape of his sister , and that he was the person intended to bring her off .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 7]: `` Infamous , by heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 17]: cried the vice-consul ; `` I shall write to the foreign office on the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 37]: `` I think , '' said Jack , `` it will be much better to do what I shall propose , which will end in a hearty laugh , and to the confusion of Captain Hogg .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 20]: Do you dress yourself in your sister 's clothes , and I will bring you off instead of her .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 26]: Let him imagine that he has your sister secure ; I will hand you down to the cabin , and do you lock yourself in .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 16]: He can not sail without my orders , and I will not sign the vouchers .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 16]: The next morning we will open the cabin-door and have a good laugh at him .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 25]: Desire your boat to be off at daylight to take you on shore , and I will then make him proceed to Toulon forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 8]: It will be a capital joke . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 13]: So thought the vice-consul , as well as Gascoigne and Captain Hogg .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 15]: He shook hands with Jack , and was as civil to him as before .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 37]: That night Gascoigne left one of Miss Hicks 's many dresses with Azar , who agreed to follow his fortunes , and who packed up all the jewels and money she could lay her hands upon .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 11]: Poor little child , she trembled with fear and delight .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 27]: Miss Hicks smuggled , as she thought , a box of clothes on board , and in the box was her fortune of three hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 26]: Mr Hicks laughed in his sleeve , so did Jack ; and every one went to bed with expectations that their wishes would be realised .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 38]: After an early dinner , Captain Hogg and Gascoigne went on board , both squeezing Jack 's hand as if they were never to see him again , and looks of intelligence passed between all the parties .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 64]: As soon as they were out of the door the vice-consul chuckled and Miss Hicks , who thought he chuckled at the idea of having rid himself of Captain Hogg , chuckled still more as she looked at our hero , who was her confidant ; and our hero , for reasons known to the reader , chuckled more than either of them .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 53]: A little before dark , the boat was sent on shore from the brig , which was now under way , and Mr Hicks , as had been agreed , said that he should go into the office and prepare the vouchers -- that is , put on his sister 's clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 120]: Miss Hicks immediately rose , and wishing our hero a pleasant voyage , as had been agreed , said that she should retire for the night , as she had a bad headache -- she wished her brother good-night , and went into her room to wait another hour , when our hero , having shoved off the boat to deceive the vice-consul , was to return , meet her in the garden , and take her off to the brig. Our hero then went into the office and assisted the vice-consul , who took off all his own clothes and tied them up in a handkerchief , intending to resume them after he had gone into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 22]: As soon as he was ready , Jack carried his bundle and led the supposed Miss Hicks down to the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 21]: They shoved off in a great hurry , and Jack took an opportunity of dropping Mr Hicks 's bundle overboard .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 46]: As soon as they arrived alongside , Mr Hicks ascended , and was handed by Jack down into the cabin : he squeezed Jack 's hand as he entered , saying in a whisper , `` To-morrow morning what a laugh we shall have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 7]: and then he locked the door .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 38]: In the meantime the boat was hooked on and hoisted up , and Jack took the precaution to have the dead lights lowered , that Mr Hicks might not be able to ascertain what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 11]: Gascoigne came up to our hero and squeezed his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 11]: `` I 'm so much obliged to you , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 13]: I say , to-morrow morning what a laugh we shall have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 55]: As soon as the boat was up , and the mainyard filled , Captain Hogg also came up to our hero , shaking him by the hand and thanking him ; and he too concluded by saying , `` I say , Mr Easy , to-morrow morning what a laugh we shall have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 11]: `` Let those laugh who win , '' thought Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 33]: The wind was fair , the watch was set , the course was steered , and all went down to their hammocks , and went to sleep , waiting for to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 36]: Mr Hicks , also , having nothing better to do , went to sleep , and by the morning dawn , the transport Mary Ann was more than a hundred miles from the African shore .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 9]: CHAPTER XXIV Our hero plays the very devil .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 16]: We must leave the reader to imagine the effect of the next morning 's denouement .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 14]: Everyone was in a fury except Jack , who did nothing but laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 42]: The captain wanted to return to obtain Miss Hicks , Gascoigne to obtain Azar , and the vice-consul to obtain his liberty -- but the wind was foul for their return , and Jack soon gained the captain on his side .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 95]: He pointed out to him that , in the first place , if he presumed to return , he would forfeit his charter bond ; in the second , he would have to pay for all the bullocks that died ; in the third , that if he wished to take Miss Hicks as his wife , he must not first injure her character by having her on board before the solemnity ; and lastly , that he could always go and marry her whenever he pleased ; the brother could not prevent him .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 24]: All this was very good advice , and the captain became quite calm and rational , and set his studding-sails below and aloft .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 31]: As for Gascoigne , it was no use reasoning with him , so it was agreed that he should have satisfaction as soon as they could get on shore again .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 33]: Mr Hicks was the most violent ; he insisted that the vessel should return , while both Jack and the captain refused , although he threatened them with the whole foreign office .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 22]: He insisted upon having his clothes , but Jack replied that they had tumbled overboard as they pulled from the shore .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 24]: He then commanded the mate and men to take the vessel back , but they laughed at him and his woman 's clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 25]: `` At all events , I 'll have you turned out of the service , '' said he to our hero in his fury .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 45]: `` I shall be extremely obliged to you , '' said Jack -- and Captain Hogg was so much amused with the vice-consul 's appearance in his sister 's clothes , that he quite forgot his own disappointment in laughing at his intended brother-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 21]: He made friends again with Jack , who regained his ascendancy , and ordered out the porter on the capstern-head .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 66]: They had an excellent dinner , but Mr Hicks refused to join them , which however did not spoil the appetite of Jack or the captain : as for Gascoigne , he could not eat a mouthful , but he drank to excess , looking over the rim of his tumbler , as if he could devour our hero , who only laughed the more .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 24]: Mr Hicks had applied to the men to lend him some clothes , but Jack had foreseen that , and he was omnipotent .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 18]: There was not a jacket or a pair of trousers to be had for love or money .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 42]: Mr Hicks then considered it advisable to lower his tone , and he applied to Captain Hogg , who begged to be excused without he consented to his marriage with his sister , to which Mr Hicks gave an indignant negative .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 21]: He then applied to Gascoigne , who told him in a very surly tone to go to h -- l .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 23]: At last he applied to our hero , who laughed , and said that he would see him d -- d first .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 12]: So Mr Hicks sat down in his petticoats and vowed revenge .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 29]: Gascoigne , who had drunk much and eaten nothing , turned in and went to sleep -- while Captain Hogg and our hero drank porter on the capstern .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 37]: Thus passed the first day , and the wind was famously fair -- the bullocks lowed , the cocks crew , the sheep baa 'd , and the Mary Ann made upwards of two hundred miles .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 84]: Jack took possession of the other berth in the cabin , and his Majesty 's representative was obliged to lie down in his petticoats upon a topsail which lay between decks , with a bullock on each side of him , who every now and then made a dart at him with their horns , as if they knew that it was to him that they were indebted for their embarkation and being destined to drive the scurvy out of the Toulon fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 31]: We can not enter into the details of the passage , which , as the wind was fair , was accomplished in ten days without the loss of a bullock .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 25]: During this time Mr Hicks condescended to eat without speaking , imagining that the hour of retribution would come when they joined the Admiral .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 21]: Gascoigne gradually recovered himself , but did not speak to our hero , who continued to laugh and drink porter .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 38]: On the eleventh morning they were in the midst of the Toulon fleet , and Mr Hicks smiled exultingly as he passed our hero in his petticoats , and wondered that Jack showed no signs of trepidation .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 31]: The fleet hove-to , Jack ran under the Admiral 's stern , lowered down his boat , and went on board , showed his credentials , and reported his bullocks .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 35]: The general signal was made , there was a fair division of the spoil , and then the Admiral asked our hero whether the master of the transport had any other stock on board .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 50]: Jack replied that he had not ; but that , having been told by the Governor of Malta that they might be acceptable , he had bought a few sheep and some dozen of fowls , which were much at his service , if he would accept of them .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 35]: The Admiral was much obliged to the Governor , and also to Jack , for thinking of him , but would not , of course , accept of the stock without paying for them .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 41]: He requested him to send all of them on board that he could spare , and then asked Jack to dine with him , for Jack had put on his best attire , and looked very much of a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 31]: `` Mr Easy , '' said the flag-captain , who had been looking at the transport with his glass , `` is that the master 's wife on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 16]: `` No , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` it 's the vice-consul . ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 6]: `` What , in petticoats !
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 4]: the vice-consul ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 8]: `` Yes , the vice-consul of Tetuan .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 42]: He came on board in that dress when the brig was under way , and I considered it my duty not to delay , being aware how very important it was that the fleet should be provided with fresh beef . ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 10]: `` What is all this , Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 12]: said the Admiral ; `` there has been some trick here .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 11]: You will oblige me by coming into the cabin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 23]: Easy followed the Admiral and flag-captain into the cabin , and then boldly told the whole story how he tricked them all .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 26]: It was impossible for either of them to help laughing , and when they began to laugh , it was almost as impossible to stop .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 70]: `` Mr Easy , '' said the Admiral at last , `` I do not altogether blame you ; it appears to me the captain of the transport would have delayed sailing because he was in love -- and that Mr Gascoigne would have stayed behind because he was infatuated , independent of the ill-will against the English which would have been excited by the abduction of the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 19]: But I think you might have contrived to manage all that without putting the vice-consul in petticoats . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 19]: `` I acted to the best of my judgment , sir , '' replied Jack , very humbly .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 8]: `` And altogether you have done well .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 11]: Captain Malcolm , send a boat for the vice-consul . ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 54]: Mr Hicks was too impatient to tell his wrongs to care for his being in his sister 's clothes : he came on board , and although the tittering was great , he imagined that it would soon be all in his favour , when it was known that he was a diplomatic .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 72]: He told his story , and waited for the decision of the Admiral , which was to crush our hero , who stood with the midshipmen on the lee side of the deck ; but the Admiral replied , `` Mr Hicks , in the first place , this appears to me to be a family affair concerning the marriage of your sister , with which I have nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 14]: You went on board of your own free will in woman 's clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 12]: Mr Easy 's orders were positive , and he obeyed them .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 14]: It was his duty to sail as soon as the transport was ready .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 39]: You may forward your complaint if you please , but , as a friend , I tell you that it will probably occasion your dismissal ; for these kind of pranks are not understood at the foreign office .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 22]: You may return to the transport , which , after she has touched at Mahon , will proceed again to Tetuan .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 8]: The boat is alongside , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 38]: Mr Hicks , astonished at the want of respect paid to a vice-consul , shoved his petticoats between his legs , and went down the side amidst the laughter of the whole of the ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 12]: Our hero dined with the Admiral , and was well received .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 54]: He got his orders to sail that night for Minorca , and as soon as dinner was over he returned on board , where he found Captain Hogg very busy selling his porter -- Gascoigne walking the deck in a brown study -- and Mr Hicks solus abaft , sulking in his petticoats .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 36]: As soon as they were clear of the boats , the Mary Ann hoisted her ensign and made sail , and as all the porter was not yet sold , Jack ordered up a bottle .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 39]: Jack was much pleased with the result of his explanation with the Admiral , and he felt that , for once , he had not only got into no scrape himself , but that he had prevented others .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 77]: Gascoigne walked the deck gloomily ; the fact was , that he was very unhappy : he had had time to reflect , and now that the first violence had subsided , he felt that our hero had done him a real service , and had prevented him from committing an act of egregious folly ; and yet he had summoned this friend to meet him in the field -- and such had been his gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 145]: He would have given the world to recall what had passed , and to make friends , but he felt ashamed , as most people do , to acknowledge his error ; he had , however , almost made up his mind to it , and was walking up and down thinking in what manner he might contrive it , when Jack , who was sitting , as usual , in a chair by the capstern with his porter by him , said to himself , `` Now I 'll lay my life that Ned wants to make friends , and is ashamed to speak first ; I may be mistaken , and he may fly off at a tangent ; but even if I am , at all events it will not be I who am wrong -- I 'll try him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 36]: Jack waited till Gascoigne passed him again , and then said , looking kindly and knowingly in his face , -- `` I say , Ned , will you have a glass of porter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 30]: Gascoigne smiled , and Jack held out his hand ; the reconciliation was effected in a moment , and the subject of quarrel was not canvassed by either party .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 30]: `` We shall be at Minorca in a day or two , '' observed Jack , after a while ; `` now I shall be glad to get there .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 45]: Do you know , Ned , that I feel very much satisfied with myself ; I have got into no scrape this time , and I shall , notwithstanding , have a good story to tell the Governor when I go to Malta . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 10]: `` Partly at my expense , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 19]: `` Why , you will figure a little in it , but others will figure much more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 40]: `` I wonder what has become of that poor girl , '' observed Gascoigne , who could not refrain from mentioning her ; `` what hurts me most is , that she must think me such a brute . ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 16]: `` No doubt of that , Ned , -- take another glass of porter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 10]: `` Her father gave me this large diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 16]: `` The old goat -- sell it , and drink his health with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 14]: `` No , I 'll keep it in memory of his daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 14]: Here Gascoigne fell into a melancholy reverie , and Jack thought of Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 22]: In two days they arrived at Mahon , and found the Aurora already there , in the command of Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 27]: Mr Hicks had persuaded Captain Hogg to furnish him with clothes , Jack having taken off the injunction as soon as he had quitted the Admiral .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 49]: Mr Hicks was aware , that if the Admiral would not listen to his complaint , it was no use speaking to a captain : so he remained on board a pensioner upon Captain Hogg , and after our midshipmen quitted the transport they became very good friends .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 14]: Mr Hicks consented to the match , and Captain Hogg was made happy .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 65]: As for poor Azar , she had wandered about until she was tired , in Miss Hicks 's dress , and at last returned broken hearted to her father 's , and was admitted by Abdel Faza himself ; he imagined it was Miss Hicks , and was in transports -- he discovered it was his daughter , and he was in a fury .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 12]: The next day she went to the zenana of Osman Ali .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 24]: When Jack reported himself he did not tell the history of the elopements , that he might not hurt the feelings of Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 36]: Captain Wilson was satisfied with the manner in which he had executed his orders , and asked him , `` whether he preferred staying in the Harpy , or following him into the Aurora . ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 3]: Jack hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 22]: `` Speak frankly , Mr Easy ; if you prefer Captain Sawbridge to me , I shall not be affronted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 33]: `` No , sir , '' replied Easy , `` I do not prefer Captain Sawbridge to you ; you have both been equally kind to me , but I prefer you .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 25]: But the fact is , sir , that I do not much like to part with Gascoigne or -- '' `` Or who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 6]: said the captain , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 32]: `` With Mesty , sir ; you may think me very foolish , but I should not be alive at this moment , if it had not been for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 18]: `` I do not consider gratitude to be foolish , Mr Easy , '' replied Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 69]: `` Mr Gascoigne I intend to take with me , if he chooses to come , as I have a great respect for his father , and no fault to find with him , that is , generally speaking ; but as for Mesty -- why he is a good man , and as you have behaved yourself very well , perhaps I may think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 41]: The next day Mesty was included among the boat 's crew taken with him by Captain Wilson , according to the regulations of the service , and appointed to the same situation under the master at arms of the Aurora .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 11]: Gascoigne and our hero were also discharged into the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 40]: As our hero never has shown any remarkable predilection for duty , the reader will not be surprised at his requesting from Captain Wilson a few days on shore , previous to his going on board of the Aurora .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 25]: Captain Wilson allowed the same licence to Gascoigne , as they had both been cooped up for some time on board of a transport .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 38]: Our hero took up his quarters at the only respectable hotel in the town , and whenever he could meet an officer of the Aurora , he very politely begged the pleasure of his company to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 21]: Jack 's reputation had gone before him , and the midshipmen drank his wine and swore he was a trump .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 38]: Not that Jack was to be deceived , but , upon the principles of equality , he argued that it was the duty of those who could afford dinners to give them to those who could not .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 43]: This was a sad error on Jack 's part ; but he had not yet learnt the value of money ; he was such a fool as to think that the only real use of it was to make other people happy .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 24]: It must , however , be offered in his extenuation that he was a midshipman and a philosopher , and not yet eighteen .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 61]: At last Jack had remained so long on shore , keeping open house , and the first lieutenant of the Aurora found the officers so much more anxious for leave , now that they were at little or no expense , that he sent him a very polite message , requesting the pleasure of his company on board that evening .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 51]: Jack returned an equally polite answer , informing the first lieutenant that not being aware that he wished to see him , he had promised to accompany some friends to a masquerade that night , but that he would not fail to pay his respects to him the next day .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 49]: The first lieutenant admitted the excuse , and our hero , after having entertained half-a-dozen of the Auroras , for the Harpy had sailed two days before , dressed himself for the masquerade , which was held in a church about two miles and a half from Mahon .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 30]: Jack had selected the costume of the devil , as being the most appropriate , and mounting a jackass , he rode down in his dress to the masquerade .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 126]: But , as Jack was just going in , he perceived a yellow carriage , with two footmen in gaudy liveries , draw up , and with his usual politeness , when the footmen opened the door , offered his arm to hand out a fat old dowager covered with diamonds ; the lady looked up , and perceiving Jack covered with hair , with his trident and his horns , and long tail , gave a loud scream , and would have fallen had it not been for Captain Wilson , who , in his full uniform , was coming in , and caught her in his arms : while the old lady thanked him , and Captain Wilson bowed , Jack hastily retreated .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 61]: `` I shall make no conquests to-night , '' thought he ; so he entered the church , and joined the crowd ; but it was so dense that it was hardly possible to move , and our hero soon got tired of flourishing his trident , and sticking it into people , who wondered what the devil he meant .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 38]: `` This is stupid work , '' thought Jack , `` I may have more fun outside '' : so Jack put on his cloak , left the masquerade , and went out in search of adventures .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 34]: He walked into the open country , about half a mile , until he came to a splendid house , standing in a garden of orange trees , which he determined to reconnoitre .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 32]: He observed that a window was open and lights were in the room ; and he climbed up to the window , and just opened the white curtain and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 53]: On a bed lay an elderly person , evidently dying , and by the side of the bed were three priests , one of whom held the crucifix in his hand , another the censer , and a third was sitting at a table with a paper , pen , and ink .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 43]: As Jack understood Spanish , he listened , and heard one of the priests say : `` Your sins have been enormous , my son , and I can not give you extreme unction or absolution unless you make some amends . ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 24]: `` I have , '' answered the moribund , `` left money for ten thousand masses to be said for my soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 17]: `` Five hundred thousand masses are not sufficient : how have you gained your enormous wealth ?
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 8]: by usury and robbing the poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 21]: `` I have left a thousand dollars to be distributed among the poor on the day of my funeral . ''
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 18]: `` One thousand dollars is nothing -- you must leave all your property to holy church . ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 6]: `` And my children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 7]: replied the dying man , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 10]: `` What are your children compared to your salvation ?
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 33]: reply not : either consent , or not only do I refuse you the consolation of the dying , but I excommunicate -- '' `` Mercy , holy father , mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 10]: said the old man , in a dying voice .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 14]: `` There is no mercy , you are damned for ever and ever .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 2]: Amen .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 19]: Now hear : excommunicabo te -- '' `` Stop -- stop -- have you the paper ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 24]: `` Tis here , all ready , by which you revoke all former wills , and endow the holy church with your property .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 23]: We will read it , for God forbid that it should be said that the holy church received an involuntary gift . ''
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 26]: `` I will sign it , '' replied the dying man , `` but my sight fails me ; be quick , absolve me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 17]: And the paper was signed , with difficulty , as the priests supported the dying man .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 8]: `` And now -- absolve me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 18]: `` I do absolve thee , '' replied the priest , who then went through the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 43]: `` Now this is a confounded rascally business , '' said Jack to himself ; who then dropped his cloak , jumped upon the window-sill , opened wide the window-curtains with both hands , and uttered a yelling kind of `` ha !
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 28]: The priests turned round , saw the demon as they imagined dropped the paper on the table , and threw themselves with their faces on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 8]: `` Exorciso te , '' stammered one .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 22]: repeated Jack , entering the room , and taking up the paper which he burnt by the flame of the candle .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 21]: Our hero looked at the old man on the bed ; his jaw had fallen , his eyes were turned .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 4]: He was dead .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 8]: Jack then gave one more `` ha !
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 37]: to keep the priests in their places , blew out the candles , made a spring out of the window , caught up his cloak , and disappeared as fast as his legs could carry him .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 24]: Jack ran until he was out of breath , and then he stopped , and sat down by the side of the road .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 35]: It was broad moonlight , and Jack knew not where he was : `` but Minorca has not many high roads , '' thought Jack , `` and I shall find my way home .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 15]: Now , let me see , -- I have done some good this evening .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 10]: I have prevented those rogues from disinheriting a family .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 15]: I wonder who they are ; they ought to be infinitely obliged to me .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 13]: But if the priests find me out , what shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 16]: I never dare come on shore again -- they 'd have me in the Inquisition .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 28]: I wonder where I am , '' said Jack ; `` I will get on that hill , and see if I can take a departure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 24]: The hill was formed by the road being cut perpendicularly almost through it , and was perhaps some twelve or fourteen feet high .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 9]: Jack ascended it , and looked about him .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 44]: `` There is the sea , at all events , with the full moon silvering the waves , '' said Jack , turning from the road , `` and here is the road ; then that must be the way to Port Mahon .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 5]: But what comes here ?
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 6]: -- it 's a carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 22]: Why , it 's the yellow carriage of that old lady with her diamonds , and her two splashy footmen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 54]: Jack was watching it as it passed the road under him , when of a sudden , he perceived about a dozen men rush out , and seize the horses ' heads , -- a discharge of fire-arms , the coachman dropped off the box , and the two footmen dropped from behind .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 19]: The robbers then opened the door , and were hauling out the fat old lady covered with diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 37]: Jack thought a second -- it occurred to him , that although he could not cope with so many , he might frighten them , as he had frightened one set of robbers already that night .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 82]: The old lady had just been tumbled out of the carriage-door , like a large bundle of clothes tied up for the wash , when Jack , throwing off his cloak , and advancing to the edge of the precipice , with the full moon behind him throwing out his figure in strong relief , raised his trident , and just as they were raising their knives , yelled a most unearthly `` ha , ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 42]: The robbers looked up , and forgetting the masquerade , for there is a double tremor in guilt , screamed with fear ; most of them ran away , and dropped after a hundred yards ; others remained paralysed and insensible .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 44]: Jack descended the hill , went to the assistance of the old lady , who had swooned , and had to put her into the carriage ; but although our hero was very strong , this was a work of no small difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 46]: After one or two attempts , he lowered down the steps and contrived to bump her on the first , from the first he purchased her on the second , and from the second he at last seated her at the door of the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 8]: Jack had no time to be over-polite .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 49]: He then threw her back into the bottom of the carriage , her heels went up to the top , Jack shoved in her petticoats as fast as he could , for decency , and then shutting the door seized the reins , and jumped upon the box .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 65]: `` I do n't know the way , '' thought Jack , `` but we must needs go when the devil drives '' ; so sticking his trident into the horses , they set off at a rattling pace , passing over the bodies of the two robbers , who had held the reins , and who both lay before him in a swoon .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 60]: As soon as he had brought the horses into a trot , he slackened the reins , for , as Jack wisely argued , they will be certain to go home if I let them have their own way The horses , before they arrived at the town , turned off , and stopped at a large country house .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 33]: That he might not frighten the people , Jack had put on his cloak , and taken off his mask and head-piece , which he had laid beside him on the box .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 24]: At the sound of the carriage-wheels the servants came out , when Jack , in few words , told them what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 54]: Some of the servants ran in , and a young lady made her appearance , while the others were helping the old lady out of the carriage , who had recovered her senses , but had been so much frightened that she had remained in the posture in which Jack had put her .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 17]: As soon as she was out , Jack descended from the coach-box and entered the house .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 63]: He stated to the young lady what had taken place , and how opportunely he had frightened away the robbers , just as they were about to murder her relation ; and also suggested the propriety of sending after the servants who had fallen in the attack ; which was immediately done by a strong and well-armed party collected for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 32]: Jack , having made his speech , made a very polite bow and took his leave , stating that he was an English officer belonging to a frigate in the harbour .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 22]: He knew his way back , and in half an hour was again at the inn , and found his comrades .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 33]: Jack thought it advisable to keep his own secret , and therefore merely said , that he had taken a long walk in the country ; and soon afterwards went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 25]: The next morning our hero , who was always a man of his word , packed up his portmanteau , and paid his bill .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 68]: He had just completed this heavy operation , when somebody wanted to speak to him , and a sort of half-clerical , half-legal sort of looking gentleman was introduced , who , with a starched face and prim air , said that he came to request in writing the name of the officer who was dressed as a devil , in the masquerade of the night before .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 15]: Jack looked at his interrogator , and thought of the priests and the Inquisition .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 33]: `` No , no , '' thought he , `` that wo n't do ; a name I must give , but it shall be one that you dare not meddle with .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 30]: A midshipman you might get hold of , but it 's more than the whole island dare to touch a post-captain of one of his Majesty 's frigates . ''
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 18]: So Jack took the paper and wrote Captain Henry Wilson , of his Majesty 's ship Aurora .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 17]: The prim man made a prim bow , folded up the paper and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 17]: Jack threw the waiter half a doubloon , lighted his cigar , and went on board .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 24]: CHAPTER XXV In which the old proverb is illustrated , `` That you must not count your chickens before they are hatched . ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 63]: The first lieutenant of the Aurora was a very good officer in many respects , but , as a midshipman , he had contracted the habit of putting his hands in his pockets , and could never keep them out , even when the ship was in a gale of wind ; and hands are of some use in a heavy lurch .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 122]: He had more than once received serious injury from falling on these occasions , but habit was too powerful ; and , although he had once broken his leg by falling down the hatchway , and had moreover a large scar on his forehead , received from being thrown to leeward against one of the guns , he still continued the practice ; indeed , it was said that once when it was necessary for him to go aloft , he had actually taken the two first rounds of the Jacob 's ladder without withdrawing them , until , losing his balance , he discovered that it was not quite so easy to go aloft with his hands in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 19]: In fact , there was no getting up his hands , even when all hands were turned up .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 53]: He had another peculiarity , which was , that he had taken a peculiar fancy to a quack medicine , called Enouy 's Universal Medicine for all Mankind ; and Mr Pottyfar was convinced in his own mind that the label was no libel , except from the greatness of its truth .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 48]: In his opinion , it cured everything , and he spent one of his quarterly bills every year in bottles of this stuff ; which he not only took himself every time he was unwell , but occasionally when quite well , to prevent his falling sick .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 32]: He recommended it to everybody in the ship , and nothing pleased him so much as to give a dose of it to everyone who could be persuaded to take it .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 39]: The officers laughed at him , but it was generally behind his back , for he became very angry if contradicted upon this one point , upon which he certainly might be considered to be a little cracked .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 49]: He was indefatigable in making proselytes to his creed , and expatiated upon the virtues of the medicine , for an hour running , proving the truth of his assertions by a pamphlet , which , with his hands , he always carried in his trousers ' pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 78]: Jack reported himself when he came on board , and Mr Pottyfar , who was on the quarter-deck at the time , expressed a hope that Mr Easy would take his share of the duty , now that he had had such a spell on shore ; to which Jack very graciously acceded , and then went down below , where he found Gascoigne and his new messmates , with most of whom he was already acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 19]: `` Well , Easy , '' said Gascoigne , `` have you had enough of the shore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 39]: `` Quite , '' replied Jack , recollecting that , after the events of the night before , he was just as well on board ; `` I do n't intend to ask for any more leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 36]: `` Perhaps it 's quite as well , for Mr Pottyfar is not very liberal on that score , I can tell you ; there is but one way of getting leave from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 10]: replied Jack ; `` and what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 33]: `` You must pretend that you are not well , take some of his quack medicine , and then he will allow you a run on shore to work it off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 7]: that 's it , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 25]: well then , as soon as we anchor in Valette , I 'll go through a regular course , but not till then . ''
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 26]: `` It ought to suit you , Jack ; it 's an equality medicine ; cures one disorder just as well as the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 10]: `` Or kills -- which levels all the patients .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 18]: You 're right , Gascoigne , I must patronise that stuff -- for more reasons than one .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 10]: Who was that person on deck in mufti ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 26]: `` The mufti , Jack ; in other words , the chaplain of the ship , but he 's a prime sailor , nevertheless . ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 6]: `` How 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 37]: `` Why , he was brought up on the quarter-deck , served his time , was acting lieutenant for two years , and then , somehow or another , he bore up for the church . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 9]: `` Indeed -- what were his reasons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 16]: `` No one knows -- but they say he has been unhappy ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 5]: `` Why so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 16]: `` Because he did a very foolish thing , which can not now be remedied .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 61]: He supposed at the time that he would make a good parson , and now that he has long got over his fit , he finds himself wholly unfit for it -- he is still the officer in heart , and is always struggling with his natural bent , which is very contrary to what a parson should feel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 32]: `` Why do n't they allow parsons to be broke by a court-martial , and turned out of the service , or to resign their commissions , like other people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 24]: `` It wo n't do , Jack -- they serve heaven -- there 's a difference between that and serving his Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 10]: `` Well , I do n't understand these things .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 6]: When do we sail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 7]: `` The day after to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 9]: `` To join the fleet of Toulon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 17]: `` Yes : but I suppose we shall be driven on the Spanish coast going there .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 10]: I never knew a man-of-war that was not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 16]: `` No ; wind always blows from the south , going up the Mediterranean . ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 23]: `` Perhaps you 'll take another prize , Jack -- mind you do n't go away without the articles of war . ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 15]: `` I wo n't go away without Mesty , if I can help it .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 17]: O dear , how abominable a midshipman 's berth is after a long run on shore !
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 20]: I positively must go on deck and look at the shore , if I can do nothing else . ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 14]: `` Why , ten minutes ago you had had enough of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 14]: `` Yes , but ten minutes here has made me feel quite sick .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 12]: I shall go to the first lieutenant for a dose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 17]: `` I say , Easy , we must both be physicked on the same day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 14]: `` To be sure ; but stop till we get to Malta . ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 68]: Jack went on deck , made acquaintance with the chaplain and some of the officers whom he had not known , then climbed up into the main-top , where he took a seat on the armolest , and , as he looked at the shore , thought over the events that had passed , until Agnes came to his memory , and he thought only of her .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 46]: When a mid is in love , he always goes aloft to think of the object of his affection ; why , I do n't know , except that his reverie is not so likely to be disturbed by an order from a superior officer .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 45]: The Aurora sailed on the second day , and , with a fine breeze , stood across , making as much northing as easting ; the consequence was , that one fine morning they saw the Spanish coast before they saw the Toulon fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 55]: Mr Pottyfar took his hands out of his pockets , because he could not examine the coast through a telescope without so doing ; but this , it is said , was the first time that he had done so on the quarter-deck from the day that the ship had sailed from Port Mahon .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 41]: Captain Wilson was also occupied with his telescope , so were many of the officers and midshipmen , and the men at the mastheads used their eyes , but there was nothing but a few small fishing-boats to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 19]: So they all went down to breakfast , as the ship was hove-to close in with the land .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 24]: `` What will Easy bet , '' said one of the midshipmen , `` that we do n't see a prize to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 35]: `` I will not bet that we do not see a vessel -- but I 'll bet you what you please , that we do not take one before twelve o'clock at night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 27]: `` No , no , that wo n't do -- just let the teapot travel over this way , for it 's my forenoon watch . ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 35]: `` It 's a fine morning , '' observed one of the mates , of the name of Martin ; `` but I 've a notion it wo n't be a fine evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 3]: inquired another .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 18]: `` I 've now been eight years in the Mediterranean , and know something about the weather .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 13]: There 's a watery sky , and the wind is very steady .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 16]: If we are not under double-reefed topsails to-night , say I 'm no conjurer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 21]: `` That you will be , all the same , if we are under bare poles , '' said another .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 21]: `` You 're devilish free with your tongue , my youngster -- Easy , pull his ears for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 16]: `` Pull them easy , Jack , then , '' said the boy , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 7]: `` All hands make sail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 6]: now resounded at the hatchways .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 69]: `` There they are , depend upon it , '' cried Gascoigne , catching up his hat and bolting out of the berth , followed by all the others except Martin , who had just been relieved , and thought that his presence in the waist might be dispensed with for the short time , at least , which it took him to swallow a cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 35]: It was very true ; a galliot and four lateen vessels had just made their appearance round the easternmost point , and as soon as they observed the frigate , had hauled their wind .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 22]: In a minute the Aurora was under a press of canvas , and the telescopes were all directed to the vessels .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 26]: `` All deeply laden , sir , '' observed Mr Hawkins , the chaplain ; `` how the topsail of the galliot is scored ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 18]: `` They have a fresh breeze just now , '' observed Captain Wilson to the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir , and it 's coming down fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 10]: `` Hands by the royal halyards , there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 11]: The Aurora careened with the canvas to the rapidly-increasing breeze .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 7]: `` Top-gallant sheet and halyards . ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 13]: `` Luff you may , quarter-master ; luff , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 18]: A small pull of that weather maintop-gallant brace -- that will do , '' said the master .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 24]: `` Top-men aloft there ; -- stand by to clew up the royals and , Captain Wilson , shall we take them in ?
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 31]: -- I 'm afraid of that pole -- it bends now like a coach-whip , '' said Mr Pottyfar , looking up aloft , with his hands in both pockets .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 8]: `` In royals -- lower away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 17]: `` They are going about , sir , '' said the second lieutenant , Mr Haswell .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 15]: `` Look out , '' observed the chaplain , `` it 's coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 12]: Again the breeze increased , and the frigate was borne down .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 11]: `` Hands reef topsails in stays , Mr Pottyfar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 12]: `` Aye , aye , sir -- ` bout ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 14]: The helm was put down and the topsails lowered and reefed in stays .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 16]: `` Very well , my lads , very well indeed , '' said Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 41]: Again the topsails were hoisted and top-gallant sheets home It was a strong breeze , although the water was smooth , and the Aurora dashed through at the rate of eight miles an hour , with her weather leeches lifting .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 9]: `` Did n't I tell you so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 19]: said Martin to his messmates on the gangway `` but there 's more yet , my boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 35]: `` We must take the top-gallant sails off her , '' said Captain Wilson , looking aloft -- for the frigate now careened to her bearings , and the wind was increasing and squally .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 27]: `` Try them a little longer '' ; but another squall came suddenly -- the halyards were lowered , and the sails clewed up and furled .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 26]: In the meantime the frigate had rapidly gained upon the vessels , which still carried on every stitch of canvas , making short tacks in-shore .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 22]: The Aurora was again put about with her head towards them , and they were not two points on her weather-bow .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 31]: The sky , which had been clear in the morning , was now overcast , the sun was obscured with opaque white clouds , and the sea was rising fast .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 20]: Another ten minutes , and then they were under double-reefed topsails and the squalls were accompanied with heavy rain .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 21]: The frigate now dashed through the waves , foaming in her course , and straining under the press of sail .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 16]: The horizon was so thick that the vessels ahead were no longer to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 14]: `` We shall have it , I expect , '' said Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 8]: `` Did n't I say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 5]: observed Martin to Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 13]: `` We take no prizes this day , depend upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 27]: `` We must have another hand to the wheel , sir , if you please , '' said the quarter-master , who was assisting the helmsman .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 15]: Mr Pottyfar , with his hands concealed as usual , stood by the capstern .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 16]: `` I fear , sir , we can not carry the mainsail much longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 15]: `` No , '' observed the chaplain , `` I was thinking so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 31]: `` Captain Wilson , if you please , we are very close in , '' said the master ; `` do n't you think we had better go about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 6]: `` Yes , Mr Jones .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 13]: Hands about ship -- and , yes , by heavens we must !
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 5]: -- up mainsail . ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 15]: The mainsail was taken off , and the frigate appeared to be immediately relieved .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 9]: She no longer jerked and plunged as before .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 35]: `` We 're very near the land , Captain Wilson ; thick as it is , I think I can make out the loom of it -- shall we wear round , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 4]: continued the master .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 13]: `` Yes , hands wear ship -- put the helm up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 45]: It was but just in time , for , as the frigate flew round , describing a circle , as she payed off before the wind , they could perceive the breakers lashing the precipitous coast , not two cables ' length from them .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 29]: `` I had no idea we were so near , '' observed the captain , compressing his lips -- `` can they see anything of those vessels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 29]: `` I have not seen them this quarter of an hour , sir , '' replied the signal-man , protecting his glass from the rain under his jacket .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 10]: `` How 's her head now , quarter-master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 7]: `` South south-east , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 34]: The sky now assumed a different appearance -- the white clouds had been exchanged for others dark and murky , the wind roared at intervals , and the rain came down in torrents .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 12]: Captain Wilson went down into the cabin to examine the barometer .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 15]: `` The barometer has risen , '' said he on his return on deck .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 7]: `` Is the wind steady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 14]: `` No , sir , she 's up and off three points . ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 9]: `` This will end in a south-wester . ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 14]: The wet and heavy sails now flapped from the shifting of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 9]: `` Up with the helm , quarter-master . ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 12]: `` Up it is -- she 's off to south-by-west . ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 29]: The wind lulled , the rain came down in a deluge -- for a minute it was quite calm , and the frigate was on an even keel .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 5]: `` Man the braces .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 13]: We shall be taken aback , directly , depend upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 12]: The braces were hardly stretched along before this was the case .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 41]: The wind flew round to the south-west with a loud roar , and it was fortunate that they were prepared -- the yards were braced round , and the master asked the captain , what course they were to steer .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 19]: `` We must give it up , '' observed Captain Wilson , holding on by the belaying pin .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 12]: `` Shape our course for Cape Sicie , Mr Jones . ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 16]: And the Aurora flew before the gale , under her foresail and topsails close reefed .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 33]: The weather was now so thick that nothing could be observed twenty yards from the vessel ; the thunder pealed , and the lightning darted in every direction over the dark expanse .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 26]: The watch was called as soon as the sails were trimmed , and all who could went below , wet , uncomfortable , and disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 14]: `` What an old Jonah you are , Martin , '' said Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 24]: `` Yes , I am , '' replied he ; `` but we have the worst to come yet , in my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 93]: I recollect , not two hundred miles from where we are now , we had just such a gale in the Favourite , and we as nearly went down , when -- '' At this moment a tremendous noise was heard above , a shock was felt throughout the whole ship , which trembled fore and aft as if it was about to fall into pieces : loud shrieks were followed by plaintive cries , the lower deck was filled with smoke , and the frigate was down on her beam ends .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 38]: Without exchanging a word , the whole of the occupants of the berth flew out , and were up the hatchway , not knowing what to think , but convinced that some dreadful accident had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 45]: On their gaining the deck it was at once explained ; the foremast of the frigate had been struck by lightning , had been riven into several pieces , and had fallen over the larboard bow , carrying with it the main-topmast and jib-boom .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 21]: The jagged stump of the foremast was in flames , and burned brightly , notwithstanding the rain fell in torrents .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 66]: The ship , as soon as the foremast and main topmast had gone overboard , broached-to furiously , throwing the men over the wheel and dashing them senseless against the carronades ; the forecastle , the forepart of the main deck , and even the lower deck , were spread with men , either killed or seriously wounded , or insensible from the electric shock .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 81]: The frigate was on her beam ends , and the sea broke furiously over her ; all was dark as pitch , except the light from the blazing stump of the foremast , appearing like a torch , held up by the wild demons of the storm , or when occasionally the gleaming lightning cast a momentary glare , threatening every moment to repeat its attack upon the vessel , while the deafening thunder burst almost on their devoted heads .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 99]: All was dismay and confusion for a minute or two : at last Captain Wilson , who had himself lost his sight for a short time , called for the carpenter and axes -- they climbed up , that is , two or three of them , and he pointed to the mizzen-mast ; the master was also there , and he cut loose the axes for the seamen to use ; in a few minutes the mizzen-mast fell over the quarter , and the helm being put hard up , the frigate payed off and slowly righted .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 11]: But the horror of the scene was not yet over .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 23]: The boatswain , who had been on the forecastle , had been led below , for his vision was gone for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 31]: The men who lay scattered about had been examined , and they were assisting them down to the care of the surgeon , when the cry of `` Fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 6]: issued from the lower deck .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 22]: The ship had taken fire at the coal-hole and carpenter 's store-room , and the smoke that now ascended was intense .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 35]: `` Call the drummer , '' said Captain Wilson , `` and let him beat to quarters -- all hands to their stations -- let the pumps be rigged and the buckets passed along .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 13]: Mr Martin , see that the wounded men are taken down below .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 5]: Where 's Mr Haswell ?
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 18]: Mr Pottyfar , station the men to pass the water on by hand on the lower deck .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 6]: I will go there myself .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 10]: Mr Jones , take charge of the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 36]: Pottyfar , who actually had taken his hands out of his pockets , hastened down to comply with the captain 's orders on the main deck , as Captain Wilson descended to the deck below .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 18]: `` I say , Jack , this is very different from this morning , '' observed Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 26]: `` Yes , '' replied Jack , `` so it is ; but I say , Gascoigne , what 's the best thing to do ?
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 19]: -- when the chimney 's on fire on shore , they put a wet blanket over it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 26]: `` Yes , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` but when the coal-hole 's on fire on board , they will not find that sufficient . ''
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 56]: `` At all events , wet blankets must be a good firing , Ned , so let us pull out the hammocks ; cut the lanyards and get some out -- we can but offer them , you know , and if they do no good , at least it will show our zeal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 32]: `` Yes , Jack , and I think when they turn in again , those whose blankets you take will agree with you , that zeal makes the service very uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 9]: However , I think you are right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 70]: The two midshipmen collected three or four hands , and in a very short time they had more blankets than they could carry -- there was no trouble in wetting them , for the main deck was afloat -- and followed by the men they had collected , Easy and Gascoigne went down with large bundles in their arms to where Captain Wilson was giving directions to the men .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 15]: `` Excellent , Mr Easy , excellent , Mr Gascoigne '' said Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 36]: `` Come , my lads , throw them over now , and stamp upon them well '' ; the men 's jackets and the captain 's coat had already been sacrificed to the same object .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 42]: Easy called the other midshipmen , and they went up for a further supply ; but there was no occasion , the fire had been smothered : still the danger had been so great that the fore magazine had been floated .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 28]: During all this , which lasted perhaps a quarter of an hour , the frigate had rolled gunwale under , and many were the accidents which occurred .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 57]: At last all danger from fire had ceased , and the men were ordered to return to their quarters , when three officers and forty-seven men were found absent -- seven of them were dead , most of them were already under the care of the surgeon , but some were still lying in the scuppers .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 22]: No one had been more active or more brave during this time of danger , than Mr Hawkins , the chaplain .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 28]: He was everywhere , and when Captain Wilson went down to put out the fire he was there , encouraging the men and exerting himself most gallantly .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 18]: He and Mesty came aft when all was over , one just as black as the other .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 15]: The chaplain sat down and wrung his hands -- `` God forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 9]: said he , `` God forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 7]: `` Why so , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 7]: said Easy , who stood near .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 16]: `` I am sure you need not be ashamed of what you have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 37]: `` No , no , not ashamed of what I 've done ; but , Mr Easy -- I have sworn so , sworn such oaths at the men in haste -- I , the chaplain !
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 4]: God forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 6]: -- I meant nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 43]: It was very true that Mr Hawkins had sworn a great deal during his exertions , but he was at that time the quarter-deck officer and not the chaplain ; the example to the men and his gallantry had been most serviceable .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 49]: `` Indeed , sir , '' said Easy , who saw the chaplain was in great tribulation , and hoped to pacify him , `` I was certainly not there all the time , but I only heard you say , ` God bless you , my men !
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 16]: be smart , ' and so on ; surely , that is not swearing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 14]: `` Was it that I said , Mr Easy , are you sure ?
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 29]: I really had an idea that I had d -- d them all in heaps , as some of them deserved -- no , no , not deserved .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 12]: Did I really bless them -- nothing but bless them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 33]: `` Yes , sir , '' said Mesty , who perceived what Jack wanted : `` it was nothing , I assure you , but ` God bless you , Captain Wilson !
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 9]: -- Bless your heart , my good men !
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 6]: - Bless the king ! '
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 4]: and so on .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 12]: You do nothing but shower down blessing and wet blanket . ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 10]: `` I told you so , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 27]: `` Well , Mr Easy , you 've made me very happy , '' replied the chaplain ; `` I was afraid it was otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 119]: So indeed it was , for the chaplain had sworn like a boatswain ; but as Jack and Mesty had turned all his curses into blessings , the poor man gave himself absolution , and shaking hands with Jack , hoped he would come down into the gun-room and take a glass of grog ; nor did he forget Mesty , who received a good allowance at the gun-room door , to which Jack gladly consented , as the rum in the middy 's berth had all been exhausted after the rainy morning ; but Jack was interrupted in his third glass , by somebody telling him the captain wanted to speak with Mr Hawkins and with him .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 15]: Jack went up , and found the captain on the quarter-deck with the officers .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 43]: `` Mr Easy , '' said Captain Wilson , `` I have sent for you , Mr Hawkins , and Mr Gascoigne , to thank you on the quarter-deck , for your exertions and presence of mind on this trying occasion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 6]: Mr Hawkins made a bow .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 17]: Gascoigne said nothing , but he thought of having extra leave when they arrived at Malta .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 31]: Jack felt inclined to make a speech , and began something about when there was danger that it levelled every one to an equality even on board of a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 44]: `` By no means , Mr Easy , '' replied Captain Wilson ; `` it does the very contrary ; for it proves which is the best man , and those who are the best raise themselves at once above the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 71]: Jack was very much inclined to argue the point , but he took the compliment and held his tongue , which was the wisest thing he could have done ; so he made his bow , and was about to go down into the midshipmen 's berth when the frigate was pooped by a tremendous sea , which washed all those who did not hold on down into the waist .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 111]: Jack was among the number , and naturally catching at the first object which touched him , he caught hold of the chaplain by the leg , who commenced swearing most terribly : but before he could finish the oath , the water which had burst into the cabin through the windows -- for the dead lights , in the confusion , had not yet been shipped -- burst out of the cross bulk-heads , sweeping like a torrent the marine , the cabin-door , and everything else in its force , and floating Jack and the chaplain with several others down the main hatchway on to the lower deck .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 61]: The lower deck being also full of water , men and chests were rolling and tossing about , and Jack was sometimes in company with the chaplain , and at other times separated ; at last they both recovered their legs , and gained the midshipmen 's berth , which , although afloat , was still a haven of security .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 17]: Mr Hawkins spluttered and spit , and so did Jack , until he began to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 22]: `` This is very trying , Mr Easy , '' said the chaplain ; `` very trying indeed to the temper .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 11]: I hope I have not sworn I hope not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 29]: `` Not a word , '' said Jack -- `` I was close to you all the time -- you only said ` God preserve us ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 4]: `` Only that ?
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 15]: I was afraid that I said ` God d -- n it ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 8]: `` Quite a mistake , Mr Hawkins .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 42]: Let 's go into the gun-room , and try to wash this salt water out of our mouths , and then I will tell you all you said , as far as I could hear it , word for word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 58]: So Jack by this means got another glass of grog , which was very acceptable in his wet condition , and made himself very comfortable , while those on deck were putting on the dead lights , and very busy setting the goose-wings of the mainsail , to prevent the frigate from being pooped a second time .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 20]: CHAPTER XXVI In which our hero becomes excessively unwell , and agrees to go through a course of medicine .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 56]: The hammocks were not piped down that night : some were taken indiscriminately for the wounded , but the rest remained in the nettings , for all hands were busy preparing jury masts and jury rigging , and Mr Pottyfar was so well employed that for twelve hours his hands were not in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 31]: It was indeed a dreadful night : the waves were mountains high , and chased the frigate in their fury , cresting , breaking , and roaring at her taffrail .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 27]: But she flew before them with the wings of the wind ; four men at the helm , assisted by others at the relieving tackles below .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 67]: Jack , having been thanked on and washed off the quarter-deck , thought that he had done quite enough : he was as deep as he could swim before he had satisfied all the scruples of the Chaplin and , stowing himself away on one of the lockers of the midshipmen 's berth , was soon fast asleep , notwithstanding that the frigate rolled gunwale under .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 31]: Gascoigne had done much better ; he had taken down a hammock , as he said , for a poor wounded man , hung it up and turned in himself .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 51]: The consequence was , that the next morning the surgeon , who saw him lying in the hammock , had put him down in the report , but as Gascoigne had got up as well as ever , he laughed and scratched his name out of the list of wounded .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 39]: Before morning the ship had been pumped out dry , and all below made as secure and safe as circumstances would permit ; but the gale still continued its violence , and there was anything but comfort onboard .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 14]: `` I say , Martin , you ought to be thrown overboard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 20]: said Gascoigne ; `` all this comes from your croaking -- you 're a Mother Cary 's chicken . ''
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 33]: `` I wish I had been anyone 's chicken , '' replied Martin ; `` but the devil a thing to nestle under have I had since I can well remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 28]: `` What a bore to have no galley-fire lighted , '' said one of the youngsters ; `` no tea , and not allowed any grog . ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 34]: `` The gale will last three days , '' replied Martin , `` and by that time we shall not be far from the Admiral ; it wo n't blow home there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 24]: `` Well , then , we shall be ordered in directly , and I shall go on shore to-morrow , '' replied Easy .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 12]: `` Yes , if you 're ill , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 10]: `` Never fear , I shall be sick enough .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 18]: We shall be there at least six weeks , and then we 'll forget all this . ''
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 25]: `` Yes , '' replied Martin , `` we may forget it , but will the poor fellows whose limbs are shrivelled forget it ?
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 14]: and will poor Miles , the boatswain , who is blind forever ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 28]: `` Very true , Martin ; we are thinking about ourselves , not thankful for our escape , and not feeling for others , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 13]: `` Give us your hand , Ned , '' said Jack Easy .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 25]: `` And , Martin , we ought to thank you for telling us the truth -- we are a selfish set of fellows . ''
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 17]: `` Still we took our share with the others , '' replied one of the midshipman .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 42]: `` That 's more reason for us to be grateful and to pity them , '' replied Jack ; `` suppose you had lost your arm or your eyesight -- we would have pitied you ; so now pity others . ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 14]: `` Well , so I do , now I think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 14]: `` Think oftener , youngster , '' observed Martin , going on deck .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 44]: What a change from the morning of the day before ; but twenty-four hours had passed away , and the sea had been smooth ; the frigate dashed through the blue water , proud in all her canvas , graceful as a swan .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 64]: Since that there had been fire , tempest , lightning , disaster , danger , and death ; her masts were tossed about on the snowy waves , hundreds of miles away from her , and she -- a wreck -- was rolling heavily , groaning and complaining in every timber , as she urged her impetuous race with the furious running sea .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 14]: How wrong are those on shore who assert that sailors are not religious !
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 18]: -- how is it possible , supposing them to be possessed of feeling , to be otherwise ?
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 124]: On shore , where you have nothing but the change of seasons , each in its own peculiar beauty -- nothing but the blessings of the earth , its fruits , its flowers -- nothing but the bounty , the comforts , the luxuries which have been invented , where you can rise in the morning in peace , and lay down your head at night in security -- God may be neglected and forgotten for a long time ; but at sea , when each gale is a warning , each disaster acts as a check , each escape as a homily upon the forbearance of Providence , that man must be indeed brutalised who does not feel that God is there .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 30]: On shore we seldom view Him but in all His beauty and kindness ; but at sea we are as often reminded how terrible He is in His wrath .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 25]: Can it be supposed that the occurrences of the last twenty-four hours were lost upon the minds of any one man in that ship ?
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 22]: In their courage and activity they might appear reckless , but in their hearts they acknowledged and bowed unto their God .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 51]: Before the day was over , a jury-foremast had been got up , and sail having been put upon it , the ship was steered with greater ease and safety -- the main brace had been spliced to cheer up the exhausted crew , and the hammocks were piped down .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 81]: As Gascoigne had observed , some of the men were not very much pleased to find that they were minus their blankets , but Captain Wilson ordered their losses to be supplied by the purser and expended by the master ; this quite altered the case , as they obtained new blankets in most cases for old ones , but still it was impossible to light the galley fire , and the men sat on their chests and nibbled biscuit .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 29]: By twelve o'clock that night the gale broke , and more sail was necessarily put on the scudding vessels for the sea still ran fast and mountains high .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 47]: At daylight the sun burst out and shone brightly on them , the sea went gradually down , the fire was lighted , and Mr Pottyfar , whose hands were again in his pockets , at twelve o'clock gave the welcome order to pipe to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 33]: As soon as the men had eaten their dinner , the frigate was once more brought to the wind , her jury-mast forward improved upon , and more sail made upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 42]: The next morning there was nothing of the gale left except the dire effects which it had produced , the black and riven stump of the foremast still holding up a terrific warning of the power and fury of the elements .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 12]: Three days more , and the Aurora joined the Toulon fleet .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 44]: When she was first seen it was imagined by those on board of the other ships that she had been in action , but they soon learnt that the conflict had been against more direful weapons than any yet invented by mortal hands .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 20]: Captain Wilson waited upon the Admiral , and of course received immediate orders to repair to port and refit .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 25]: In a few hours the Aurora had shaped her course for Malta , and by sunset the Toulon fleet were no longer in sight .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 35]: `` By de holy poker , Massa Easy , but that terrible sort of gale the other day anyhow -- I tink one time , we all go to Davy Joney 's lacker . ''
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 16]: `` Very true , Mesty ; I hope never to meet with such another . ''
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 12]: `` Den , Massa Easy , why you go to sea ?
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 30]: when man ab no money , noting to eat , den he go to sea , but everybody say you ab plenty money why you come to sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 31]: `` I 'm sure I do n't know , '' replied Jack , thoughtfully ; `` I came to sea on account of equality and the rights of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 13]: `` Eh , Massa Easy , you come to wrong place anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 21]: Now I tink a good deal lately , and by all de power , I tink equality all stuff . ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 8]: `` All stuff , Mesty , why ?
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 7]: You used to think otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 17]: `` Yes , Massa Easy , but den I boil de kettle for all young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 17]: Now dat I ship 's corporal and hab cane , I tink so no longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 11]: Jack made no reply , but he thought the more .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 47]: The reader must have perceived that Jack 's notions of equality were rapidly disappearing ; he defended them more from habit , and perhaps a wilfulness which would not allow him to acknowledge himself wrong ; -- to which may be added his love of argument .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 53]: Already he had accustomed himself to obedience of his superiors , and , notwithstanding his arguments , he would admit of no resistance from those below him ; not that it was hardly ever attempted , for Jack was anything but a tyrant and was much beloved by all in the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 28]: Every day brought its lesson , and Captain Wilson was now satisfied that Jack had been almost cured of the effects of his father 's ridiculous philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 15]: After a few minutes , Mesty tapped his cane on the funnel and recommenced .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 12]: `` Then why you stay at sea , Massa Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 15]: `` I do n't know , Mesty , I do n't dislike it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 33]: `` But , Massa Easy , why you stay in midshipman berth , eat hard biscuit , salt pig , salt horse , when you can go shore and live like gentleman ?
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 4]: Dat very foolish !
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 7]: Why not be your own master ?
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 4]: By all power !
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 10]: suppose I had money , catch me board ship .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 23]: Little sea very good , Massa Easy , open one 's eyes ; but tink of the lightning t ` other night .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 11]: Poor massa boatswain he shut um eyes for ebber ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 7]: `` Very true , Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 22]: `` Me hope you fink of this , sar , and when you go on shore you take Mesty wid you .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 19]: He sarve you well , Massa Easy , long as he live , by de holy St Patrick .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 17]: And den , Massa Easy , you marry wife -- hab pickaninny -- lib like gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 9]: You tink of this , Massa Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 21]: The mention of the word marriage turned the thoughts of our hero to his Agnes and he made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 10]: Mesty walked away leaving our hero in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 37]: This conversation had more effect upon Jack than would have been imagined , and he very often found he was putting to himself the question of Mesty -- `` Why do you stay at sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 38]: He had not entered the service with any particular view , except to find equality , and he could not but acknowledge to himself that , as Mesty observed , he had come to the wrong place .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 27]: He had never even thought of staying to serve his time , nor had he looked forward to promotion , and one day commanding a ship .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 25]: He had only cared for the present , without indulging in a future anticipation of any reward , except in a union with Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 49]: Mesty 's observations occasioned Jack to reflect upon the future for the first time in his life ; and he was always perplexed when he put the question of Mesty , and tried to answer to himself as to what were his intentions in remaining in the service .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 32]: Nevertheless Jack did his duty very much to the satisfaction of Mr Pottyfar ; and after a tedious passage , from baffling and light winds , the Aurora arrived at Malta .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 40]: Our hero had had some conversation with his friend Gascoigne , in which he canvassed his future plans ; all of which , however , ended in one settled point , which was that he was to marry Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 22]: As for the rest , Gascoigne was of opinion that Jack ought to follow up the service and become a captain .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 53]: But there was plenty of time to think about that , as he observed ; now all they had to consider was how to get on shore , for the refitting of the ship was an excuse for detaining them on board , which they knew Mr Pottyfar would avail himself of .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 23]: Jack dined in the gun-room on the day of their arrival , and he resolved that he would ask that very evening .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 11]: Captain Wilson was already on shore at the Governor 's .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 49]: Now , there had been a little difference of opinion between Mr Pottyfar and Mr Hawkins , the chaplain , on a point of seamanship , and most of the officers sided with the chaplain , who , as we have before observed , was a first-rate seaman .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 72]: It had ended in high words , for Mr Hawkins had forgotten himself so far as to tell the first lieutenant that he had a great deal to learn , not having even got over the midshipman 's trick of keeping his hands in his pockets ; and Mr Pottyfar had replied that it was very well for him as chaplain to insult others , knowing that his cassock protected him .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 32]: This was a bitter reply to Mr Hawkins , who at the very time that the insinuation made his blood boil , was also reminded that his profession forbade a retort .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 30]: He rushed into his cabin , poor fellow , having no other method left , vented his indignation in tears , and then consoled himself by degrees with prayer .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 25]: In the meantime Mr Pottyfar had gone on deck , wroth with Hawkins and with his messmates , as well as displeased with himself .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 28]: He was , indeed , in a humour to be pleased with nobody , and in a most unfortunate humour to be asked leave by a midshipman .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 23]: Nevertheless , Jack politely took off his hat , and requested leave to go on shore and see his friend the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 48]: Upon which Mr Pottyfar turned round to him , with his feet spread wide open , and , thrusting his hands to the very bottom of his pockets , as if in determination , said : `` Mr Easy , you know the state of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 26]: We have everything to do -- new masts , new rigging , everything almost to refit -- and yet you ask to go on shore !
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 40]: Now , sir , you may take this answer for yourself , and all the other midshipmen in the ship , that not one soul of you puts his foot on shore until we are again all a-taunto . ''
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 73]: `` Allow me to observe , sir , '' said our hero , `` that it is very true that all our services may be required when the duty commences , but this being Saturday night , and to-morrow Sunday , the frigate will not be even moved till Monday morning ; and as the work can not begin before that , I trust you will permit leave until that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 14]: `` My opinion is different , sir , '' replied the first lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 18]: `` Perhaps , sir , you will allow me to argue the point , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 25]: `` No , sir , I never allow argument ; walk over to the other side of the deck , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 17]: `` O certainly , sir , '' said Jack , `` if you wish it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 44]: Jack 's first idea was to go on shore without leave , but from this he was persuaded by Gascoigne , who told him that it would displease Captain Wilson , and that old Tom , the Governor , would not receive him .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 69]: Jack agreed to this , and then , after a flourish about the rights of man , tyranny , oppression , and so forth , he walked forward to the forecastle , where he found his friend Mesty , who had heard all that had passed , and who insidiously said to him in a low tone -- `` Why you stay at sea , Massa Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 25]: `` Why , indeed , '' thought Jack , boiling with indignation ; `` to be cooped up here at the will of another ?
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 18]: I am a fool -- Mesty is right -- I 'll ask for my discharge to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 15]: Jack went down below , and told Gascoigne what he had determined to do .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 31]: `` You 'll do no such thing , Jack , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` depend upon it , you 'll have plenty of leave in a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 16]: Pottyfar was in a pet with the chaplain , who was too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 11]: Captain Wilson will be on board by nine o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 130]: Nevertheless , Jack walked his first watch in the magnificents , as all Biddies do when they can not go on shore , and turned in at twelve o'clock with the resolution of sticking to his purpose , and quitting his majesty 's service ; in fact , of presenting his Majesty with his between two and three years ' time , served as midshipman , all free , gratis , and for nothing , except his provisions and his pay , which some captains are bold enough to assert that they not only are not worth , but not even the salt that accompanies it ; forgetting that they were once midshipmen themselves , and at the period were , of course , of about the same value .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 80]: The next morning Captain Wilson came off ; the ship 's company were mustered , the service read by Mr Hawkins , and Jack , as soon as all the official duties were over , was about to go up to the captain , when the captain said to him , -- `` Mr Easy , the Governor desired me to bring you on shore to dine with him , and he has a bed at your service . ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 15]: Jack touched his hat and ran down below , to make his few preparations .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 46]: By the time that Mesty , who had taken charge of his chest , etc , had put his necessaries in the boat , Jack had almost made up his mind that his Majesty should not be deprived yet awhile of so valuable an officer .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 70]: Jack returned on deck , and found that the captain was not yet ready ; he went up to Mr Pottyfar , and told him that the captain had ordered him to go on shore with him ; and Mr Pottyfar , who had quite got over his spleen , said , -- `` Very well , Mr Easy -- I wish you a great deal of pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 20]: `` This is very different from yesterday , '' thought Jack ; `` suppose I try the medicine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 37]: `` I am not very well , Mr Pottyfar , and those pills of the doctor 's do n't agree with me -- I always am ill if I am long without air and exercise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 17]: `` Very true , '' said the first lieutenant , `` people require air and exercise .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 24]: I 've no opinion of the doctor 's remedies ; the only thing that is worth a farthing is the universal medicine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 53]: `` I should so long to try it , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` I read the book one day , and it said that if you took it daily for a fortnight or three weeks , and with plenty of air and exercise , it would do wonders . ''
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 37]: `` And it 's very true , '' replied Mr Pottyfar ; `` and if you 'd like to try it you shall -- I have plenty -- shall I give you a dose now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 31]: `` If you please , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` and tell me how often I am to take it , for my head aches all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 56]: Mr Pottyfar took Jack down , and putting into his hand three or four bottles of the preparation , told him that he was to take thirty drops at night , when he went to bed , not to drink more than two glasses of wine , and to avoid the heat of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 50]: `` But , sir , '' replied Jack , who had put the bottles in his pocket , `` I am afraid that I can not take it long ; for as the ship is ready for fitting , I shall be exposed to the sun all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 32]: `` Yes , if you are wanted , Mr Easy ; but we have plenty here without you ; and when you are unwell you can not be expected to work .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 25]: Take care of your health ; and I trust , indeed I am sure , that you will find this medicine wonderfully efficacious . ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 26]: `` I will begin to-night , sir , if you please , '' replied Jack , `` and I am very much obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 16]: I sleep at the Governor 's -- shall I come on board to-morrow morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 25]: `` No , no ; take care of yourself , and get well ; I shall be glad to hear that you get better .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 8]: Send me word how it acts . ''
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 32]: `` I will , sir , send you word by the boat every day , '' replied Jack , delighted ; `` I am very much obliged to you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 45]: Gascoigne and I were thinking of asking you , but did not like to do so : he , poor fellow , suffers from headaches almost as bad as I do , and the doctor 's pills are of no use to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 16]: `` He shall have some too , Mr Easy ; I thought he looked pale .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 8]: I 'll see to it this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 16]: Recollect , moderate exercise , Mr Easy , and avoid the sun at midday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 23]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Jack , `` I 'll not forget '' ; and off went Jack , delighted .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 56]: He ordered Mesty to put up his whole portmanteau instead of the small bundle he put into the boat , and telling Gascoigne what a spoke he had put into his wheel , was soon in the boat with the captain , and went on shore , where he was cordially greeted by the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 29]: CHAPTER XXVII In which Captain Wilson is repaid with interest for Jack 's borrowing his name , proving that a good name is as good as a legacy .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 18]: `` Well , Jack , my boy , have you any long story ready for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 4]: inquired the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 20]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Jack , `` I have one or two very good ones . ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 16]: `` Very well , we 'll hear them after dinner , '' replied old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 13]: `` In the meantime find out your room and take possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 16]: `` That must not be for very long , Governor , '' observed Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 17]: `` Mr Easy must learn his duty , and there is a good opportunity now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 20]: `` If you please , sir , '' replied Jack , `` I 'm on the sick list . ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 23]: `` Sick list , '' said Captain Wilson ; `` you were not in the report I was given this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 24]: `` No , I 'm on Mr Pottyfar 's list , and I 'm going through a course of the universal medicine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 13]: `` What 's all this , Jack , what 's all this ?
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 6]: There 's some story here .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 20]: Do n't be afraid of the captain -- you 've me to back you , '' said the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 58]: Jack was not at all afraid of the captain , so he told him how the first lieutenant had refused him leave the evening before , and how he had now given him permission to remain , and try the universal medicine , at which the Governor laughed heartily , nor could Captain Wilson refrain from joining .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 38]: `` But , Mr Easy , '' replied the captain , after a pause , `` if Mr Pottyfar will allow you to stay on shore , I can not -- you have your duty to learn .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 23]: You must be aware that now is your time , and you must not lose opportunities that do not occur every day .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 11]: You must acknowledge the truth of what I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 42]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Jack , `` I admit it all , provided I do intend to follow the profession '' ; and so saying our hero bowed , and left the veranda where they had been talking .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 39]: This hint of Jack 's , thrown out by him , more with the intention of preventing his being sent on board than with any definite idea , was not lost upon either the captain or the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 8]: `` Does he jib , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 4]: observed the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 22]: `` On the contrary , I never knew him more attentive , and so entirely getting rid of his former notions .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 32]: He has behaved most nobly in the gale , and there has not been one complaint against him -- I never was more astonished -- he must have meant something . ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 25]: `` I 'll tell you what he means , Wilson -- that he does not like to be sent on board , nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 19]: He 's not to be cooped up -- you may lead him , but not drive him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 11]: `` Yes but the service will not admit of it .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 22]: I never could allow it -- he must do his duty like the rest , and conform to the rules . ''
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 80]: `` Exactly , so he must ; but look ye , Wilson , you must not lose him : it 's all easily settled -- appoint him your orderly midshipman to and from the ship , that will be employment , and he can always remain here at night I will tell him that I have asked , as a favour , what I now do , and leave me to find out what he is thinking about . ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 32]: `` It may be done that way certainly '' , replied Captain Wilson , musing `` and you are more likely , to get his intentions from him than I am .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 34]: I am afraid he has too great a command of money ever to be fond of the ship ; it is the ruin of a junior officer to be so lavishly supplied . ''
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 25]: `` He 's a long way from ruin yet , Wilson -- he 's a very fine fellow , even by your own acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 29]: You humoured him out of gratitude to his father , when he first came into the service ; humour him a little now to keep him in it .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 27]: Besides , if your first lieutenant is such a fool with his universal medicine , can you wonder at a midshipman taking advantage of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 19]: `` No , but I ought not to allow him to do so with my eyes open . ''
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 53]: `` He has made it known to you upon honour , and you ought not to take advantage of his confidence : but still what I proposed would , I think , be the best , for then he will be at his duty in a way that will suit all parties .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 33]: You , because you employ him on service -- the first lieutenant , because Jack can take his medicine -- and Jack , because he can dine with me every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 45]: `` Well , I suppose it must be so , '' replied Captain Wilson , laughing ; `` but still , I trust , you will discover what is working in his mind to induce him to give me that answer , Governor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 25]: `` Never fear , Jack shall confess , and lay his soul as bare as that of a Catholic bigot before his padre . ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 23]: The party sat down to dinner , and what with the Governor 's aide-de-camp and those invited , it was pretty numerous .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 101]: After the cloth had been removed , the Governor called upon Jack for his stories , whereupon , much to the surprise of Captain Wilson , who had never heard one word of it , for the Admiral had not mentioned anything about it to him during the short time the Aurora was with the Toulon fleet , our hero gave the Governor and the company the narrative of all that happened in the Mary Ann transport -- the loves of Captain Hogg and Miss Hicks-the adventures of Gascoigne -- and his plan , by which he baulked them all .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 13]: The Governor was delighted , and Captain Wilson not a little astonished .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 38]: `` You prevented a very foolish thing , Mr Easy , and behaved very well , '' observed the captain , laughing again at the idea ; `` but you never told me of all this . ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 39]: `` No , sir , '' replied Jack , `` I have always reserved my stories for the Governor 's table , where I am sure to meet you , and then telling once does for all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 46]: Jack received his appointment as orderly midshipman , and everything went on well ; for , of his own accord , he stayed on board the major part of the day to learn his duty , which very much pleased the captain and Mr Pottyfar .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 25]: In this Jack showed a great deal of good sense , and Captain Wilson did not repent of the indulgence he had shown him .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 25]: Jack 's health improved daily , much to Mr Pottyfar 's satisfaction , who imagined that he took the universal medicine night and morning .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 29]: Gascoigne also was a patient under the first lieutenant 's hands , and often on shore with our hero , who thought no more of quitting the service .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 51]: For seven weeks they had now remained in harbour , for even the masts had to be made , when , one day , Captain Wilson opened a letter he received at breakfast-time , and having read it , laid it down with the greatest surprise depicted in his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 9]: `` Good heavens what can this mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , Wilson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 4]: said the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 10]: `` Just hear its contents , Sir Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 66]: Captain Wilson then read in Spanish as follows : -- `` HONOURABLE SIR , `` It is my duty to advise you that the Honourable Lady Senora Alforgas de Cuzman , now deceased , has , in her testament bequeathed to you the sum of one thousand doubloons in gold as a testimony of your kind services on the night of the 12th of August .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 28]: If you will authorise any merchant here to receive the money , it shall be paid forthwith , or remitted in any way you please to appoint .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 7]: May you live a thousand years !
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 11]: `` Your most obedient servant , `` ALFONZO XEREZ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 35]: Jack heard the letter read , rose quietly , whistled low , as if not attending to it , and then slipped out of the room , unperceived by the Governor or Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 50]: The fact was , that although Jack had longed to tell the Governor about his adventures after the masquerade , he did not like yet awhile , until he was sure that there were no consequences -- because he had given the captain 's name instead of his own .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 50]: As soon as he heard the letter read , he at once perceived that it had been the old lady , and not the priests , who had made the inquiry , and that by giving Captain Wilson 's name , he had obtained for him this fine legacy .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 20]: Jack was delighted , but still puzzled , so he walked out of the room to reflect a little .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 7]: `` What can it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 4]: said Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 17]: `` I never rendered any services to anyone on the 12th of August or after it .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 19]: It is some mistake -- 12th of August -- that was the day of the grand masquerade . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 27]: `` A lucky one for you , at all events -- for you know , mistake or not , no one else can touch the legacy .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 9]: It can only be paid to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 28]: `` I never heard of anything taking place at the masquerade -- I was there , but I left early , for I was not very well .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 16]: Mr Easy , '' said Captain Wilson , turning round ; but Jack was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 8]: `` Was he at the masquerade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 4]: asked the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 28]: `` Yes , I know he was , for the first lieutenant told me that he requested not to come on board till the next day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 28]: `` Depend upon it , '' replied the Governor , striking his fist upon the table , `` that Jack 's at the bottom of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 22]: `` I should not be surprised at his being at the bottom of anything , '' replied Captain Wilson , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 15]: `` Leave it to me , Wilson ; I 'll find it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 23]: After a little more conversation , Captain Wilson went on board , leaving Jack on purpose that the Governor might pump him .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 33]: But this Sir Thomas had no occasion to do , for Jack had made up his mind to make the Governor his confidant , and he immediately told him the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 26]: The Governor held his sides at our hero 's description , especially at his ruse of giving the captain 's name instead of his own .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 34]: `` You 'll kill me , Jack , before you 've done with me , '' said old Tom , at last ; `` but now , what is to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 40]: Our hero now became grave ; he pointed out to the Governor that he himself had plenty of money , and would come into a large fortune , and that Captain Wilson was poor , with a large family .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 19]: All Jack wanted the Governor to manage was , that Captain Wilson might consent to accept the legacy .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 7]: `` Right , boy , right !
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 37]: you 're my own boy , '' replied the Governor , `` but we must think of this , for Wilson is the very soul of honour , and there might be some difficulty about it .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 6]: You have told nobody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 11]: `` Not a soul but you , Sir Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 25]: `` It will never do to tell him all this , Jack , for he would insist that the legacy belonged to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 11]: `` I have it , sir , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 64]: `` When I was going into the masquerade I offered to hand this very old lady , who was covered with diamonds out of her carriage , and she was so frightened at my dress of the devil that she would have fallen down had it not been for Captain Wilson who supported her , and she was very thankful to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 26]: `` You are right , Jack , '' replied the Governor , after a short pause : `` that will , I think , do .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 29]: I must tell him the story of the friars , because I swore you had something to do with it -- but I 'll tell him no more .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 7]: Leave it all to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 15]: Captain Wilson returned in the afternoon , and found the Governor on the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 38]: `` I have had some talk with young Easy , '' said the Governor , `` and he has told me a strange story about that night , which he was afraid to tell to everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 13]: The Governor then narrated the history of the friars and the will .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 24]: `` Well , but , '' observed Captain Wilson , `` the history of that will afford no clue to the legacy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 20]: `` No it does not ; but still , as I said , Jack had a hand in this .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 34]: He frightened the old lady as a devil , and you caught her in your arms and saved her from falling , so he had a hand in it , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 36]: `` I do now remember that I did save a very dowager-like old personage from falling at the sight of a devil , who , of course , must have been our friend Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 13]: `` Well , and that accounts for the whole of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 12]: `` A thousand doubloons for picking up an old lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 6]: `` Yes , why not ?
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 29]: -- have you not heard of a man having a fortune left him for merely opening the pew door of a church , to an old gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 10]: `` Yes , but it appears so strange . ''
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 35]: `` There 's nothing strange in this world , Wilson , nothing at a We may slave for years and get no reward , and do a trifle out of politeness and become independent .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 9]: In my opinion , this mystery is unravelled .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 57]: The old lady , for I knew the family , must have died immensely rich : she knew you in your full uniform , and she asked your name ; a heavy fall would have been to one so fat a most serious affair ; you saved her , and she has rewarded you handsomely . ''
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 46]: `` Well , '' replied Captain Wilson , `` as I can give no other explanation , I suppose yours is the correct one ; but it 's hardly fair to take a thousand doubloons from her relations merely for an act of civility . ''
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 18]: `` You really are quite ridiculous ; the old lady owned half Murcia , to my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 19]: It is no more to them than anyone leaving you a suit of mourning in an English legacy .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 26]: I wish you joy ; it will help you with a large family , and in justice to them you are bound to take it .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 30]: Everybody does as he pleases with his own money , -- depend upon it , you saved her from breaking her leg short off at the hip joint . ''
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 20]: `` Upon that supposition I presume I must accept of the legacy , '' replied Captain Wilson , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 10]: `` Of course ; send for it at once .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 8]: The rate of exchange is now high .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 17]: I will give you government bills , which will make it nearly four thousand pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 17]: `` Four thousand pounds for preventing an old woman from falling , '' replied Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 13]: `` Devilish well paid , Wilson , and I congratulate you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 15]: `` For how much am I indebted to the father of young Easy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 61]: observed Captain Wilson , after a silence of some minutes ; `` if he had not assisted me when I was appointed to a ship , I should not have gained my promotion -- nor three thousand pounds I have made in prize-money -- the command of a fine frigate -- and now four thousand pounds in a windfall . ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 30]: The Governor thought that he was more indebted to Jack than to his father for some of these advantages , but he was careful not to point them out .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 81]: `` It 's very true , '' observed the Governor , `` that Mr Easy was of service to you when you were appointed ; but allow me to observe , that for your ship , your prize-money , and for your windfall , you have been wholly indebted to your own gallantry , in both senses of the word ; still Mr Easy is a fine generous fellow , and so is his son , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 14]: By-the-bye , I had a long conversation with him the other day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 5]: `` About himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 7]: `` Yes , all about himself .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 29]: He appears to me to have come into the service without any particular motive , and will be just as likely to leave it in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 15]: He appears to be very much in love with that Sicilian nobleman 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 21]: I find that he has written to her , and to her brother , since he has been here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 71]: `` That he came into the service in search of what he never will find in this world , I know very well ; and I presume that he has found that out -- and that he will follow up the service is also very doubtful ; but I do not wish that he should leave it yet , it is doing him great good , '' replied Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 21]: `` I agree with you there -- I have great influence with him , and he shall stay yet awhile .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 14]: He is heir to a very large fortune , is he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 14]: `` A clear eight thousand pounds a year , if not more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 28]: `` If his father dies he must , of course , leave ; a midshipman with eight thousand pounds a year would indeed be an anomaly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 8]: `` That the service could not permit .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 15]: It would be as injurious to himself as it would to others about him .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 20]: At present , he has almost , indeed I may say quite , an unlimited command of money . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 8]: `` That 's bad , very bad .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 11]: I wonder he behaves so well as he does . ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 35]: `` And so do I : but he really is a very superior lad , with all his peculiarities , and a general favourite with those whose opinions and friendship are worth having . ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 18]: `` Well , do n't curb him too tight -- for really he does not require it .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 9]: He goes very well in a snaffle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 35]: CHAPTER XXVIII `` Philosophy made Easy , '' upon agrarian principles , the subject of some uneasiness to our hero -- The first appearance , but not the last , of an important personage .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 16]: The conversation was here interrupted by a mail from England which they had been expecting .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 28]: Captain Wilson retired with his letters ; the Governor remained equally occupied ; and our hero received the first letter ever written to him by his father .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 35]: It ran as follows : -- `` MY DEAR SON , `` I have many times taken up my pen with the intention of letting you know how things went on in this country .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 32]: But as I can perceive around but one dark horizon of evil , I have as often laid it down again without venturing to make you unhappy with such bad intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 42]: `` The account of your death , and also of your unexpectedly being yet spared to us , were duly received , and I trust , I mourned and rejoiced on each occasion with all the moderation characteristic of a philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 93]: In the first instance I consoled myself with the reflection that the world you had left was in a state of slavery , and pressed down by the iron arm of despotism , and that to die was gain , not only in all the parson tells us , but also in our liberty ; and , at the second intelligence , I moderated my joy for nearly about the same reasons , resolving , notwithstanding what Dr Middleton may say , to die as I have lived , a true philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 46]: `` The more I reflect the more am I convinced that there is nothing required to make this world happy but equality , and the rights of man being duly observed -- in short , that everything and everybody should be reduced to one level .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 30]: Do we not observe that it is the law of nature -- do not brooks run into rivers -- rivers into seas -- mountains crumble down upon the plains ?
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 14]: -- are not the seasons contented to equalise the parts of the earth ?
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 30]: Why does the sun run round the ecliptic , instead of the equator , but to give an equal share of his heat to both sides of the world ?
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 9]: Are we not all equally born in misery ?
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 14]: does not death level us all aequo pede , as the poet hath ?
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 20]: are we not all equally hungry , thirsty , and sleepy , and thus levelled by our natural wants ?
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 29]: And such being the case , ought we not to have our equal share of good things in this world , to which we have undoubted equal right ?
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 19]: Can any argument be more solid or more level than this , whatever nonsense Dr Middleton may talk ?
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 88]: `` Yes , my son , if it were not that I still hope to see the sun of justice arise , and disperse the manifold dark clouds which obscure the land -- if I did not still hope , in my time , to see an equal distribution of property -- an Agrarian law passed by the House of Commons , in which all should benefit alike -- I would not care how soon I left this vale of tears , created by tyranny and injustice .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 61]: At present , the same system is carried on ; the nation is taxed for the benefit of the few , and it groans under oppression and despotism ; but I still do think that there is , if I may fortunately express myself , a bright star in the west ; and signs of the times which comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 114]: Already we have had a good deal of incendiarism about the country , and some of the highest aristocracy have pledged themselves to raise the people above themselves , and have advised sedition and conspiracy ; have shown to the debased and unenlightened multitude that their force is physically irresistible , and recommended them to make use of it , promising that if they hold in power , they will only use that power to the abolition of our farce of a constitution , of a church , and of a king ; and that if the nation is to be governed at all , it shall only be governed by the many .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 4]: This is cheering .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 5]: Hail , patriot lords !
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 3]: all hail !
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 40]: I am in hopes yet that the great work will be achieved , in spite of the laughs and sneers and shakes of the head , which my arguments still meet with from that obstinate fellow , Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 51]: `` Your mother is in a quiet way ; she has given over reading and working , and even her knitting , as useless ; and she now sits all day long at the chimney corner twiddling her thumbs , and waiting , as she says , for the millennium .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 3]: Poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 37]: she is very foolish with her ideas upon this matter , but as usual I let her have her own way in everything , copying the philosopher of old , who was tied to his Xantippe .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 46]: `` I trust , my dear son , that your principles have strengthened with your years and fortified with your growth , and that , if necessary , you will sacrifice all to obtain what in my opinion will prove to be the real millennium .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 27]: Make all the converts you can , and believe me to be , `` Your affectionate father , and true guide , `` Nicodemus Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 24]: Jack , who was alone , shook his head as he read this letter , and then laid it down with a pish !
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 19]: He did it involuntarily , and was surprised at himself when he found that he had so done .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 43]: `` I should like to argue the point , '' thought Jack , in spite of himself ; and then he threw the letter on the table , and went into Gascoigne 's room , displeased with his father and with himself .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 24]: He asked Ned whether he had received any letters from England , and , it being near dinner-time , went back to dress .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 52]: On his coming down into the receiving room with Gascoigne , the Governor said to them , -- `` As you both speak Italian , you must take charge of a Sicilian officer , who has come here with letters of introduction to me , and who dines here to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 32]: Before dinner they were introduced to the party in question , a slight-made , well-looking young man , but still there was an expression in his countenance which was not agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 45]: In compliance with the wishes of the Governor , Don Mathias , for so he was called , was placed between our two midshipmen , who immediately entered into conversation with him , being themselves anxious to make enquiries about their friends at Palermo .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 38]: In the course of conversation , Jack enquired of him whether he was acquainted with Don Rebiera , to which the Sicilian answered in the affirmative , and they talked about the different members of the family .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 78]: Don Mathias , towards the close of the dinner , enquired of Jack by what means he had become acquainted with Don Rebiera , and Jack , in reply , narrated how he and his friend Gascoigne had saved him from being murdered by two villains ; after this reply the young officer appeared to be less inclined for conversation , but before the party broke up , requested to have the acquaintance of our two midshipmen .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 56]: As soon as he was gone , Gascoigne observed in a reflective way , `` I have seen that face before , but where I can not exactly say ; but you know , Jack , what a memory of people I have , and I have seen him before , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 32]: `` I ca n't recollect that ever I have , '' replied our hero , `` but I never knew anyone who could recollect in that way as you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 51]: The conversation was then dropped between them , and Jack was for some time listening to the Governor and Captain Wilson , for the whole party were gone away , when Gascoigne , who had been in deep thought since he had made the observation to Jack , sprang up .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 8]: `` I have him at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 3]: cried he .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 5]: `` Have who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 4]: demanded Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 17]: `` That Sicilian officer -- I could have sworn that I had seen him before . ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 6]: `` That Don Mathias ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 6]: `` No , Sir Thomas !
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 6]: He is not Don Mathias !
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 23]: He is the very Don Silvio who was murdering Don Rebiera , when we came to his assistance and saved him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 11]: `` I do believe you are right , Gascoigne . ''
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 22]: `` I 'm positive of it , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` I never made a mistake in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 24]: `` Bring me those letters , Easy , '' said the Governor , `` and let us see what they say of him .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 9]: Here it is -- Don Mathias de Alayeres .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 21]: You may be mistaken , Gascoigne ; it is a heavy charge you are making against this young man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 27]: `` Well , Sir Thomas , if that is not Don Silvio , I 'd forfeit my commission if I had it here in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 44]: Besides , I observed the change in his countenance when we told him it was Easy and I who had come to Don Rebiera 's assistance ; and did you observe after that , Easy , that he hardly said a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 8]: `` Very true , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 30]: `` Well , well , we must see to this , '' observed the Governor ; `` if so , this letter of introduction must be a forgery . ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 33]: The party then retired to bed , and the next morning , while Easy was in Gascoigne 's room talking over their suspicions , letters from Palermo were brought up to him .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 153]: They were in answer to those written by Jack on his arrival at Malta : a few lines from Don Rebiera , a small note from Agnes , and a voluminous detail from his friend Don Philip , who informed him of the good health of all parties , and of their good-will towards him ; of Agnes being as partial as ever ; of his having spoken plainly , as he had promised Jack , to his father and mother relative to the mutual attachment ; of their consent being given , and then withheld , because Father Thomaso , their confessor , would not listen to the union of Agnes with a heretic ; but nevertheless telling Jack that this would be got over through the medium of his brother and himself , who were determined that their sister and he should not be made unhappy about such a trifle .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 48]: But the latter part of the letter contained intelligence equally important , which was , that Don Silvio had again attempted the life of their father , and would have succeeded , had not Father Thomaso , who happened to be there , thrown himself between them .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 19]: That Don Silvio in his rage had actually stabbed the confessor , although the wound was not dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 33]: That in consequence of this , all further lenity was denied to him , and the authorities were in search of him to award him the punishment due to murder and sacrilege .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 29]: That up to the present they could not find him , and it was supposed that he had made his escape to Malta in one of the speronares .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 25]: Such were the contents of the letter , which were immediately communicated to the Governor and Captain Wilson , upon their meeting at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 30]: `` Very well , we must see to this , '' observed the Governor , who then made his enquiries as to the other intelligence contained in the letters .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 42]: Jack and Gascoigne were uneasy till the breakfast was over , when they made their escape : a few moments afterwards Captain Wilson rose to go on board , and sent for them , but they were not to be found .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 29]: `` I understand it all , Wilson , '' said the Governor ; `` leave them to me ; go on board and make yourself quite easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 27]: In the meantime our two midshipmen had taken their hats and walked away to the parapet of the battery , where they would not be interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 37]: `` Now , Gascoigne , '' observed Jack , `` you guess what I 'm about -- I must shoot that rascal this very morning , and that 's why I came out with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 33]: `` But , Easy , the only difference is this , that I must shoot him , and not you ; he is my property , for I found him out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 37]: `` We 'll argue that point , '' replied Jack : `` he has attempted the life of my is-to-be , please God , father-in-law , and therefore I have the best claim to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 17]: `` I beg your pardon , Jack , he is mine , for I discovered him .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 29]: Now let me put a case : suppose one man walking several yards before another , picks up a purse , what claim has the other to it ?
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 9]: I found him , and not you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 45]: `` That 's all very well , Gascoigne ; but suppose the purse you picked up to be mine , then I have a right to it , although you found it ; he is my bird by right , and not yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 58]: `` But I have another observation to make , which is very important ; he is a blood relation of Agnes , and if his blood is on your hands , however much he may deserve it , depend upon it , it will be raised as an obstacle to your union : think of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 5]: Jack paused in thought .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 21]: `` And let me induce you by another remark -- you will confer on me a most particular favour . ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 26]: `` It will be the greatest I ever could , '' replied Jack , `` and you ought to be eternally indebted to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 15]: `` I trust to make him eternally indebted to me , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 39]: Sailors , if going into action , always begin to reckon what their share of the prize-money may be , before a shot is fired -- our two midshipmen appear in this instance to be doing the same .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 37]: The point having been conceded to Gascoigne , Jack went to the inn where Don Silvio had mentioned that he had taken up his quarters , and sending up his card , followed the waiter upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 11]: The waiter opened the door , and presented the card .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 20]: `` Very well , '' replied Don Silvio , `` you can go down and show him up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 34]: Jack hearing these words , did not wait , but walked in , where he found Don Silvio very busy removing a hone upon which he had been whetting a sharp double-edged stiletto .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 85]: The Sicilian walked up to him , offering his hand with apparent cordiality ; but Jack , with a look of defiance , said , `` Don Silvio , we know you ; my object now is to demand , on the part of my friend , the satisfaction which you do not deserve , but which our indignation at your second attempt upon Don Rebiera induces us to offer ; for if you escape from him you will have to do with me .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 31]: On the whole , Don Silvio , you may think yourself fortunate , for it is better to die by the hands of a gentleman than by the gibbet . ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 50]: Don Silvio turned deadly pale -- his hand sought his stiletto in his bosom , but it was remaining on the table ; at last he replied , `` Be it so -- I will meet you when and where you please , in an hour from this . ''
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 15]: Jack mentioned the place of meeting , and then walked out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 33]: He and Gascoigne then hastened to the quarters of an officer they were intimate with , and having provided themselves with the necessary fire-arms , were at the spot before the time .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 17]: They waited for him till the exact time , yet no Don Silvio made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 17]: `` He 's off , '' observed Gascoigne ; `` the villain has escaped us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 34]: Half an hour over the time had passed , and still there was no sign of Gascoigne 's antagonist , but one of the Governor 's aides-de-camp was seen walking up to them .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 21]: `` Here 's Atkins , '' observed Jack ; `` that 's unlucky , but he wo n't interfere . ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 27]: `` Gentlemen , '' said Atkins , taking off his hat with much solemnity , `` the Governor particularly wishes to speak to you both . ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 18]: `` We ca n't come just now -- we 'll be there in half an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 13]: `` You must be there in three minutes , both of you .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 48]: Excuse me , my orders are positive -- and to see them duly executed I have a corporal and a file of men behind that wall -- of course , if you walk with me quietly there will be no occasion to send for their assistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 10]: `` This is confounded tyranny , '' cried Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 12]: `` Well may they call him ` King Tom . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' replied Atkins , `` and he governs here in ` rey absoluto ' so come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 34]: Jack and Gascoigne , having no choice , walked up to the government house , where they found Sir Thomas in the veranda , which commanded a view of the harbour and offing .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 31]: `` Come here , young gentlemen , '' said the Governor , in a severe tone ; `` do you see that vessel about two miles clear of the port ?
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 14]: Don Silvio is in it , going back to Sicily under a guard .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 12]: And now remember what I say as a maxim through life .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 16]: Fight with gentlemen , if you must fight , but not with villains and murderers .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 30]: By consenting to fight with a blackguard , you as much disparage your cloth and compromise your own characters , as by refusing to give satisfaction to a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 24]: `` There , go away , for I 'm angry with you , and do n't let me see you till dinner-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 22]: CHAPTER XXIX In which our hero sees a little more service , and is better employed than in fighting Don Silvio .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 24]: But before they met the Governor at his table , a sloop of war arrived from the fleet with despatches from the commander-in-chief .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 53]: Those to Captain Wilson required him to make all possible haste in fitting , and then to proceed and cruise off Corsica , to fall in with a Russian frigate which was on that coast ; if not there , to obtain intelligence , and to follow her wherever she might be .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 12]: All was now bustle and activity on board of the Aurora .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 26]: Captain Wilson , with our hero and Gascoigne , quieted the Governor 's house and repaired on board , where they remained day and night .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 22]: On the third day the Aurora was complete and ready for sea , and about noon sailed out of Valette Harbour .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 39]: In a week the Aurora had gained the coast of Corsica , and there was no need of sending look-out men to the mast-head , for one of the officers or midshipmen was there from daylight to dark .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 21]: She ran up the coast to the northward without seeing the object of her pursuit , or obtaining any intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 27]: Calms and light airs detained them for a few days , when a northerly breeze enabled them to run down the eastern side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 24]: It was on the eighteenth day after they had quieted Malta , that a large vessel was seen ahead about eighteen miles off .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 7]: The men were then at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 31]: `` A frigate , Captain Wilson , I 'm sure of it , '' said Mr Hawkins , the chaplain , whose anxiety induced him to go to the mast-head .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 7]: `` How is she steering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 9]: `` The same way as we are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 31]: The Aurora was under all possible sail , and when the hands were , piped to dinner , it was thought that they had neared the chase about two miles .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 20]: `` This will be a long chase ; a stern chase always is , '' observed Martin to Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 18]: `` Yes , I 'm afraid so -- but I 'm more afraid of her escaping . ''
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 12]: `` That 's not unlikely either , '' replied the mate .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 15]: `` You are one of Job 's comforters , Martin , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 14]: `` Then I 'm not so often disappointed , '' replied the mate .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 48]: `` There are two points to be ascertained ; the first is , whether we shall come up with the vessel or lose her -- the next is , if we do come up with her , whether she is the vessel we are looking for . ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 9]: `` You seem very indifferent about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 45]: `` Indeed I am not : I am the oldest passed midshipman in the ship , and the taking of the frigate will , if I live , give me my promotion , and if I 'm killed , I sha n't want it .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 21]: But I 've been so often disappointed , that I now make sure of nothing until I have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 38]: `` Well , for your sake , Martin , I will still hope that the vessel is the one we seek , that we shall not be killed , and that you will gain your promotion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 20]: `` I thank you , Easy -- I wish I was one that dared hope as you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 3]: Poor Martin !
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 14]: he had long felt how bitter it was to meet disappointment upon disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 13]: How true it is , that hope deferred maketh the heart sick !
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 61]: and his anticipations of early days , the buoyant calculations of youth , had been one by one crushed , and now , having served his time nearly three times over , the reaction had become too painful , and , as he truly said , he dared not hope : still his temper was not soured , but chastened .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 19]: `` She has hauled her wind , sir , '' hailed the second lieutenant from the topmast cross-trees .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 10]: `` What think you of that , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 3]: observed Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 26]: `` Either that she is an English frigate , or that she is a vessel commanded by a very brave fellow , and well-manned . ''
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 53]: It was sunset before the Aurora had arrived within two miles of the vessel ; the private signal had been thrown out , but had not been answered , either because it was too dark to make out the colours of the flags , or that these were unknown to an enemy .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 42]: The stranger had hoisted the English colours , but that was no satisfactory proof of her being a friend ; and just before dark she had put her head towards the Aurora , who had now come stem down to her .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 31]: The ship 's company of the Aurora were all at their quarters , as a few minutes would now decide whether they had to deal with a friend or foe .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 23]: There is no situation perhaps more difficult , and demanding so much caution , as the occasional meeting with a doubtful ship .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 48]: On the one hand , it being necessary to be fully prepared , and not allow the enemy the advantage which may be derived from your inaction ; and on the other , the necessity of prudence , that you may not assault your friends and countrymen .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 29]: Captain Wilson had hoisted the private night-signal , but here again it was difficult , from his sails intervening , for the other ship to make it out .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 50]: Before the two frigates were within three cables ' length of each other , Captain Wilson , determined that there should be no mistake from any want of precaution on his part , hauled up his courses and brailed up his driver that the night-signal might be clearly seen .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 59]: Lights were seen abaft on the quarter-deck of the other vessel , as if they were about to answer , but she continued to keep the Aurora to leeward at about half a cable 's length , and as the foremost guns of each vessel were abreast of each other , hailed in English -- `` Ship ahoy !
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 6]: what ship 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 18]: `` His Majesty 's ship Aurora , '' replied Captain Wilson , who stood on the hammocks .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 7]: `` What ship 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 70]: By this time the other frigate had passed half her length clear of the beam of the Aurora , and at the same time that a pretended reply of `` His Majesty 's ship -- '' was heard , a broadside from her guns , which had been trained aft on purpose , was poured into the Aurora , and at so short a distance , doing considerable execution .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 33]: The crew of the Aurora , hearing the hailing in English , and the vessel passing them apparently without firing , had imagined that she had been one of their own cruisers .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 64]: The captains of the guns had dropped their lanyards in disappointment , and the silence which had been maintained as the two vessels met was just breaking up in various ways of lamentation at their bad luck , when the broadside was poured in , thundering in their ears , and the ripping and tearing of the beams and planks astonished their senses .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 37]: Many were carried down below , but it was difficult to say whether indignation at the enemy 's ruse , or satisfaction at discovering that they were not called to quarters in vain , most predominated .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 26]: At all events , it was answered by three voluntary cheers , which drowned the cries of those who were being assisted to the cockpit .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 10]: `` Man the larboard guns and about ship ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 9]: cried Captain Wilson , leaping off the hammocks .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 13]: `` Look out , my lads , and rake her in stays !
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 16]: We 'll pay him off for that foul play before we 've done with him .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 16]: Look out , my lads , and take good aim as she pays round . ''
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 23]: The Aurora was put about , and her broadside poured into the stern of the Russian frigate -- for such she was .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 31]: It was almost dark , but the enemy , who appeared as anxious as the Aurora to come to action , hauled up her courses to await her coming up .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 33]: In five minutes the two vessels were alongside , exchanging murderous broadsides at little more than pistol-shot -- running slowly in for the land , then not more than five miles distant .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 27]: The skin-clad mountaineers of Corsica were aroused by the furious cannonading , watching the incessant flashes of the guns , and listening to their reverberating roar .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 109]: After half an hour 's fierce combat , during which the fire of both vessels was kept up with undiminished vigour , Captain Wilson went down on the main deck , and himself separately pointed each gun after it was loaded ; those amidships being direct for the main channels of the enemy 's ship , while those abaft the beam were gradually trained more and more forward , and those before the beam more and more aft , so as to throw all their shot nearly into one focus , giving directions that they were all to be fired at once , at the word of command .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 26]: The enemy , not aware of the cause of the delay , imagined that the fire of the Aurora had slackened , and loudly cheered .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 25]: At the word given , the broadside was poured in , and , dark as it was , the effects from it were evident .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 29]: Two of the midship ports of the antagonist were blown into one , and her mainmast was seen to totter , and then to fall over the side .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 69]: The Aurora then set her courses , which had been hauled up , and shooting ahead , took up a raking position , while the Russian was still hampered with her wreck , and poured in grape and cannister from her upper deck carronades to impede their labours on deck , while she continued her destructive fire upon the hull of the enemy from the main deck battery .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 23]: The moon now burst out from a low bank of clouds , and enabled them to accomplish their work with more precision .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 48]: In a quarter of an hour the Russian was totally dismasted , and Captain Wilson ordered half of his remaining ship 's company to repair the damages , which had been most severe , whilst the larboard men at quarters continued the fire from the main deck .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 50]: The enemy continued to return the fire from four guns , two on each of her decks , which she could still make bear upon the Aurora ; but after some time even these ceased , either from the men having deserted them , or from their being dismounted .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 41]: Observing that the fire from her antagonist had ceased , the Aurora also discontinued , and the jolly-boat astern being still uninjured , the second lieutenant was deputed to pull alongside of the frigate to ascertain if she had struck .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 71]: The beams of the bright moon silvered the rippling water as the boat shoved off ; and Captain Wilson and his officers , who were still unhurt , leant over the shattered sides of the Aurora , waiting for a reply : suddenly the silence of the night was broken upon by a loud splash from the bows of the Russian frigate , then about three cables ' length distant .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 7]: `` What could that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 4]: cried Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 6]: `` Her anchor 's down .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 17]: Mr Jones , a lead over the side , and see what water we have . ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 35]: Mr Jones had long been carried down below , severed in two with a round shot -- but a man leaped into the chains , and lowering down the lead sounded in seven fathoms .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 81]: `` Then I suspect he will give us more trouble yet , '' observed Captain Wilson ; and so indeed it proved , for the Russian captain , in reply to the second lieutenant , had told him in English , `` that he would answer that question with his broadside , '' and before the boat was dropped astern , he had warped round with the springs on his cable , and had recommenced his fire upon the Aurora .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 55]: Captain Wilson made sail upon his ship , and sailed round and round the anchored vessel , so as to give her two broadsides to her one , and from the slowness with which she worked at her springs upon her cables , it was evident that she must be now very weak handed .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 61]: Still the pertinacity and decided courage of the Russian captain convinced Captain Wilson , that , in all probability , he would sink at his anchor before he would haul down his colours ; and not only would he lose more of the Aurora 's men , but also the Russian vessel , without he took a more decided step .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 13]: Captain Wilson , therefore , resolved to try her by the board .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 31]: Having poured in a raking fire , he stood off for a few moments , during which he called the officers and men on deck , and stated his intention .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 43]: He then went about , and himself conning the Aurora , ran her on board the Russian , pouring in his reserved broadside as the vessels came into collision , and heading his men as they leaped on the enemy 's decks .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 62]: Although , as Captain Wilson had imagined , the Russian frigate had not many men to oppose to the Aurora 's , the deck was obstinately defended , the voice and the arm of the Russian captain were to be heard and seen everywhere , and his men , encouraged by him , were cut down by numbers where they stood .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 67]: Our hero , who had the good fortune to be still unhurt , was for a little while close to Captain Wilson when he boarded , and was about to oppose his unequal force against that of the Russian captain , when he was pulled back by the collar by Mr Hawkins , the chaplain , who rushed in advance with a sabre in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 44]: The opponents were well matched , and it may be said that , with little interruption , a hand-to-hand conflict ensued , for the moon lighted up the scene of carnage , and they were well able to distinguish each other 's faces .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 35]: At last , the chaplain 's sword broke : he rushed in , drove the hilt into his antagonist 's face , closed with him , and they both fell down the hatchway together .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 41]: After this , the deck was gained , or rather cleared , by the crew of the Aurora , for few could be said to have resisted , and in a minute or two the frigate was in their possession .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 34]: The chaplain and the Russian captain were hoisted up , still clinging to each other , both senseless from the fall , but neither of them dead , although bleeding from several wounds .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 43]: As soon as the main deck had been cleared , Captain Wilson ordered the hatches to be put on , and left a party on board while he hastened to attend to the condition of his own ship and ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 84]: It was daylight before anything like order had been restored to the decks of the Aurora ; the water was still smooth , and instead of letting go her own anchor , she had hung on with a hawser to the prize , but her sails had been furled , her decks cleared , guns secured , and the buckets were dashing away the blood from her planks and the carriages of the guns , when the sun rose and shone upon them .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 29]: The numerous wounded had , by this time , been put into their hammocks , although there were still one or two cases of amputation to be performed .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 77]: The carpenter had repaired all shot-holes under or too near to the water-line , and then had proceeded to sound the well of the prize ; but although her upper works had been dreadfully shattered , there was no reason to suppose that she had received any serious injury below , and , therefore the hatches still remained on , although a few hands were put to the pumps to try if she made any water .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 50]: It was not until the Aurora presented a more cheerful appearance that Captain Wilson went over to the other ship , whose deck , now that the light of heaven enabled them to witness all the horrors even to minuteness , presented a shocking spectacle of blood and carnage .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 67]: Body after body was thrown over ; the wounded were supplied with water and such assistance as could be rendered until the surgeons could attend them ; the hatches were then taken off , and the remainder of her crew ordered on deck ; about two hundred obeyed the summons , but the lower deck was as crowded with killed and wounded as was the upper .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 38]: For the present the prisoners were handed over down into the fore-hold of the Aurora , which had been prepared for their reception , and the work of separation of the dead from the living then underwent .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 39]: After this , such repairs as were immediately necessary were made , and a portion of the Aurora 's crew , under the orders of the second lieutenant , were sent on board to take charge of her .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 24]: It was not till the evening of the day after this night conflict that the Aurora was in a situation to make sail .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 30]: All hands were then sent on board of the Trident , for such was the name of the Russian frigate , to fit her out as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 48]: Before morning , -- for there was no relaxation from their fatigue , nor was there any wish for it , -- all was completed , and the two frigates , although in a shattered condition , were prepared to meet any common conflict with the elements .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 27]: The Aurora made sail with the Trident in tow ; the hammocks were allowed to be taken down , and the watch below permitted to repose .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 16]: In this murderous conflict the Trident had more than two hundred men killed and wounded .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 23]: The Aurora 's loss had not been so great , but still it was severe , having lost sixty-five men and officers .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 22]: Among the fallen there were Mr Jones , the master , the third lieutenant Mr Arkwright , and two midshipmen dead .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 17]: Mr Pottyfar , the first lieutenant , was severely wounded at the commencement of the action .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 21]: Martin the master 's mate , and Gascoigne , the first mortally , and the second badly , were wounded .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 27]: Our hero had also received a slight cutlass wound , which obliged him to wear his arm , for a short time , in a sling .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 49]: Among the ship 's company who were wounded was Mesty ; he had been hurt with a splinter before the Trident was taken by the board , but had remained on deck , and had followed our hero , watching over him and protecting him as a father .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 46]: He had done even more , for he had with Jack thrown himself before Captain Wilson , at a time that he had received such a blow with the flat of a sword as to stun him , and bring him down on his knee .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 60]: And Jack had taken good care that Captain Wilson should not be ignorant , as he really would have been , of this timely service on the part of Mesty , who certainly , although with a great deal of `` sangfroid '' in his composition when in repose , was a fiend incarnate when his blood was up .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 23]: `` But you must have been with Mesty , '' observed Captain Wilson , `` when he did me the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 25]: `` I was with him , sir , '' replied Jack , with great modesty ; `` but was of very little service . ''
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 10]: `` How is your friend Gascoigne this evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 17]: `` Oh , not very bad , sir -- he wants a glass of grog . ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 6]: `` And Mr Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 5]: Jack shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 12]: `` Why , the surgeon thinks he will do well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 31]: `` Yes , sir , and so I told Martin ; but he said that it was very well to give him hope -- but that he thought otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 20]: `` You must manage him , Mr Easy ; tell him that he is sure of his promotion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 13]: `` I have , sir , but he wo n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 12]: He never will believe it till he has his commission signed .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 16]: I really think that an acting order would do more than the doctor can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 13]: `` Well , Mr Easy , he shall have one to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 6]: Have you seen Mr Pottyfar ?
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 11]: he , I am afraid , is very bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 29]: `` Very bad , sir ; and they say is worse every day , and yet his wound is healthy , and ought to be doing well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 23]: Such was the conversation between Jack and his captain , as they sat at breakfast on the third morning after the action .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 19]: The next day Easy took down an acting order for Martin , and put it into his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 13]: The mate read it over as he lay bandaged in his hammock .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 22]: `` It 's only an acting order , Jack , '' said he ; `` it may not be confirmed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 26]: Jack swore , by all the articles of war , that it would be ; but Martin replied that he was sure it never would .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 22]: `` No , no , '' said the mate , `` I knew very well that I never should be made .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 22]: If it is not confirmed , I may live ; but if it is , I am sure to die . ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 32]: Everyone that went to Martin 's hammock wished him joy , of his promotion ; but six days after the action , poor Martin 's remains were consigned to the deep .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 74]: The next person who followed him was Mr Pottyfar , the first lieutenant , who had contrived , wounded as he was , to reach a packet of the universal medicine , and had taken so many bottles before he was found out , that he was one morning found dead in his bed , with more than two dozen empty phials under his pillow , and by the side of his mattress .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 32]: He was not buried with his hands in his pockets , but when sewed up in his hammock , they were , at all events , laid in the right position .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 19]: CHAPTER XXX Modern philanthropy , which , as usual , is the cause of much trouble and vexation .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 16]: In three weeks the Aurora , with her prize in tow , arrived at Malta .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 28]: The wounded were sent to the hospital , and the gallant Russian captain recovered from his wounds about the same time as Mr Hawkins , the chaplain .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 20]: Jack , who constantly called to see the chaplain , had a great deal to do to console him .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 16]: He would shake his hands as he lay in his bed , exclaiming against himself .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 20]: `` Oh , '' would he say , `` the spirit is willing , but the flesh is weak .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 53]: That I , a man of God , as they term me , who ought to have been down with the surgeons , whispering comfort to the desponding , should have gone on deck -LRB- but I could not help it -RRB- , and have mixed in such a scene of slaughter .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 7]: What will become of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 28]: Jack attempted to console him by pointing out , that not only chaplains , but bishops , have been known to fight in armour from time immemorial .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 17]: But Mr Hawkins 's recovery , was long doubtful , from the agitation of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 24]: When he was able to walk , Jack introduced to him the Russian captain , who was also just out of his bed .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 38]: `` I am most happy to embrace so gallant an officer , '' said the Russian , who recognised his antagonist , throwing his arms round the chaplain , and giving him a kiss on both cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 7]: `` What is his rank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 24]: continued he , addressing himself to Jack , who replied , very quietly , `` that he was the ship 's padre . ''
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 5]: `` The padre ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 14]: replied the captain , with surprise , as Hawkins turned away with confusion .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 7]: `` The padre -- par exemple !
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 12]: Well , I always had a great respect for the church .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 22]: Pray , sir , '' said he , turning to Easy , `` do your padres always head your boarders ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 33]: `` Always , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` it 's a rule of the service -- and the duty of a padre to show the men the way to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 9]: It 's our ninety-ninth article of war . ''
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 33]: `` You are a fighting nation , '' replied the Russian , bowing to Hawkins , and continuing his walk , not exactly pleased that he had been floored by a parson .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 36]: Mr Hawkins continued very disconsolate for some time ; he then invalided , and applied himself to his duties on shore , where he would not be exposed to such temptations from his former habits .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 53]: As the Aurora , when she was last at Malta , had nearly exhausted the dockyard for her repairs , she was even longer fitting out this time , during which Captain Wilson 's despatches had been received by the Admiral , and had been acknowledged by a brig sent to Malta .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 75]: The Admiral , in reply , after complimenting him upon his gallantry and success , desired that , as soon as he was ready , he should proceed to Palermo with communications of importance to the authorities , and having remained there for an answer , was again to return to Malta to pick up such of his men as might be fit to leave the hospital , and then join the Toulon fleet .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 24]: This intelligence was soon known to our hero , who was in ecstasies at the idea of again seeing Agnes and her brothers .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 26]: Once more the Aurora sailed away from the high crowned rocks of Valette , and with a fine breeze dashed through the deep blue waves .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 15]: But towards the evening the breeze increased , and they were under double-reefed topsails .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 43]: On the second day they made the coast of Sicily , not far from where Easy and Gascoigne had been driven on shore ; the weather was then more moderate , and the sea had , to a great degree , subsided .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 19]: They therefore stood in close to the coast , as they had not a leading wind to Palermo .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 37]: As they stood in , the glasses , as usual , were directed to land ; observing the villas with which the hills and valleys were studded , with their white fronts embowered in orange groves .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 16]: `` What is that , Gascoigne , '' said Easy , `` under that precipice ?
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 8]: -- it looks like a vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 29]: Gascoigne turned his glass in the direction -- `` Yes , it is a vessel on the rocks : by her prow she looks like a galley . ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 28]: `` It is a galley , sir -- one of the row galleys -- I can make out her bank of oars , '' observed the signal-man .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 12]: This was reported to Captain Wilson , who also examined her .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 23]: `` She is on the rocks , certainly , '' observed he ; `` and I think I see people on board .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 9]: Keep her away a point , quarter-master . ''
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 26]: The Aurora was now steered right for the vessel , and in the course of an hour was not more than a mile from her .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 41]: Their suppositions were correct -- it was one of the Sicilian government galleys bilged on the rocks , and they now perceived that there were people on board of her , making signals with their shirts and pieces of linen .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 41]: `` They must be the galley-slaves ; for I perceive that they do not one of them change their positions : the galley must have been abandoned by their officers and seamen , and the slaves left to perish . ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 26]: `` That 's very hard , '' observed Jack to Gascoigne ; `` they were condemned to the galleys , but not to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 35]: `` They will not have much mercy from the waves , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` they will all be in kingdom come to-morrow morning , if the breeze comes more on the land .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 11]: We have already come up two points this forenoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 93]: Although Captain Wilson did not join in this conversation , which he overheard as he stood on the forecastle gun , with his glass over the hammocks , it appears he was of the same opinion : but he demurred : he had to choose between allowing so many of his fellow creatures to perish miserably , or to let loose upon society a set of miscreants , who would again enter a course of crime until they were re-captured , and , by so doing , probably displease the Sicilian authorities .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 16]: After some little reflection he resolved that he would take his chance of the latter .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 26]: The Aurora was hove-to in stays , and the two cutters ordered to be lowered down , and the boat 's crew to be armed .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 32]: `` Mr Easy , do you take one cutter , and the armourers ; pull on board of the galley , release those people , and land them in small divisions .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 66]: Mr Gascoigne , you will take the other to assist Mr Easy , and when he lands them in his boat , you will pull by hit side ready to act , in case of any hostile attempt on the part of the scoundrels ; for we must not expect gratitude : of course , land them at the nearest safe spot for debarkation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 15]: In pursuance of these orders , our two midshipmen pulled away to the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 47]: They found her fixed hard upon the rocks , which had pierced her slight timbers , and , as they had supposed , the respectable part of her crew , with the commander , had taken to the boats , leaving the galley-slaves to their fate .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 11]: She pulled fifty oars , but had only thirty-six manned .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 47]: These oars were forty feet long , and ran in from the thole-pin with a loom six feet long , each manned by four slaves , who were chained to their seat before it , by a running chain made fast by a padlock in amidships .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 37]: A plank , of two feet wide , ran fore and aft the vessel between the two banks of oars , for the boatswain to apply the lash to those who did not sufficiently exert themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 6]: `` Viva los Inglesos ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 15]: cried the galley-slaves , as Easy climbed up over the quarter of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 18]: `` I say , Ned , did you ever see such a precious set of villains ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 15]: observed Easy , as he surveyed the faces of the men who were chained .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 32]: `` No , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` and I think if the captain had seen them as we have , that he would have left them where they were . ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 15]: `` I do n't know -- but , however , our orders are positive .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 21]: Armourer , knock off all the padlocks , beginning aft ; when we have a cargo we will land them .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 5]: How many are there ?
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 13]: -- twelve dozen -- twelve dozen villains to let loose upon society .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 38]: I have a great mind to go on board again and report my opinion to the captain -- one hundred and forty-four villains , who all deserve hanging -- for drowning is too good for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 11]: `` Our orders are to liberate them , Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 16]: `` Yes ; but I should like to argue this point with Captain Wilson . ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 26]: `` They 'll send after them fast enough , Jack , and they 'll all be in limbo again before long , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 22]: `` Well , I suppose we must obey orders ; but it goes against my conscience to save such villainous-looking rascals .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 6]: Armourer , hammer away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 34]: The armourer , who with the seamen appeared very much of Jack 's opinion , and had not commenced his work , now struck off the padlocks one by one with his sledgehammer .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 43]: As soon as they were released the slaves were ordered into the cutter , and when it was sufficiently loaded Jack shoved off , followed by Gascoigne as guard , and landed them at the point about a cable 's length distant .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 55]: It required six trips before they were all landed ; the last cargo were on shore , and Easy was desiring the men to shove off , when one of the galleriens turned round , and cried out to Jack in a mocking tone , `` Addio , signor , a reveder la . ''
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 22]: Jack started , stared , and , in the squalid , naked wretch who addressed him , he recognised Don Silvio !
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 38]: `` I will acquaint Don Rebiera of your arrival , signor , '' said the miscreant , springing up the rocks , and mixing with the rest , who now commenced hooting and laughing at their preservers .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 18]: `` Ned , '' observed Easy to Gascoigne , `` we have let that rascal loose . ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 19]: `` More 's the pity , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` but we have only obeyed orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 22]: `` It ca n't be helped , but I 've a notion there will be some mischief out of this . ''
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 9]: `` We obeyed orders , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 16]: `` We 've let the rascals loose not ten miles from Don Rebiera 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 7]: `` Obeyed orders , Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 15]: `` With a whole gang to back him , if he goes there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 6]: `` Orders , Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 15]: `` Agnes at his mercy -- '' `` Captain 's orders , Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 16]: `` I shall argue this point when I go on board , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 7]: `` Too late , Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' replied Easy , sinking down on the stem sheets with a look of despair .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 11]: `` Give way , my lads , give way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 43]: Jack returned on board , and reported what he had done : also that Don Silvio was among those liberated ; and he ventured to mention his fears of what might take place from their contiguity to the house of Don Rebiera .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 21]: Captain Wilson bit his lips : he felt that his philanthropy had induced him to act without his usual prudence .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 15]: `` I have done a rash thing , Mr Easy , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 16]: I should have taken them all on board and delivered them up to the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 9]: I wish I had thought of that before .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 20]: We must get to Palermo as fast as we can , and have the troops sent after these miscreants .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 11]: Hands ` bout ship , fill the main yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 22]: The wind had veered round , and the Aurora was now able to lay up clear of the island of Maritimo .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 41]: The next morning she anchored in Palermo Roads and gave immediate notice to the authorities , who , wishing Captain Wilson 's philanthropy at the devil , immediately despatched a large body of troops in quest of the liberated malefactors .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 31]: Captain Wilson , feeling for Jack 's anxiety about his friends , called him over to him on deck , and gave him and Gascoigne permission to go on shore .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 18]: `` Will you allow me to take Mesty with me , sir , if you please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 3]: said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 29]: `` Yes , Mr Easy ; but recollect that , even with Mesty , you are no match for one hundred and fifty men ; so be prudent .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 15]: I send you to relieve your anxiety , not to run into danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 41]: `` Of course , sir , '' replied Jack , touching his hat , and walking away quietly till he came to the hatchway , when he darted down like a shot , and was immediately occupied with his preparations .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 34]: In half an hour our two midshipmen , with Mesty , had landed , and proceeded to the inn where they had put up before : they were armed up to the teeth .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 11]: Their first inquiries were for Don Philip and his brother .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 20]: `` Both on leave of absence , '' replied the landlord , `` and staying with Don Rebiera . ''
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 10]: `` That 's some comfort , '' thought Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 12]: `` Now we must get horses as fast as we can .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 7]: Mesty , can you ride ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 24]: `` By all de power , can I ride , Massa Easy ; suppose you ride Kentucky horse , you ride anyting . ''
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 33]: In half an hour four horses and a guide were procured , and at eight o'clock in the morning the party set off in the direction of Don Rebiera 's country seat .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 26]: They had not ridden more than six miles when they came up with one of the detachments sent out in pursuit of the liberated criminals .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 39]: Our hero recognised the commanding officer as an old acquaintance , and imparting to him the release of Don Silvio , and his fears upon Don Rebiera 's account , begged him to direct his attention that way .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 32]: `` Corpo di Bacco -- you are right , Signor Mid , '' replied the officer , `` but Don Philip is there , and his brother too , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 19]: I will be there by ten o'clock to-morrow morning ; we will march almost the whole night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 10]: `` They have no arms , '' observed Easy .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 33]: `` No , but they will soon get them : they will go to some small town in a body , plunder it , and then seek the protection of the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 10]: Your captain has given us a pretty job . ''
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 38]: Jack exchanged a few more words , and then , excusing himself on account of his haste , put the spurs to his horse and regained his own party , who now proceeded at a rapid pace .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 5]: `` O signor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 12]: said the guide , `` we shall kill the horses . ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 11]: `` I 'll pay for them , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 31]: `` Yes , but we shall kill them before we get there , Jack , '' replied Gascoigne , `` and have to walk the rest of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 18]: `` Very true , Ned ; let 's pull up , and give them their wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 33]: `` By de holy poker , Massa Easy , but my shirt stick to my ribs , '' cried Mesty , whose black face was hung with dewdrops from their rapid course .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 7]: `` Never mind , Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 18]: It was about five o'clock in the afternoon when they arrived at the seat of Don Rebiera .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 18]: Jack threw himself off his jaded steed , and hastened into the house , followed by Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 32]: They found the whole family collected in the large sitting-room , quite ignorant of any danger threatening them , and equally astonished and pleased at the arrival of their old friends .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 25]: Jack flew to Agnes , who screamed when she saw him , and felt so giddy afterwards that he was obliged to support her .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 19]: Having seated her again , he was kindly greeted by the old people and the two young officers .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 19]: After a few minutes dedicated to mutual inquiries , our hero stated the cause of their expeditious arrival .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 19]: `` Don Silvio with one hundred and fifty galleriens , let loose on the coast yesterday afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 19]: exclaimed Don Rebiera ; `` you are right , I only wonder they were not here last night .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 25]: But I expect Pedro from the town ; he has gone down with a load of wine : he will bring us intelligence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 29]: `` At all events , we must be prepared , '' said Don Philip ; `` the troops , you say , will be here to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 5]: `` Holy Virgin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 8]: exclaimed the ladies , in a breath .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 8]: `` How many can we muster ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 3]: said Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 39]: `` We have five men here , or we shall have by the evening , '' replied Don Philip -- `` all , I think , good men -- my father , my brother , and myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 17]: `` We are three -- four with the guide , whom I know nothing about . ''
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 32]: `` Twelve in all -- not one too many ; but I think that now we are prepared , if they attack , we can hold out till the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 11]: `` Had we not better send the ladies away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 3]: said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 8]: `` Who is to escort them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 24]: replied Don Philip ; `` we shall only weaken our force ; besides , they may fall into the miscreants ' hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 9]: `` Shall we all leave the house together ?
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 11]: they can but plunder it , '' observed Don Rebiera .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 44]: `` Still , we may be intercepted by them , and our whole force will be nothing against so many , '' observed Don Philip , `` if we are without defence , whereas in the house we shall have an advantage . ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 33]: `` E'vero , '' replied Don Rebiera , thoughtfully ; `` then let us prepare , for depend upon it Don Silvio will not lose such an opportunity to wreak his vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 19]: He will be here to-night : I only wonder he has not been here with his companions before .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 10]: However , Pedro will arrive in two hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 16]: `` We must now see what means we have of defence , '' said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 12]: `` Come , brother -- will you come , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 39]: CHAPTER XXXI A regular set-to , in which the parties beaten are not knocked down , but rise higher and higher at each discomfiture -- Nothing but the troops could have prevented them from going up to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 27]: Don Rebiera and his two sons quitted the room , Gascoigne entered into conversation with the senora , while Easy took this opportunity of addressing Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 16]: He had been too much occupied with the consultation to pay her much attention before .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 28]: He had spoken , with his eyes fixed upon her , and had been surprised at the improvement which had taken place in less than a year .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 24]: He now went to her , and asked her , in a low voice , `` whether she had received his letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 5]: replied she , colouring .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 13]: `` And were you angry with what I said , Agnes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 5]: in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 15]: `` No , '' replied she , casting her eyes down on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 17]: `` I repeat now what I said , Agnes -- I have never forgotten you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 9]: `` But -- '' `` But what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 5]: `` Father Thomaso . ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 6]: `` What of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 11]: `` He never will -- '' `` Will what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 10]: `` You are a heretic , he says . ''
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 10]: `` Tell him to mind his own business . ''
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 12]: `` He has great influence with my father and mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 9]: `` Your brothers are on our side . ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 12]: `` I know that , but there will be great difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 7]: Our religion is not the same .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 12]: He must talk to you -- he will convert you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 9]: `` We 'll argue that point , Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 21]: I will convert him if he has common sense ; if not , it 's no use arguing with him .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 5]: Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 9]: `` He will soon be at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 19]: `` Tell me , Agnes , if you had your own will , would you marry me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 17]: `` I do n't know ; I have never seen anyone I liked so well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 6]: `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 12]: `` Is it not enough for a maiden to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 11]: replied Agnes , raising her eyes , and looking reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 13]: `` Signor , let me go , here comes my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 42]: Notwithstanding , Jack cast his eyes to the window , where Gascoigne and the senora were in converse , and , perceiving that the old lady 's back was turned , he pressed Agnes to his bosom before he released her .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 15]: The gentlemen then returned with all the fire-arms and destructive weapons they could collect .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 22]: `` We have enough , '' observed Don Philip , `` to arm all the people we have with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 18]: `` And we are well armed , '' replied Jack , who had left Agnes standing alone .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 8]: `` What now are your plans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 8]: `` Those we must now consult about .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 32]: It appears -- '' but at this moment the conversation was interrupted by the sudden entrance of Pedro , who had been despatched to the town with the load of wine .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 16]: He rushed in , flurried and heated , with his red cap in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 11]: `` How now , Pedro , back so early ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 5]: `` O signor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 26]: exclaimed the man -- `` they have taken the cart and the wine , and have drawn it away , up to the mountains . ''
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 4]: inquired Don Rebiera .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 67]: `` The galley-slaves who have been let loose -- and by the body of our blessed saint , they have done pretty mischief -- they have broken into the houses , robbed everything -- murdered many -- clothed themselves with the best -- collected all the arms , provisions , and wine they could lay their hands on , and have marched away into the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 6]: This took place last night .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 35]: As I was coming down within a mile of the town , they met me with my loaded cart , and they turned the bullocks round and drove them away along with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 5]: By the blessed Virgin !
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 23]: but they are stained with blood , but not altogether of men , for they have cut up some of the oxen .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 21]: I heard this from one of the herdsmen , but he too fled , and could not tell me more .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 12]: But , signor , I heard them mention your name . ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 13]: `` I have no doubt of it , '' replied Don Rebiera .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 18]: `` As for the wine , I only hope they will drink too much of it to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 28]: But , Pedro , they will be here , and we must defend ourselves -- so call the men together ; I must speak to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 15]: `` We shall never see the bullocks again , '' observed Pedro , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 19]: `` No : but we shall never see one another again , if we do not take care .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 9]: I have information they come here to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 5]: `` Holy Saint Francis !
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 11]: and they say there are a thousand of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 14]: `` Not quite so many , to my knowledge , '' observed Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 23]: `` They told me that a great many were killed in their attack upon the town , before they mastered it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 6]: `` So much the better .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 19]: Go now , Pedro , drink a cup of wine , and then call the other men . ''
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 31]: The house was barricaded as well as circumstances would permit ; the first story was also made a fortress by loading the landing place with armoires and chests of drawers .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 36]: The upper story , or attic , if it might be so called , was defended in the same way , that they might retreat from one to the other if the doors were forced .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 45]: It was eight o'clock in the evening before all was ready , and they were still occupied with the last defence , under the superintendence of Mesty , who showed himself an able engineer , when they heard the sound of an approaching multitude .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 25]: They looked out of one of the windows , and perceived the house surrounded by the galley-slaves , in number apparently about a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 33]: They were all dressed in a most fantastic manner with whatever they could pick up : some had fire-arms , but the most of them were supplied with only swords or knives .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 52]: With them came also their cortege of plunder : carts of various descriptions , loaded with provisions of all sorts , and wine ; women lashed down with ropes , sails from the vessels and boats to supply them with covering in the mountains , hay and straw , and mattresses .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 11]: Their plunder appeared to be well chosen for their exigencies .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 18]: To the carts were tied a variety of cattle , intended to accompany them to their retreat .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 29]: They all appeared to be under a leader , who was issuing directions -- that leader was soon recognised by those in the house to be Don Silvio .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 33]: `` Massa Easy , you show me dat man , '' said Mesty , when he heard the conversation between Easy and the Rebieras ; `` only let me know him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 17]: `` Do you see him there , Mesty , walking down in front of those men ?
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 19]: He has a musket in his hand , a jacket with silver buttons , and white trousers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 21]: `` Yes , Massa Easy , me see him well -- let me look little more -- dat enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 25]: The galley-slaves appeared to be very anxious to surround the house that no one should escape , and Don Silvio was arranging the men .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 17]: `` Ned , '' said Jack , `` let us show him that we are here .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 24]: He said that he would acquaint Don Rebiera with our arrival -- let us prove to him that he is too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 43]: `` It would not be a bad plan , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` if it were possible that these fellows had any gratitude among them , some of them might relent at the idea of attacking those who saved them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 42]: `` Not a bit ; but it will prove to them that there are more in the house than they think for ; and we can frighten some of them by telling them that the soldiers are near at hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 19]: Jack immediately threw up the casement , and called out in a loud voice , `` Don Silvio !
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 2]: galley-slave !
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 4]: Don Silvio ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 24]: The party hailed turned round , and beheld Jack , Gascoigne , and Mesty , standing at the window of the upper floor .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 16]: `` We have saved you the trouble of announcing us , '' called out Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 9]: `` We are here to receive you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 24]: `` And in three hours the troops will be here , so you must be quick , Don Silvio , '' continued Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 17]: `` A reveder la , '' continued Gascoigne , letting fly his pistol at Don Silvio .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 7]: The window was then immediately closed .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 22]: The appearance of our heroes , and their communication of the speedy arrival of the troops , was not without effect .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 50]: The criminals trembled at the idea ; Don Silvio was mad with rage he pointed out to the men the necessity of immediate attack -- the improbability of the troops arriving so soon , and the wealth which he expected was locked up by Don Rebiera in his mansion .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 32]: This rallied them , and they advanced to the doors , which they attempted to force without success , losing several men by the occasional fire from those within the house .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 92]: Finding their efforts , after half an hour 's repeated attempts , to be useless , they retreated , and then bringing up a long piece of timber , which required sixty men to carry it , they ran with it against the door , and the weight and impetus of the timber drove it off its hinges , and an entrance was obtained ; by this time it was dark , the lower story had been abandoned , but the barricade at the head of the stairs opposed their progress .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 47]: Convenient loop-holes had been prepared by the defenders , who now opened a smart fire upon the assailants , the latter having no means of returning it effectually , had they had ammunition for their muskets , which fortunately they had not been able to procure .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 49]: The combat now became fierce , and the galley-slaves were several times repulsed with great loss during a contest of two hours ; but , encouraged by Don Silvio , and refreshed by repeated draughts of wine , they continued by degrees removing the barriers opposed to them .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 22]: `` We shall have to retreat , '' exclaimed Don Rebiera ; `` very soon they will have torn down all .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 9]: What do you think , Signor Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 9]: `` Hold this as long as we can .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 8]: How are we off for ammunition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 16]: `` Plenty as yet -- plenty to last for six hours , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 9]: `` What do you say , Mesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 24]: `` By holy St Patrig , I say hold out here -- they got no fire-arms and we ab um at arm-length . ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 32]: This decision was the occasion of the first defence being held for two hours more , an occasional relief being afforded by the retreat of the convicts to the covered carts .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 45]: At last it was evident that the barricade was no longer tenable , for the heavy pieces of furniture they had heaped up to oppose entrance , were completely hammered to fragments by poles brought up by the assailants , and used as battering-rams .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 47]: The retreat was sounded ; they all hastened to the other story , where the ladies were already placed , and the galley-slaves were soon in possession of the first floor -- exasperated by the defence , mad with wine and victory , but finding nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 37]: Again was the attack made upon the second landing , but , as the stairs were now narrower , and their defences stronger in proportion , they , for a long while , gained no advantage .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 16]: On the contrary , many of their men were wounded , and taken down below .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 21]: The darkness of the night prevented both parties from seeing distinctly , which was rather in favour of the assailants .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 40]: Many climbed over the fortress of piled-up furniture , and were killed as soon as they appeared on the other side , and , at last , the only ammunition used was against those who made this rash attempt .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 43]: For four long hours did this assault and defence continue , until daylight came , and then the plan of assault was altered : they again brought up the poles , hammered the pieces of furniture into fragments , and gained ground .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 96]: The defenders were worn out with fatigue , but flinched not ; they knew that their lives , and the lives of those dearest to them , were at stake , and they never relaxed their exertions ; still the criminals , with Silvio at their head , progressed , the distance between the parties gradually decreased , and there was but one massive chest of drawers now defending the landing-place , and over which there was a constant succession of blows from long poles and cutlasses , returned with the bullets from their pistols .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 24]: `` We must now fight for our lives , '' exclaimed Gascoigne to Easy , `` for what else can we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 3]: `` Do ?
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 15]: -- get on the roof and fight there , then , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 15]: `` By-the-bye , that 's well thought of , Jack , '' said Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 21]: `` Mesty , up and see if there is any place we can retreat to in case of need . ''
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 35]: Mesty hastened to obey , and soon returned with a report that there was a trap-door leading into the loft under the roof , and that they could draw the ladder up after them .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 12]: `` Then we may laugh at them , '' cried Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 27]: `` Mesty , stay here while I and Gascoigne assist the ladies up , '' explaining to the Rebieras and to their domestics why they went .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 42]: Easy and Gascoigne hastened to the signora and Agnes , conducted them up the ladder into the loft , and requested them to have no fear ; they then returned to the defences on the stairs , and joined their companions .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 35]: They found them hard pressed , and that there was little chance of holding out much longer ; but the stairs were narrow , and the assailants could not bring their force against them .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 40]: But now , as the defences were nearly destroyed , although the convicts could not reach them with their knives , they brought up a large supply of heavy stones , which they threw with great force and execution .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 21]: Two of Don Rebiera 's men and Don Martin were struck down , and this new weapon proved most fatal .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 24]: `` We must retreat , Jack , '' said Gascoigne ; `` the stones can do no harm where we are going to .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 8]: What think you , Don Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 23]: `` I agree with you ; let those who are wounded be first carried up , and then we will follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 80]: This was effected , and as soon as the wounded men were carried up the ladder , and the arms taken up to prevent their falling into the hands of the assailants , for they were now of little use to them , the ammunition being exhausted , the whole body went into the large room which contained the trap-door of the loft , and , as soon as they were up , they drew the ladder after them .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 47]: They had hardly effected this , when they were followed with the yells and shouting of the galley-slaves , who had passed the last barriers , and thought themselves sure of their prey : but they were disappointed -- they found them more secure than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 23]: Nothing could exceed the rage of Don Silvio at the protracted resistance of the party , and the security of their retreat .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 28]: To get at them was impossible , so he determined to set fire to the room , and suffocate them , if he could do no otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 56]: He gave his directions to his men , who rushed down for straw , but in so doing , he carelessly passed under the trap-door , and Mesty , who had carried up with him two or three of the stones , dashed one down on the head of Don Silvio , who fell immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 25]: He was carried away , but his orders were put in execution ; the room was filled with straw and fodder , and lighted .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 37]: The effects were soon felt : the trap-door had been shut , but the heat and smoke burst through ; after a time , the planks and rafters took fire , and their situation was terrible .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 43]: A small trap-window in the roof , on the side of the house , was knocked open , and gave them a temporary relief ; but now the rafters burned and crackled , and the smoke burst on them in thick columns .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 11]: They could not see , and with difficulty could breathe .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 44]: Fortunately the room below that which had been fired was but one out of four on the attics , and , as the loft they were in spread over the whole of the roof , they were able to remove far from it .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 33]: The house was slated with massive slate of some hundred weights each , and it was not found possible to remove them so as to give air although frequent attempts were made .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 68]: Donna Rebiera sank exhausted in the arms of her husband , and Agnes fell into those of our hero , who , enveloped in the smoke , kissed her again and again ; and she , poor girl , thinking that they must all inevitably perish , made no scruple , in what she supposed her last moment , of returning these proofs of her ardent attachment .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 14]: `` Massy Easy , help me here , -- Massa Gascoigne come here .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 17]: Now heab wid all your might : when we get one off we get plenty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 32]: Summoned by Mesty , Jack and Gascoigne put their shoulders to one of the lower slates ; it yielded , was disengaged , and slid down with a loud rattling below .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 33]: The ladies were brought to it , and their heads put outside ; they soon recovered ; and now that they had removed one , they found no difficulty in removing others .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 32]: In a few minutes they were all with their heads in the open air , but still the house was on fire below , and they had no chance of escape .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 63]: It was while they were debating upon that point , and consulting as to their chance of safety , that a breeze of wind wafted the smoke that issued from the roof away from them , and they beheld the detachment of troops making up to the house ; a loud cheer was given , and attracted the notice of the soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 17]: They perceived Easy and his companions ; the house was surrounded and entered in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 34]: The galley-slaves who were in the house , searching for the treasure reported by Don Silvio to be concealed , were captured or killed , and in five minutes the troops had possession .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 10]: But how to assist those above was the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 11]: The room below was in flames , and burning fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 20]: There were no ladders that could reach so high , and there were no means of getting to them .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 17]: The commandant made signs from below , as if to ask what he was to do .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 13]: `` I see no chance , '' observed Don Philip , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 38]: `` Easy , my dear fellow , and you , Gascoigne , I am sorry that the feuds of our family should have brought you to such a dreadful death ; but what can be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 18]: `` I do n't know , '' replied Jack , `` unless we could get ropes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 16]: `` You quite sure , Massy Easy , that all galley rascals below gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 3]: asked Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 28]: `` Yes , '' replied Easy , `` you may see that ; look at some of them bound there , under charge of the soldiers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 15]: `` Den , sar , I tink it high time we go too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 11]: `` So do I , Mesty ; but how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 4]: stop a little .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 30]: Come , help me , Massy Easy ; dis board '' -LRB- for the loft was floored -RRB- `` is loose ; come help , all of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 13]: They all went , and with united strength pulled up the board .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 6]: `` Now strike like hell !
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 15]: -- and drive down de plaster , '' said Mesty , commencing the operation .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 76]: In a few minutes they had beaten an opening into one of the rooms below not on fire , pulled up another board , and Mesty having fetched the ladder , they all descended in safety , and , to the astonishment of the commandant of the troops , walked out of the door of the house , those who had been stunned with the stones having so far recovered as to require little assistance .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 13]: The soldiers shouted as they saw them appear , supporting the females .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 18]: The commanding officer , who was an intimate friend of Don Philip , flew to his arms .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 16]: The prisoners were carefully examined by Mesty , and Don Silvio was not among them .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 23]: He might , however , be among the dead who were left in the house , which now began to burn furiously .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 11]: The galley-slaves who were captured amounted in number to forty-seven .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 7]: Their dead they could not count .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 20]: The major part of the plunder , and the carts , were still where they had been drawn up .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 66]: As soon as the culprits had been secured , the attention of the troops was directed to putting out the flames , but their attempts were ineffectual ; the mansion was burned to the bare walls , and but little of the furniture saved ; indeed , the major part of it had been destroyed in the attack made by Don Silvio and his adherents .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 77]: Leaving directions with Pedro and his people , that the property collected by the miscreants should be restored to the owners , Don Rebiera ordered the horses , and with the whole party put himself under the protection of the troops , who , as soon as they had been refreshed , and taken some repose , bent their way back to Palermo with the galley-slaves , bound and linked together in a long double row .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 14]: They halted when they had gone half-way , and remained for the night .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 41]: The next day at noon , Don Rebiera and his family were once more in their palazzo , and our two midshipmen and Mesty took their leave , and repaired on board to make themselves a little less like chimney-sweepers .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 9]: Captain Wilson was not out of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 36]: Jack made his report , and then went down below , very much pleased at what had passed , especially as he would have another long yarn for the Governor on his return to Malta .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 25]: CHAPTER XXXII In which our hero and Gascoigne ought to be ashamed of themselves , and did feel what might be called midshipmite compunction .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 59]: The Aurora continued three weeks at Palermo , during which the most active search had been made for the remainder of the galley-slaves , and some few had been captured , but still Don Silvio , a considerable number , were at large ; and it was said that they had retired to the fastnesses in the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 34]: Our hero was constantly on shore at Don Rebiera 's house , and , after what had passed , he was now looked upon as soon to become a member of the family .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 52]: The difference of religion was overlooked by Don Rebiera and the relations -- by all but the confessor , Father Thomaso , who now began to agitate and fulminate into the ears of the Donna Rebiera all the pains and penalties attending heretical connection , such as excommunication and utter damnation .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 55]: The effects of his remonstrances were soon visible , and Jack found that there was constraint on the part of the old lady , tears on the part of Agnes , and all father confessors heartily wished at the devil ten times a day , on the part of Don Philip and his brother .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 19]: At last he wormed the truth out of Agnes , who told her tale , and wept bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 28]: `` Ned , I do n't much like the appearance of things , '' observed Jack ; `` I must get rid of that Father Thomaso . ''
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 32]: `` You 'll find that rather difficult , '' observed Gascoigne ; `` besides , if you were rid of him you would have his place filled up with another . ''
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 23]: `` He has frightened that poor old woman into the dismals , and she has the pains of purgatory on her already .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 9]: I shall go and talk to Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 8]: `` How can Mesty help you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 26]: `` I do n't know , but you ca n't ; so , for want of better advice , I 'll try the Ashantee . ''
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 15]: Our hero went to Mesty , and laid the difficult affair open to him .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 20]: `` I see , '' said Mesty , showing his filed teeth , `` you want him skull . ''
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 19]: `` No , I do n't , Mesty ; but I want him out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 8]: `` How that possible , Massy Easy ?
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 7]: -- ship sail day after to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 13]: Now ` pose I ab time , I soon manage all dat .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 5]: Stop a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 4]: `` Confound it !
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 10]: but there 's no stopping , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 19]: `` Suppose , Massy Easy , you get leave go on shore -- not come off again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 9]: `` That will be deserting , Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 19]: `` By holy poker , I ab it -- you go on shore and break your leg . ''
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 5]: `` Break my leg !
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 9]: -- break my leave , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 27]: `` No , Massy Easy -- you break your leg -- den captain leave you shore , and leave me to take care of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 19]: `` But why should I break my leg , and how am I to break my leg ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 9]: `` Only pretend break leg , Massa Easy .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 11]: Go talk Massa Don Philip , he manage all dat .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 19]: Suppose man break his leg in seven pieces , it is not possible to take him board . ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 6]: `` Seven pieces , Mesty !
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 6]: that 's rather too many .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 9]: However , I 'll think of this . ''
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 21]: Jack then went back and consulted Gascoigne , who approved of Mesty 's advice , and thought the scheme feasible .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 48]: `` If we could only pretend that we were thrown out of a caricola , you break your leg , a compound fracture of course , I break my arm -- both left on shore at sick quarters , with Mesty to take care of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 32]: `` Capital , indeed , '' replied Jack ; `` I really would not mind it if it really took place ; at all events we 'll overturn the caricola . ''
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 11]: `` But shall we get leave the last day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 31]: `` Yes , it 's two days since I have been on shore , for I have not liked to go to Don Rebiera 's since what Agnes told me .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 21]: Besides , my clothes are all on shore , and that will be an excuse for a few hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 16]: Our two midshipmen applied for leave the next morning to be off in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 7]: The first lieutenant gave them permission .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 20]: They hastened to the hotel , sent for Don Philip , and made him a party to their plan .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 38]: He readily promised his assistance , for he had resolved that our hero should marry his sister , and was fearful of the effect of his absence , coupled with Friar Thomaso 's influence over his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 16]: He went to the surgeon of his regiment , who immediately entered into the scheme .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 50]: Our two midshipmen got into a caricola , rattled up and down the streets , and perceiving Captain Wilson at his window , flogged the horse into a gallop ; when abreast of the barracks Jack ran the wheel against a bank , and threw himself and Gascoigne out .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 23]: Midshipmen are never hurt by these accidents , but fortunately for the success of the enterprise their faces were cut and bruised .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 53]: Don Philip was standing by : he called the men to pick up our two scamps , carried them into the barracks , and sent for the surgeons , who undressed them , put Jack 's left leg into a multitude of splints , and did the same to Gascoigne 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 63]: They were then put to bed , their contused faces , with the blood , left `` in statu quo , '' while Don Philip sent an orderly , as from the commandant , to Captain Wilson , to acquaint him that two of his officers had been thrown out of a caricola , and were lying dangerously hurt at the barracks .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 14]: `` Good heavens , it must be Mr Easy and Mr Gascoigne ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 24]: said Captain Wilson , when the intelligence was communicated ; `` I saw them galloping down the street like two madmen just now .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 29]: Coxswain , take the gig on board and then tell the surgeon to come on shore immediately , and bring him up to me at the barracks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 23]: Captain Wilson then put on his hat , buckled on his sword , and hastened to ascertain the extent of the injury .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 60]: Don Philip kept out of the way , but the captain was ushered into the room by one of the officers , where he found , in two beds , our two midshipmen stretched out , the surgeon of the forces and the regimental surgeon in consultation between them , while attendants were standing by each bed with restoratives .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 37]: The medical gentlemen saluted Captain Wilson , and looked very grave , talked about fractures , contusions , injuries , in the most interminable manner -- hoped that Mr Easy would recover -- but had doubts .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 31]: The other gentleman might do well with care ; that is , so far as his arm was concerned , but there appeared to be a concussion of the brain .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 50]: Captain Wilson looked at the cut and blood-smeared faces of the two young men , and waited with anxiety the arrival of his own surgeon , who came at last , puffing with the haste he had made , and received the report of the brothers of the faculty .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 22]: The leg of Mr Easy fractured in two places -- had been set -- bone protruding -- impossible to move him .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 14]: Gascoigne , arm , compound fracture -- contusion of the brain not certain .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 57]: Now that all this would have been discovered to be false if the surgeon had been able to examine , is true ; but how could he not credit the surgeon of the forces and the regimental surgeon , and how could he put the young men to fresh tortures by removing splints and unsetting limbs ?
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 37]: Politeness , if nothing else , prevented his so doing , for it would have been as much as to say that either he did not credit their report , or that he doubted their skill .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 44]: He looked at our hero and his companion , who kept their eyes closed , and breathed heavily with their mouths open , put on a grave face , as well as his brothers in the art , and reported to Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 12]: `` But when can they be moved , Mr Daly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 24]: inquired the latter ; `` I can not wait ; we must sail to-morrow , or the next day at the farthest . ''
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 76]: The surgeon , as in duty bound , put the question to the others , who replied that there would be great risk in moving before the fever , which might be expected the next day , and which might last ten days ; but that Captain Wilson had better not think of removing them , as they should have every care and attention where they were , and could rejoin the ship at Malta .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 24]: Mr Daly , the surgeon , agreed that this would be the most prudent step , and Captain Wilson then gave his consent .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 51]: That being settled , he walked up to the bed of Gascoigne , and spoke to him ; but Gascoigne knew that he was to have a concussion of the brain , and he made no reply , nor gave any signs of knowing that Captain Wilson was near him .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 33]: He then went to our hero , who , at the sound of Captain Wilson 's voice , slowly opened his eyes without moving his head , and appeared to recognise him .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 10]: `` Are you in much pain , Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 6]: said the captain , kindly .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 15]: Easy closed his eyes again , and murmured , `` Mesty , Mesty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 18]: `` He wants his servant , the ship 's corporal , sir , '' said the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 27]: `` Well , '' replied Captain Wilson , `` he had better have him : he is a faithful fellow , and will nurse him well .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 35]: When you go on board , Mr Daly , desire the first lieutenant to send Mesty on shore with Mr Gascoigne 's and Mr Easy 's chests , and his own bag and hammock .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 3]: Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 13]: I would not for a thousand pounds that this accident had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 24]: Poor foolish boys -- they run in couples , and if one 's in a scrape the other is sure to share it .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 24]: Gentlemen , I return you many thanks for your kindness , and I must accept of your promised care for my unfortunate officers .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 6]: I sail to-morrow at daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 31]: You will oblige me by informing their friends , the Rebieras , of their mischance , as I am sure they will contribute all they can to their comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 16]: So saying , Captain Wilson bowed and quitted the room , followed by the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 38]: As soon as the door was closed the two midshipmen turned their heads round and looked at each other , but they were afraid to speak at first , in case of the return of the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 87]: As soon as it was announced to them that Captain Wilson and Mr Daly were outside the barrack-gate , our hero commenced -- `` Do you know , Ned , that my conscience smites me , and if it had not been that I should have betrayed those who wish to oblige us , when poor Captain Wilson appeared so much hurt and annoyed at our accident , I was very near getting up and telling him of the imposition , to relieve his mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 24]: `` I agree with you , Jack , and I felt much the same -- but what 's done can not be undone .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 23]: We must now keep up the imposition for the sake of those who , to help us , have deceived him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 22]: `` I do n't think that you would find an English surgeon who would have consented to such an imposition . ''
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 21]: `` No , that is certain ; but after all , it is an imposition that has hurt nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 36]: `` Oh , I do not wish to moralise -- but I repent of my share in the deceit ; and had it to be done over again I would not consent to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 6]: `` Not even for -- ?
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 11]: but I wo n't mention her name in barracks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 29]: `` I do n't know , '' replied Jack ; `` but let 's say no more about it , and thank these gentlemen for their kindness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 19]: `` Yes , but we must keep it up until we see the Aurora under all sail . ''
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 22]: `` And longer too , '' replied Jack ; `` we must not let the affair get wind even on shore .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 12]: We must not recover quickly , but still appear to recover .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 9]: Don Rebiera and his wife must be deceived .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 22]: I have a plot in my head , but I can not work it out clear till I see Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 6]: Don Philip now came in .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 27]: He had seen Captain Wilson , who had requested him to look after the two invalids , and stated his intention to sail the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 61]: They consulted with him , and it was agreed that no one should be acquainted with the real fact but his brother Martin , and that all Palermo should be as much deceived as Captain Wilson , for if not , it would put Father Thomaso on the `` qui vive , '' and make him fulminate more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 36]: Our midshipmen ate an excellent dinner , and then remained in bed conversing till it was time to go to sleep ; but long before that , Mesty had made his appearance with their clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 36]: The eyes of the Ashantee said all that was necessary -- he never spoke a word , but unlashed his hammock and lay down in a corner , and they were soon all three asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 32]: The next morning Captain Wilson called to ascertain how our hero and his companion were , but the room had been darkened , and he could not see their faces plainly .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 57]: Easy thanked him for his kindness in allowing Mesty to attend them , and having received his orders as to their joining the ship as soon as they recovered , and having promised to be very cautious in their behaviour and keep out of all scrapes , he wished them a speedy recovery , and departed .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 29]: In little more than half an hour afterwards , Mesty , who had been peeping out of the shutters , suddenly threw them open with a loud laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 18]: The Aurora was under way , with studding sails below and aloft standing out of the roads .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 18]: Jack and Gascoigne got up , threw off the splints , and danced about in their shirts .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 27]: As soon as they were quiet again , Mesty said in a grave tone , `` Den why you stay at sea , Massa Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 26]: `` Very true , Mesty , I 've asked myself that question often enough lately ; because I 'm a fool , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 34]: `` And I , because I ca n't help it , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` never mind , we are on shore now , and I look for a famous cruise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 39]: `` But first we must see what the ground is we are to cruise on , '' replied Jack ; `` so , Mesty , let us have a palaver , as they say in your country . ''
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 24]: The two midshipmen got into their beds , and Mesty sat on the chest between them , looking as grave as a judge .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 13]: The question was , how to get rid of the padre Thomaso .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 46]: Was he to be thrown over the mole-head to the fishes -- or his skull broke -- was Mesty 's knife to be resorted to -- was he to be kidnapped or poisoned -- or were fair means to be employed -- persuasion , bribery ?
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 14]: Every one knows how difficult it is to get rid of a priest .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 75]: As our hero and Gascoigne were not Italians , they thought that bribery would be the more English-like way of doing the thing ; so they composed a letter , to be delivered by Mesty to the friar , in which Jack offered to Father Thomaso the moderate sum of one thousand dollars , provided he would allow the marriage to proceed , and not frighten the old lady with ecclesiastical squibs and crackers .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 93]: As Mesty was often on shore with Jack , and knew the friar very well by sight , it was agreed that the letter should be confided to his charge ; but as it was not consistent that a person in such a state as our hero was represented to be should sit up and write letters , the delivery was deferred for a few days , when after waiting that time , Mesty delivered the letter to the friar , and made signs that he was to take back the answer .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 31]: The friar beckoned him that he was to accompany him to his room , where he read the letter , and then again made signs to him to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 31]: The friar led the way to his monastery , and as soon as Mesty was in his cell , he summoned another who could speak English to act as interpreter .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 7]: `` Is your master recovering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' replied Mesty , `` he is at present doing well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 8]: `` Have you served him long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 7]: `` No , '' replied Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 8]: `` Are you very fond of him ?
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 13]: does he treat you well , give you plenty of money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 33]: At these questions , the artful black conceived that there was something in the wind , and he therefore very quietly replied , `` I do not care much for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 35]: The friar fixed his keen eye upon Mesty , and perceived there was a savage look about the black , from which he augured that he was a man who would suit his purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 20]: `` Your master offers me a thousand dollars ; would you wish to gain this money for yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 9]: Mesty grinned , and showed his sharp-filed teeth .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 14]: `` It would make me a rich man in my own country . ''
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 29]: `` It would , '' replied the friar ; `` now , you shall have it , if you will only give your master a small powder . ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 17]: `` I understand , '' replied Mesty ; `` hab those things in my country . ''
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 7]: `` Well -- do you consent ?
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 15]: -- if so , I will write the letter to get the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 8]: `` Suppose they find me out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 3]: replied Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 24]: `` You will be safe , and you shall be sent away as soon as possible -- say , will you consent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 7]: `` The whole thousand dollars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 7]: `` Every one of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 8]: `` Den give me the powder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 42]: `` Stay a little '' , replied the friar , who went out of the cell , and , in about ten minutes , returned with an answer to our hero 's letter , and a paper containing a greyish powder .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 30]: `` Give him this in his soup or anything -- spread it on his meat , or mix it up with his sugar if he eats an orange . ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 8]: `` I see , '' replied Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 16]: `` The dollars shall be yours , I swear it on the holy cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 19]: Mesty grinned horribly , took his credentials , and then asked , `` When I come again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 43]: `` As soon as you have received the money bring it to me at Don Rebiera 's -- then give the powder : as soon as it is given you must let me know , for you must not remain in Palermo .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 12]: I will myself conduct you to a place of safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 14]: Mesty then quitted the cell , and was shown out of the monastery .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 14]: `` By de holy poker , he one d -- n rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 12]: muttered Mesty , as he was once in the open air .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 7]: `` But stop a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 21]: The Ashantee soon arrived at the barracks , and repeated the whole of the conference between him and Friar Thomaso .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 23]: `` It must be poison , of course , '' observed Gascoigne ; `` suppose we try it upon some animal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 18]: `` No , Massa Gascoigne , '' replied Mesty , `` I try it myself , by-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 6]: Now what we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 18]: `` I must give you the order for the thousand dollars , Mesty , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 55]: `` The rascal here writes to me that for that sum , he will consent not only not to oppose me , but agrees to assist my cause ; but the great question is , whether he will keep his word with you , Mesty ; if not , I shall lose my money .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 15]: So therefore we must now have another palaver , and argue the point . ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 9]: The point was argued between Jack and Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 16]: A thousand dollars was a large sum , but Jack 's father was a philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 49]: After many pros and cons , it was at last decided that the money should be given to Mesty ; but Mesty should state , when he took the money to the friar , that he had administered the powder , and claim it when he presented it .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 23]: The next day , the order for the money was given to Mesty , and he went to Friar Thomaso with it .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 15]: The friar hastened with Mesty to the monastery , and sent for the interpreter .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 7]: `` You have given it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 4]: inquired the friar .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 8]: `` Yes -- not one hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 8]: Here de order for de money . ''
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 20]: `` You must run for the money before he is dead , for the powder is very rapid . ''
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 20]: `` And me , '' replied Mesty , apparently much alarmed , `` where am I to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 18]: `` As soon as you bring the money here , you must go back to the barracks .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 12]: Remain there till he is dead , and then return here .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 61]: I will have all ready , and take you , as soon as it is dusk , to a monastery of our order in the mountains , where no one will think of looking for you , till the affair is blown over ; and then I will find you a passage in some vessel out of the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 36]: Mesty hastened for the money , and taking it in a large bag to the monastery , delivered it to the friar 's charge , and then returned to the barracks to Easy and Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 27]: It was agreed that he should go with the friar , who would probably remain away some time ; indeed , Mesty insisted upon so doing .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 22]: Mesty stayed two hours , and then returned about dusk to the monastery , and reported the death of our hero .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 24]: He remained there until it was dark , and then the friar ordered him to tie the bag of dollars to his saddle-bow .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 14]: They mounted two mules , which stood already caparisoned , and quitted Palermo .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 36]: In the morning Don Philip , as usual , made his appearance , and told our hero that the friar had been summoned away by the abbot , and would not return for some time .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 32]: `` I came to tell you this news , '' said Don Philip , `` as I thought it would please you ; the sooner you are now well the better .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 29]: I mean to propose your being both removed to my father 's palazzo , and then you can recover your lost ground during the confessor 's absence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 17]: `` And I have the means , '' replied Jack , showing the friar 's letter .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 21]: Don Philip read it with astonishment , but was still more surprised when he heard the whole story from Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 23]: He was for a time silent : at last he said , -- `` I am sorry for your poor black . ''
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 5]: `` Why so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 3]: replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 12]: `` You will never see him again , depend upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 35]: A thousand dollars would sign the death warrant of a thousand blacks ; but there is another reason -- they will put him out of the way , that he may not give evidence .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 6]: Where is the powder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 13]: `` Mesty has it ; he would not part with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 24]: `` He is a shrewd fellow , that black ; he may be too much for the friar , '' replied Don Philip .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 13]: `` He means mischief , I 'm sure , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 29]: `` Still I feel a great deal of alarm about him , '' replied Easy ; `` I wish now that I had not let him go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 9]: `` Are you sure that he went ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 28]: `` No , I am not ; but the friar told him that he should take him to the mountains as soon as it was dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 22]: `` And probably he will , '' replied Don Philip , `` as the best place to get rid of him .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 42]: However , the whole of this story must be told both to my father and my mother ; to the former , that he may take the right measures , and to my mother , that it may open her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 22]: Give me the copy of the letter you wrote to the friar , and then I shall have it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 21]: The report of the accident which had occurred to Easy and Gascoigne had been spread and fully believed throughout Palermo .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 18]: Indeed , as usual , it had been magnified , and asserted that they could not recover .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 33]: To Agnes only had the case been imparted in confidence by Don Philip , for her distress at the first intelligence had been so great that her brother could not conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 60]: Two days after Don Philip had made his parents acquainted with the villainy of the friar , the midshipmen were transported to the palazzo , much to the surprise of everybody , and much to the renown of the surgeons , who were indemnified for their duplicity and falsehood by an amazing extension of their credit as skilful men .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 22]: After their arrival at the palazzo , Don Rebiera was also entrusted with the secret , but it went no farther .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 67]: As now there was no particular hurry for our hero to get well , he was contented and happy in the society of Agnes and her parents ; the old lady , after she had been informed of the conduct of Friar Thomaso , having turned round in our hero 's favour , and made a vow never to have a confessor in the house again .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 26]: Jack and Gascoigne were now as happy as could be ; all their alarm was about Mesty , for whose return they were most anxious .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 15]: To Don Rebiera , Jack made known formally his intentions with regard to Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 27]: He fully satisfied him as to his qualifications and his property , and Don Rebiera was fully aware of his debt of gratitude to our hero .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 28]: But all he required was the consent of Jack 's father , and until this was obtained , he would not consent to the marriage taking place .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 32]: Jack attempted to argue the point ; his father , he said , had married without consulting him , and therefore he had a right to marry without consulting his father .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 49]: But Don Rebiera , not having any acquaintance with the rights of man and equality , did not feel the full force of Jack 's argument , and made it a sine qua non that his parents should write and consent to the alliance before it took place .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 26]: CHAPTER XXXIII In which Mesty should be called throughout Mephistopheles , for it abounds in black cloaks , disguises , daggers , and dark deeds .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 43]: On the fourth evening after the removal of our two midshipmen to the palazzo of Don Rebiera , as they were sitting in company with Agnes and Don Philip in their own room , a friar made his appearance at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 22]: They all started , for by his height they imagined him to be Friar Thomaso , but no one addressed him .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 31]: The friar shut the door without saying a word , and then lifting up his cowl , which had been drawn over it , discovered the black face of Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 16]: Agnes screamed , and all sprang from their seats at this unusual and unexpected apparition .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 19]: Mesty grinned , and there was that in his countenance which said that he had much to communicate .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 9]: `` Where is the friar -- Mesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 3]: inquired Easy .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 20]: `` Stop a little , Massa -- suppose we lock door first , and den I tell all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 29]: Taking this precaution , Mesty threw off the friar 's gown , and appeared in his own dress , with the bag of dollars slung round his body .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 25]: `` Now , Massa Easy , I hab a long story to tell -- so I tink I better begin at the beginning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 37]: `` It is the most approved method , '' replied Jack , `` but stop when I hold up my finger , that we may translate what you say to the lady and Don Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 7]: `` Dat all right , sar .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 14]: Friar and I get on two mule as soon as it quite dark .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 15]: He make me carry all tousand dollars -- and we ride out of town .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 48]: We go up mountain and mountain , but the moon get up shine and we go on cheek by jowl -- he nebber say one word , and I nebber say one word , 'cause I no speak his lingo , and he no understand my English .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 46]: About two o'clock in de morning , we stop at a house and stay dere till eight o'clock , and den we go on again all next day , up all mountain , only stop once , eat a bit bread and drink lilly wine .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 28]: Second night come on , and den we stop again , and people bow very low to him , and woman bring in rabbit for make supper .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 63]: I go in the kitchen , woman make stew smell very nice , so I nod my head , and I say very good , and she make a face , and throw on table black loaf of bread and garlic , and make sign dat for my supper ; good enough for black fellow , and dat rabbit stew for friar .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 27]: Den I say to myself , stop a little ; suppose friar hab all de rabbit , I tink I give him a lilly powder . ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 7]: `` The powder , Mesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 3]: exclaimed Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 7]: `` What does he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 4]: inquired Don Philip .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 8]: Gascoigne translated all that Mesty had communicated .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 9]: The interest of the narrative now became exciting .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 52]: Mesty continued : -- `` Well , Massa Easy , den woman she go for dish to put stew in , and I take de powder and drop it in de pot , and den I sit down again and eat black bread , she say good enough for black man .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 23]: She tir up de stew once more , and den she pour it out into dish , and take it to friar .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 30]: He lick um chops , by all de powers , and he like um so well he pick all de bones , and wipe up gravy with him bread .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 17]: You tink it very nice , Massa Friar , tink I ; but stop a little .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 38]: After he drink a whole bottle of wine , he tell me bring mules to de door , and he put him hands on de woman head , and dat de way he pay for him supper .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 42]: `` The moon shone bright , and we go up all mountain , always go up , and ` bout two hour , he get off him mule and he put him hand so , and set down on de rock .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 37]: He twist , and he turn , and he groan , for half an hour , and den he look at me , as much as to say , you black villain , you do this ?
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 45]: for he not able to speak , and den I pull out de paper of de powder , and I show him , and make him sign he swallow it : he look again , and I laugh at him and he die . ''
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 28]: `` Oh , Mesty , Mesty , '' exclaimed our hero ; `` you should not have done that , there will mischief come from it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 14]: `` Now he dead , Massa Easy , so much less mischief . ''
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 22]: Gascoigne then interpreted to Don Philip and Agnes , the former of whom looked very grave , and the latter terrified .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 26]: `` Let him go on , '' said Don Philip ; `` I am most anxious to hear what he did with the body . ''
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 83]: Mesty , at the request of our hero , proceeded : `` Den I thought what I should do , and I said I would hide him , and I tink I take his coat for myself , so I pull off him coat and I pull off all his oder clothes -- he not wear many -- and I take the body in my arm , and carry him where I find a great split in de rock above all road .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 64]: I throw him in , and den I throw plenty large pieces rock on him till I no see him any more ; den I take de two mules and get on mine wid de dollars , and lead de other three four mile , till I come to a large wood -- take off him saddle and bridle , turn him adrift .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 29]: Den I tear up all clothes all in lilly bits , hide one piece here , noder piece dere , and de saddle and bridle in de bush .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 53]: All right , now , I say so I put on friar cloak , hide my face , get on my mule , and den I look where I shall go -- so I say , I not be in dis road anyhow , I pass through wood till I find nother .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 50]: I go ` bout two mile -- moon go down , all dark , and five six men catch hold my bridle , and they all got arms , so I do noting -- they speak to me , but I no answer , and nebber show my face .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 22]: They find all dollars -LRB- d -- n um -RRB- fast enough , and they lead me away through the wood .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 23]: Last we come to a large fire in de wood , plenty of men lie about , some eat and some drink .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 21]: They pull me off , and I hold down my head and fold my arms , just like friar do .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 17]: They bring me along to one man , and pour out all my dollar before him .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 35]: He give some order , and they take me away , and I peep through the cloak , and I say to myself , he that d -- n galley-slave rascal Don Silvio . ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 5]: `` Don Silvio ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 3]: cried Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 10]: `` What does he say of Don Silvio ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 4]: demanded Don Philip .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 11]: Mesty 's narrative was again translated , and he continued .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 76]: `` Dey led me away about fifty yards , tie me to tree , and den they leave me , and dey all drink and make merry , nebber offer me anything , so , I hab noting den to eat ; I eat de ropes and gnaw them through and den I stay there two hour until all go asleep , and all quiet ; for I say to myself , stop a little .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 59]: Den when dey all fast asleep , I take out my knife and I crawl ` long de ground , as we do in our country sometime -- and den I stop and look ` bout me ; no man watch but two , and dey look out for squarl , not look in board where I was .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 16]: I crawl again till I lay down alongside that d -- n galley-slave Don Silvio .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 13]: He lie fast asleep with my bag thousand dollars under him head .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 14]: So I tink , ` you not hab dem long , you rascal .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 87]: I look round -- all right , and I drive my knife good aim into him heart and press toder hand on him mouth , but he make no noise ; he struggle little and look up , and den I throw off de head of de gown and show him my black face , and he look and he try to speak ; but I stop dat , for down go my knife again , and de d -- n galley-slave dead as herring . ''
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 17]: `` Stop , Mesty , we must tell this to Don Philip , '' said Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 3]: `` Dead !
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 4]: Don Silvio dead !
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 24]: well , Mesty , we are eternally obliged to you , for there was no safety for my father while he was living .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 6]: Let him go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 64]: `` So when I put de knife through his body , I lie down by him as if noting had happened , for ten minutes , and den I take de bag of dollars from under him head , and den I feel him all over , and I find him pistols and him purse , which I hab here , all gold .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 19]: So I take them and I look -- all asleep , and I crawl back to de tree .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 30]: Den I stay to tink a little ; de man on watch come up and look at me , but he tink all right and he go away again .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 14]: Lucky ting , by de power , dat I go back to tree .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 69]: I wait again , and den I crawl and crawl till I clear of all , and den I take to my heel and run for um life , till daylight come , and den I so tired I lie down in bush ; I stay in bush all day , and den I set off again back here , for I find road and know my way .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 26]: I not eat den for one day and one night , and come to house where I put my head in and find woman there .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 17]: I not able to speak , so I help myself , and not show my face .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 32]: She not like dat and make a bobbery , but I lift up my cloak and show my black face and white teeth , and den she tink me de debil .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 24]: She run out of de house and I help myself very quick , and den set off and come close here yesterday morning .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 50]: I hide myself all day and come in at night , and now , Massa Easy , you ab haf de whole truth and you ab your tousand dollars -- and you ab got rid of de rascal friar and de d -- n galley-slave , Don Silvio . ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 24]: `` Tell them all this , Ned , '' said Jack , who , whilst Gascoigne was so employed , talked with Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 45]: `` I was very much frightened for you , Mesty , '' said Jack ; `` but still I thought you quite as cunning as the friar , and so it has turned out ; but the thousand dollars ought to be yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 33]: `` No , sar , '' replied Mesty , `` the dollars not mine ; but I hab plenty of gold in Don Silvio 's purse -- plenty , plenty of gold .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 14]: I keep my property , Massa Easy , and you keep yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 52]: `` I 'm afraid that this affair may be found out , Mesty ; the woman will spread the report of having been attacked by a black friar , and that will lead to suspicion , as the other friars of the convent knew that you left with Friar Thomaso . ''
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 19]: `` So I tink dat , but when a man starve , he quite forget his thought . ''
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 17]: `` I do n't blame you ; but now I must talk to Don Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 34]: `` Suppose you no objection , while you talk I eat something from the table then , Massa Easy , for I hungry enough to eat de friar , mule and all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 16]: `` Eat , my good fellow , and drink as much as you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 33]: The consultation between our two midshipmen and Don Philip was not long : they perceived the immediate necessity for the departure of Mesty , and the suspicion which would attach to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 28]: Don Philip and Agnes left them , to go to Don Rebiera , and make him acquainted with what had passed , and to ask his advice .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 14]: When they went into the room , Don Rebiera immediately accosted his son .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 15]: `` Have you heard , Philip , that Friar Thomaso has returned at last ?
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 8]: -- so the servants tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 23]: `` The report may be fortunate , '' replied Don Philip ; `` but I have another story to tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 15]: He then sat down and imparted to Don Rebiera all the adventures of Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 49]: Don Rebiera was for some time in deep thought ; at last he replied , -- `` That Don Silvio is no more is fortunate , and the negro would be entitled to reward for his destruction -- but for the friar , that is a bad business .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 31]: The negro might remain and tell the whole story , and the facts might be proved by the evidence of Signor Easy , and the letters ; but what then ?
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 44]: we should raise the whole host of the clergy against our house , and we have suffered too much from them already ; the best plan would be the immediate departure , not only of the negro but of our two young friends .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 29]: The supposition of Friar Thomaso being here , and their departure with the negro servant to rejoin their ship , will remove much suspicion and destroy all inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 6]: They must be off immediately .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 49]: Go to them , Philip , and point out to them the absolute necessity of this measure , and tell our young friend that I rigidly adhere to my promise , and as soon as he has his father 's sanction I will bestow upon him my daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 19]: In the meantime I will send down and see if a vessel can be chartered for Malta . ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 146]: Our hero and Gascoigne fully admitted the wisdom of this measure , and prepared for their departure ; indeed , now that Don Rebiera 's resolution had been made known to our hero , he cared more for obtaining his father 's consent than he did for remaining to enjoy himself at Palermo ; and before noon of the next day all was ready , the vessel had been procured , Jack took his leave of Agnes and her mother , and , accompanied by Don Rebiera and Don Phillip -LRB- for Don Martin was on duty a few miles from Palermo -RRB- , went down to the beach , and , having bid them farewell , embarked with Gascoigne and Mesty on board of the two-masted lateen which had been engaged , and before sunset not a steeple of Palermo was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 10]: `` What are you thinking of , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 13]: said Gascoigne , after our hero had been silent half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 17]: `` I have been thinking , Ned , that we are well out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 18]: `` So do I , '' replied Gascoigne ; and here the conversation dropped for a time .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 11]: `` What are you thinking of now , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 8]: said Gascoigne , after a long pause .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 17]: `` I 've been thinking that I 've a good story for the old Governor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 17]: `` Very true , '' replied Gascoigne ; and both were again silent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 11]: `` What are you thinking of now , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 8]: said Gascoigne , after another long interval .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 16]: `` I 've been thinking that I shall leave the service , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 27]: `` I wish you would take me with you , '' replied Gascoigne , with a sigh ; and again they were both in deep contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 11]: `` What are you thinking of now , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 4]: said Gascoigne again .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 9]: `` Of Agnes , '' replied our hero .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 18]: `` Well , if that 's the case , I 'll call you when supper 's ready .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 12]: In the meantime I 'll go and talk with Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 23]: CHAPTER XXXIV Jack leaves the service , in which he had no business , and goes home to mind his own business .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 34]: On the fourth day they arrived at Malta , and our two midshipmen , as soon as they had settled with the padrone of the vessel , went up to the government house .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 19]: They found the Governor in the veranda , who held out both his hands , one to each .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 9]: `` Glad to see you , my lads .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 12]: Well , Jack , how 's the leg -- all right ?
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 4]: do n't limp ?
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 7]: And your arm , Gascoigne ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 19]: `` All right , sir , and as sound as ever it was , '' replied they both .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 43]: `` Then you 're in luck , and have made more haste than you deserve , after your mad pranks : but now sit down , and I suppose , my friend Jack , you have a story to tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 14]: `` O yes , Sir Thomas , and a very long one . ''
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 23]: `` Then I wo n't have it now , for I expect people on business ; we 'll have it after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 11]: Get your things up and take possession of your rooms .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 7]: The Aurora sailed four days ago .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 8]: You 've had a wonderful recovery . ''
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 6]: `` Wonderful , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 12]: replied our hero ; `` all Palermo rings with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 14]: `` Well you may go now -- I shall see you at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 34]: Wilson will be delighted when he hears that you have got round again , for he was low-spirited about it , I can tell you , which is more than you deserve . ''
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 18]: `` He 's right there , '' said our hero to Gascoigne , as they walked away .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 89]: When dinner was over , Jack narrated to the Governor the adventures of Mesty , with which he was much interested ; but when they were quite alone in the evening , the Governor called our two midshipmen into the veranda , and said : `` Now my lads , I 'm not going to preach , as the saying is , but I 've been long enough in the world to know that a compound fracture of the leg is not cured in fourteen or sixteen days .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 9]: I ask you to tell me the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 11]: Did not you deceive Captain Wilson on this point ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 16]: `` I am ashamed to say that we did , sir , '' replied Easy .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 11]: `` How did you manage that , and why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 27]: Jack then went into further details relative to himself and his amour , stating his wish to be left behind , and all that had passed .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 16]: `` Well , there 's some excuse for you , but none for the surgeons .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 23]: If any surgeon here had played such a trick , I would have hung him , as sure as I 'm Governor .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 8]: This affair of yours has become serious .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 15]: Mr Easy , we must have some conversation on the matter to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 15]: The next morning the packet from England was reported off the harbour 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 17]: After breakfast the letters were brought on shore , and the Governor sent for our hero .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 21]: `` Mr Easy , here are two letters for you ; I am sorry to say , with black seals .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 19]: I trust that they do not bring the intelligence of the death of any very near relative . ''
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 15]: Jack bowed without speaking , took the letters , and went to his room .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 9]: The first he opened was from his father .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 91]: `` MY DEAR JOHN , `` You will be much grieved to hear that your poor mother , after sitting in the corner for nearly two years waiting for the millennium , appeared to pine away ; whether from disappointment or not I do not know ; but at last , in spite of all Dr Middleton could do , she departed this life ; and , as the millennium would not come to her as she expected , it is to be hoped she is gone to the millennium .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 16]: She was a good wife , and I always let her have her own way .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 63]: Dr Middleton does not appear to be satisfied as to the cause of her death , and has wished to examine ; but I said no , for I am a philosopher , and it is no use looking for causes after effects ; but I have done since her death what she never would permit me to do during her life .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 29]: I have had her head shaved , and examined it very carefully as a phrenologist , and most curiously has she proved the truth of the sublime science .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 7]: I will give you the result .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 57]: Determination , very prominent ; Benevolence , small ; Caution , extreme ; Veneration , not very great ; Philoprogenitiveness , strange to say , is very large , considering she has but one child ; Imagination , very strong : you know , my dear boy , she was always imagining some nonsense or another .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 7]: Her other organs were all moderate .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 4]: Poor dear creature !
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 21]: she is gone , and we may well wail , for a better mother or a better wife never existed .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 25]: And now , my dear boy , I must request that you call for your discharge , and come home as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 21]: I can not exist without you , and I require your assistance in the grand work I have in contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 68]: The time is at hand , the cause of equality will soon triumph ; the abject slaves now hold up their heads ; I have electrified them with my speeches , but I am getting old and feeble ; I require my son to leave my mantle to , as one prophet did to another , and then I will , like him , ascend in glory .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 10]: `` Your affectionate Father , `` NICODEMUS EASY '' .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 22]: From this it would appear , thought Jack , that my mother is dead , and that my father is mad .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 55]: For some time our hero remained in a melancholy mood ; he dropped many tears to the memory of his mother , whom , if he had never respected , he had much loved : and it was not till half an hour had elapsed , that he thought of opening the other letter .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 6]: It was from Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 41]: `` MY DEAR BOY , `` Although not a correspondent of yours , I take the right of having watched you through all your childhood , and from a knowledge of your disposition , to write you a few lines .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 22]: That you have , by this time , discarded your father 's foolish , nonsensical philosophy , I am very sure .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 48]: It was I who advised your going away for that purpose , and I am sure , that , as a young man of sense , and the heir to a large property , you will before this have seen the fallacy of your father 's doctrines .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 33]: Your father tells me that he has requested you to come home , and allow me to add any weight I may have with you in persuading you to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 37]: It is fortunate for you that the estate is entailed , or you might soon be a beggar , for there is no saying what debts he might , in his madness , be guilty of .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 35]: He has already been dismissed from the magistracy by the lord-lieutenant , in consequence of his haranguing the discontented peasantry , and I may say , exciting them to acts of violence and insubordination .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 15]: He has been seen dancing and hurrahing round a stack fired by an incendiary .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 17]: He has turned away his keepers , and allowed all poachers to go over the manor .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 47]: In short , he is not in his senses ; and , although I am far from advising coercive measures , I do consider that it is absolutely necessary that you should immediately return home , and look after what will one day be your property .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 16]: You have no occasion to follow the profession , with eight thousand pounds per annum .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 17]: You have distinguished yourself , now make room for those who require it for their subsistence .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 4]: God bless you .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 10]: I shall soon hope to shake hands with you .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 10]: `` Yours most truly , `` G. MIDDLETON . ''
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 26]: There was matter for deep reflection in these two letters , and Jack never felt before how much his father had been in the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 65]: That he had gradually been weaned from his ideas was true , but still he had , to a certain degree , clung to them , as we do to a habit ; but now he felt that his eyes were opened ; the silly , almost unfeeling letter of his father upon the occasion of his mother 's death , opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 28]: For a long while Jack was in a melancholy meditation , and then casting his eyes upon his watch , he perceived that it was almost dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 21]: That he could eat his dinner was certain , and he scorned to pretend to feel what he did not .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 19]: He therefore dressed himself and went down , grave , it is true , but not in tears .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 32]: He spoke little at dinner , and retired as soon as it was over , presenting his two letters to the Governor , and asking his advice for the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 44]: Gascoigne followed him , and to him he confided his trouble ; and Ned , finding that Jack was very low-spirited , consoled him to the best of his power , and brought a bottle of wine which he procured from the butler .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 38]: Before they returned to bed , Jack had given his ideas to his friend , which were approved of , and wishing him a good-night , he threw himself into bed , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 45]: `` One thing is certain , my good fellow , '' observed the Governor to our hero , as he gave him back his letters at the breakfast table the next morning ; `` that your father is as mad as a March hare .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 21]: I agree with that doctor , who appears a sensible man , that you had better go home immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 10]: `` And leave the service altogether , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 3]: replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 18]: `` Why , I must say , that I do not think you exactly fitted for it .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 78]: I shall be sorry to lose you , as you have a wonderful talent for adventure , and I shall have no more yams to hear when you return ; but , if I understand right from Captain Wilson , you were brought into the profession because he thought that the service might be of use in eradicating false notions , rather than from any intention or necessity of your following it up as a profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 31]: `` I suspect that was the case , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` as , for my own part , I hardly know why I entered it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 65]: `` To find a mare 's nest , my lad ; I 've heard all about it ; but never mind that : the question is now about your leaving it , to look after your own property , and I think I may venture to say , that I can arrange all that matter at once , without referring to Admiral or captain .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 24]: I will be responsible for you , and you may go home in the packet , which sails on Wednesday for England . ''
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 18]: `` Thank you , Sir Thomas , I am much obliged to you , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 24]: `` You , Mr Gascoigne , I shall , of course , send out by the first opportunity to rejoin your ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 22]: `` Thank you , Sir Thomas , I am much obliged to you , '' replied Gascoigne , making a bow .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 39]: `` You 'll break no more arms , if you please , sir , '' continued the Governor ; `` a man in love may have some excuse in breaking his leg , but you had none . ''
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 38]: `` I beg your pardon , sir ; if Mr Easy was warranted in breaking his leg out of love , I submit that I could do no less than break my arm out of friendship . ''
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 26]: `` Hold your tongue , sir , or I 'll break your head from the very opposite feeling , '' replied the Governor , good-humouredly .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 41]: `` But observe , young man , I shall keep this affair secret , as in honour bound ; but let me advise you , as you have only your profession to look to , to follow it up steadily .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 12]: It is high time that you and Mr Easy were separated .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 12]: He is independent of the service , and you are not .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 19]: A young man possessing such ample means will never be fitted for the duties of a junior officer .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 33]: He can do no good for himself , and is certain to do much harm to others : a continuance of his friendship would probably end in your ruin , Mr Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 40]: You must be aware , that if the greatest indulgence had not been shown to Mr Easy by his captain and first lieutenant , he never could have remained in the service so long as he has done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 22]: As the Governor made the last remark in rather a severe tone , our two midshipmen were silent for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 28]: At last Jack observed , very quietly , -- `` And yet , sir , I think , considering all , I have behaved pretty well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 30]: `` You have behaved very well , my good lad , on all occasions in which your courage and conduct , as an officer , have been called forth .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 42]: I admit it ; and had you been sent to sea with a mind properly regulated , and without such an unlimited command of money , I have no doubt but that you would have proved an ornament to the service .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 44]: Even now I think you would , if you were to remain in the service under proper guidance and necessary restrictions , for you have , at least , learnt to obey , which is absolutely necessary before you are fit to command .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 25]: But recollect , what your conduct would have brought upon you , if you had not been under the parental care of Captain Wilson .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 44]: But let us say no more about that : a midshipman with the prospect of eight thousand pounds a year is an anomaly which the service can not admit , especially when that midshipman is resolved to take to himself a wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 13]: `` I hope that you approve of that step , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 35]: `` That entirely depends upon the merit of the party , which I know nothing of , except that she has a pretty face , and is of one of the best Sicilian families .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 12]: I think the difference of religion a ground of objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 13]: `` We will argue that point , sir , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 41]: `` Perhaps it will be the cause of more argument than you think for , Mr Easy ; but every man makes his own bed , and as he makes it , so must he lie down in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 11]: `` What am I to do about Mesty , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 12]: I can not bear the idea of parting with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 16]: `` I am afraid that you must ; I can not well interfere there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 58]: `` He is of little use to the service , sir ; he has been sent to sick quarters as my servant : if he may be permitted to go home with me , I will procure his discharge as soon as I arrive , and send him on board the guard-ship till I obtain it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 43]: `` I think that , on the whole , he is as well out of the service as in it , and therefore I will , on consideration , take upon myself the responsibility , provided you do as you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 28]: The conversation was here ended , as the Governor had business to attend to , and Jack and Gascoigne went to their rooms to make their arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 20]: `` The Governor is right , '' observed Gascoigne ; `` it is better that we part , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 33]: You have half unfitted me for the service already ; I have a disgust of the midshipmen 's berth ; the very smell of pitch and tar has become odious to me .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 26]: This is all wrong ; I must forget you and all our pleasant cruises on shore , and once more swelter in my greasy Jacket .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 37]: When I think that , if our pretended accidents were discovered , I should be dismissed the service , and the misery which that would cause to my poor father , I tremble at my escape .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 21]: The Governor is right , Jack ; we must part , but I hope you never will forget me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 8]: `` My hand upon it , Ned .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 49]: Command my interest , if ever I have any -- my money -- what I have , and the house , whether it belongs to me or my father -- as far as you are concerned at least , I adhere to my notions of perfect equality . ''
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 16]: `` And abjure them , I trust , Jack , as a universal principle . ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 21]: `` I admit , as the Governor asserts , that my father is as mad as a March hare . ''
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 21]: `` That is sufficient ; you do n't know how glad it makes me to hear you say that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 14]: The two friends were inseparable during the short time that they remained together .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 26]: They talked over their future prospects , their hopes and anticipations , and when the conversation flagged , Gascoigne brought up the name of Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 17]: Mesty 's delight at leaving the service , and going home with his patron was indescribable .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 62]: He laid out a portion of his gold in a suit of plain clothes , white linen shirts , and in every respect the wardrobe of a man of fashion ; in fact , he was now a complete gentleman 's gentleman ; was very particular in frizzing his woolly hair -- wore a white neck-cloth , gloves , and cane .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 35]: Every one felt inclined to laugh when he made his appearance ; but there was something in Mesty 's look , which , at all events , prevented their doing so before his face .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 6]: The day for sailing arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 33]: Jack took leave of the Governor , thanking him for his great kindness , and stating his intention of taking Malta in his way out to Palermo in a month or two .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 28]: Gascoigne went on board with him , and did not go down the vessel 's side till it was more than a mile clear of the harbour .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 33]: CHAPTER XXXV Mr Easy 's wonderful invention fully explained by himself -- much to the satisfaction of our hero , and it is to be presumed to that also of the reader .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 9]: At last the packet anchored in Falmouth Roads .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 51]: Jack , accompanied by Mesty , was soon on shore with his luggage , threw himself into the mail , arrived in London , and , waiting there two or three days , to obtain what he considered necessary from a fashionable tailor , ordered a chaise to Forest Hill .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 30]: He had not written to his father to announce his arrival , and it was late in the morning when the chaise drew up at his father 's door .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 8]: Jack stepped out and rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 21]: The servants who opened the door did not know him ; they were not the same as those he left .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 7]: `` Where is Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 3]: demanded Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 6]: `` Who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 11]: replied one of the men , in a gruff tone .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 18]: `` By de powers , you very soon find out who he is , '' observed Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 15]: `` Stay here , and I 'll see if he is at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 4]: `` Stay here ?
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 8]: stay in the hall like a footman ?
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 9]: What do you mean , you rascal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 10]: cried Jack , attempting to push by the man .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 25]: `` O , that wo n't do here , master ; this is Equality Hall ; one man 's as good as another . ''
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 12]: `` Not always , '' replied Jack , knocking him down .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 22]: `` Take that for your insolence , pack up your traps , and walk out of the house to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 14]: Mesty , in the meantime , had seized the other by the throat .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 12]: `` What I do with this fellow , Massa Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 15]: `` Leave him now , Mesty : we 'll settle their account to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 12]: I presume I shall find my father in the library . ''
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 5]: `` His father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 22]: said one of the men to the other ; `` he 's not exactly a chip off the old block . ''
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 20]: `` We shall have a change , I expect , '' replied the other , as they walked away .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 44]: `` Mesty , '' cried Jack , in an authoritative tone , `` bring those two rascals back to take the luggage out of the chaise ; pay the position , and tell the housekeeper to show you my room , and yours .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 14]: Come to me for orders as soon as you have done this . ''
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 33]: `` Now come here , you d -- n blackguard , and take tings out of chaise , or by de holy poker I choak your luff , both of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 18]: The filed teeth , the savage look , and determination of Mesty , had the due effect .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 10]: The men sullenly returned , and unloaded the chaise .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 32]: In the meantime , Jack walked into his father 's study ; his father was there -- the study was lighted up with argand lamps , and Jack looked with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 30]: Mr Easy was busy with a plaster cast of a human head , which he pored over , so that he did not perceive the entrance of his son .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 29]: The cast of the skull was divided into many compartments , with writing on each ; but what most astonished our hero was the alteration in the apartment .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 65]: The book-cases and books had all been removed , and in the centre , suspended from the ceiling , was an apparatus which would have puzzled anyone , composed of rods in every direction , with screws at the end of them , and also tubes in equal number , one of which communicated with a large air-pump , which stood on a table .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 17]: Jack took a short survey , and then walked up to his father and accosted him .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 9]: exclaimed Mr Easy , `` is it possible ?
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 9]: -- yes , it is my son John !
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 61]: I 'm glad to see you , John , -- very glad , indeed , '' continued the old gentleman , shaking him by both hands -- `` very glad that you have come home ; I wanted you -- wanted your assistance in my great and glorious project , which , I thank Heaven , is now advancing rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 13]: Very soon shall equality and the rights of man be proclaimed everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 20]: The pressure from without is enormous , and the bulwarks of our ridiculous and tyrannical constitution must give way .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 44]: King , lords , and aristocrats ; landholders , tithe-collectors , church and state , thank God , will soon be overthrown , and the golden age revived -- the millennium -- the true millennium -- not what your poor mother talked about .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 48]: I am at the head of twenty-nine societies , and if my health lasts , you will see what I will accomplish now that I have your assistance , Jack '' ; and Mr Easy 's eyes sparkled and flashed in all the brilliancy of incipient insanity .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 24]: Jack sighed , and to turn the conversation he observed , `` You have made a great change in this room , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 7]: What may all this be for ?
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 14]: Is it a machine to improve equality and the rights of man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 123]: `` My dear son , '' replied Mr Easy , sitting down and crossing his legs complacently , with his two hands under his right thigh , according to his usual custom , when much pleased with himself , -- `` why , my dear son , that is not exactly the case , and yet you have shown some degree of perception even in your guess ; for if my invention succeeds -LRB- and I have no doubt of it -RRB- , I shall have discovered the great art of rectifying the mistakes of nature , and giving an equality of organisation to the whole species , of introducing all the finer organs of humanity , and of destroying the baser .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 11]: It is a splendid invention , Jack , very splendid .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 18]: They may talk of Call and Spurzheim , and all those ; but what have they done ?
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 28]: nothing but divided the brain into sections , classed the organs , and discovered where they reside ; but what good result has been gained from that ?
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 22]: the murderer by nature remained a murderer -- the benevolent man a benevolent man -- he could not alter his organisation .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 11]: I have found out how to change all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 16]: `` Surely , sir , you would not interfere with the organ of benevolence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 8]: `` But indeed I must , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 58]: I , myself , am suffering from my organ of benevolence being too large : I must reduce it , and then I shall be capable of greater things , shall not be so terrified by difficulties , shall overlook trifles , and only carry on great schemes for universal equality and the supreme rights of man .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 33]: I have put myself into that machine every morning for two hours , for these last three months , and I feel now that I am daily losing a great portion . ''
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 17]: `` Will you do me the favour to explain an invention so extraordinary , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 4]: said our hero .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 7]: `` Most willingly , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 34]: You observe that in the centre there is a frame to confine the human head , somewhat larger than the head itself , and that the head rests upon the iron collar beneath .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 41]: When the head is thus firmly fixed , suppose I want to reduce the size of any particular organ , I take the boss corresponding to where that organ is situated in the cranium , and fix it on it .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 29]: For you will observe that all the bosses inside of the top of the frame correspond to the organs as described in this plaster cast on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 28]: I then screw down pretty tight , and increase the pressure daily , until the organ disappears altogether , or is reduced to the size required . ''
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 35]: `` I comprehend that part perfectly , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` but now explain to me by what method you contrive to raise an organ which does not previously exist . ''
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 31]: `` That , '' replied Mr Easy , `` is the greatest perfection of the whole invention , for without I could do that , I could have done little .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 12]: I feel convinced that this invention of mine will immortalise me .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 42]: Observe all these little bell-glasses which communicate with the air-pump ; I shave my patient 's head , grease it a little , and fix on the bell-glass , which is exactly shaped to fit the organ in length and breadth .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 14]: I work the air-pump , and raise the organ by an exhausted receiver .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 5]: It can not fail .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 22]: There is my butler , now ; a man who escaped hanging last spring assizes on an undoubted charge of murder .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 27]: I selected him on purpose ; I have flattened down murder to nothing , and I have raised benevolence till it 's like a wen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 38]: `` I am afraid my poor father 's head is an exhausted receiver , '' thought Jack , who then replied , `` Well , sir , if it succeeds it will be a good invention . ''
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 5]: `` If it succeeds !
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 12]: -- why , it has succeeded -- it can not fail .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 9]: It has cost me near two thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 80]: By-the-bye , Jack , you have drawn very liberally lately , and I had some trouble , with my own expenses , to meet your bills ; not that I complain -- but what with societies , and my machine , and tenants refusing to pay their rents , on the principle that the farms are no more mine than theirs , which I admit to be true , I have had some difficulty in meeting all demands . ''
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 17]: `` The Governor was right , '' thought Jack , who now inquired after Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 7]: `` Ah , poor silly man !
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 10]: he 's alive yet -- I believe doing well .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 31]: He is one who will interfere with the business of others , complains of my servants -- very silly man indeed -- but I let him have his own way .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 7]: So I did your poor mother .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 12]: Silly woman , Mrs Easy -- but never mind that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 41]: `` If you please , sir , I have also a complaint to make of the servants for their insolence to me : but we will adjourn , if you please , as I wish to have some refreshment . ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 16]: `` Certainly , Jack , if you are hungry ; I will go with you .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 8]: Complain of my servants , say you ?
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 38]: -- there must be some mistake -- they are all shaved , and wear wigs , and I put them in the machine every other morning : but I mean to make an alteration in one respect .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 43]: You observe , Jack , it requires more dignity : we must raise the whole machinery some feet , ascend it with state as a throne , for it is the throne of reason , the victory of mind over nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 16]: `` As you please , sir ; but I am really hungry just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 23]: Jack and his father went into the drawing-room and rang the bell ; not being answered , Jack rose and rang again .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 36]: `` My dear sir , '' observed Mr Easy , `` you must not be in a hurry ; every man naturally provides for his own wants first , and afterwards for those of others .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 21]: Now my servants -- '' `` Are a set of insolent scoundrels , sir , and insolence I never permit .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 27]: I knocked one down as I entered your house , and , with your permission , I will discharge two , at least , to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 17]: `` My dear son , '' exclaimed Mr Easy , `` you knocked my servant down !
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 53]: -- are you not aware , by the laws of equality -- '' `` I am aware of this , my dear father , '' replied Jack , `` that by all the laws of society we have a right to expect civility and obedience from those we pay and feed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 5]: `` Pay and feed !
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 52]: Why , my dear son , -- my dear Jack , -- you must recollect -- '' `` I recollect , sir , very well ; but if your servants do not come to their recollection in a very short time , either I or they must quit the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 17]: `` But , my dear boy , have you forgotten the principles I instilled into you ?
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 19]: Did you not go to sea to obtain that equality foiled by tyranny and despotism here on shore ?
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 10]: Do you not acknowledge and support my philosophy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 27]: `` We 'll argue that point to-morrow , sir -- at present I want to obtain my supper '' ; and Jack rang the bell furiously .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 25]: The butler made his appearance at this last summons , and he was followed by Mesty , who looked like a demon with anger .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 11]: `` Mercy on me , whom have we here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 27]: `` My servant , father , '' exclaimed Jack , starting up ; `` one that I can trust to , and who will obey me .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 23]: Mesty , I wish some supper and wine to be brought immediately -- see that scoundrel gets it ready in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 17]: If he does not , throw him out of the door , and lock him out .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 5]: You understand me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 24]: `` Yes , Massa , '' grinned Mesty ; `` now you hab supper very quick , or Mesty know the reason why .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 44]: Follow me , sar , '' cried Mesty , in an imperative tone to the butler : `` quick , sar , or by de holy poker , I show you what Mesty can do ; '' and Mesty grinned in his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 30]: `` Bring supper and wine immediately , '' said Mr Easy , giving an order such as the butler had never heard since he had been in the house .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 11]: The butler quitted the room , followed by the Ashantee .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 40]: `` My dear boy -- my Jack -- I can make every allowance for hunger , it is often the cause of theft and crime in the present unnatural state of society -- but really you are too violent .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 4]: The principles . ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 18]: `` Your principles are all confounded nonsense , father , '' cried Jack , in a rage .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 5]: `` What , Jack !
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 7]: -- my son-what do I hear ?
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 6]: This from you -- nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 14]: Why , Jack , what has Captain Wilson been doing with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 10]: `` Bringing me to my senses , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 4]: `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 3]: oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 13]: my dear Jack , you will certainly make me lose mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 8]: `` Gone already , '' thought Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 51]: `` That you , my child , so carefully brought up in the great and glorious school of philosophy , should behave this way -- should be so violent -- forget your sublime philosophy , and all -- just like Esau , selling your birthright for a mess of pottage .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 9]: Oh , Jack , you 'll kill me !
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 18]: and yet I love you , Jack -- whom else have I to love in this world ?
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 27]: Never mind , we 'll argue the point , my boy -- I 'll convince you -- in a week all will be right again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 16]: `` It shall , sir , if I can manage it , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 38]: `` That 's right , I love to hear you say so -- that 's consoling , very consoling -- but I think now , I was wrong to let you go to sea , Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 9]: `` Indeed you were not , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 68]: `` Well , I 'm glad to hear you say so : I thought they had ruined you , destroyed all your philosophy -- but it will be all right again -- you shall come to our societies , Jack -- I am president -- you shall hear me speak , Jack -- you shall hear me thunder like Demosthenes -- but here comes the tray . ''
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 35]: The butler , followed by Mesty , who attended him as if he was his prisoner , now made his appearance with the tray , laid it down in a sulky manner and retired .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 6]: Jack desired Mesty to remain .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 17]: `` Well , Mesty , how are they getting on in the servants ' hall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 25]: `` Regular mutiny , sar -- ab swear dat they no stand our nonsense , and dat we both leave the house to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 7]: `` Do you hear , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 12]: your servants declare that I shall leave your house to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 14]: `` You leave my house , Jack , after four years ' absence !
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 5]: -- no , no .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 13]: I 'll reason with them -- I 'll make them a speech .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 12]: You do n't know how I can speak , Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 35]: `` Look you , father , I can not stand this ; either give me a carte-blanche to arrange this household as I please , or I shall quit it myself to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 7]: `` Quit my house , Jack !
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 37]: no , no -- shake hands and make friends with them ; be civil , and they will serve you -- but you know , upon the principles - '' `` Principles of the devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 7]: cried Jack , in a rage .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 10]: `` Of the devil , Jack ; dear me !
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 10]: I wish you had never gone to sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 20]: `` In one word , sir , do you consent , or am I to leave the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 5]: `` Leave the house !
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 10]: O no ; not leave the house , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 7]: I have no son but you .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 33]: Then do as you please -- but you must not send away my murderer , for I must have him cured , and shown as a proof of my wonderful invention . ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 21]: `` Mesty , get my pistols ready for to-morrow morning , and your own too -- do ye hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 17]: `` All ready , massa , '' replied Mesty ; `` I tink dat right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 3]: `` Right !
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 5]: -- pistols , Jack !
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 6]: What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 28]: `` It is possible , father , that you may not have yet quite cured your murderer , and therefore it is as well to be prepared .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 42]: I will now wish you good-night ; but , before I go , you will be pleased to summon one of the servants , that he may inform the others that the household is under my control for the future . ''
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 15]: The bell was again rung , and was this time answered with more expedition .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 46]: Jack told the servant , in presence of his father , that , with the consent of the latter , he should hereafter take the whole control of the establishment , and that Mesty would be the majordomo from whom they would receive their orders .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 42]: The man stared , and cast an appealing look to Mr Easy , who hesitated , and at last said -- `` Yes , William ; you 'll apologise to all , and say that I have made the arrangement . ''
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 26]: `` You apologise to none , sir , '' cried Jack ; `` but tell them that I will arrange the whole business to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 12]: Tell the woman to come here and show me my bed-room .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 30]: Mesty , get your supper and then come up to me ; if they dare to refuse you , recollect who does , and point them out to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 16]: That will do , sir ; away with you , and bring flat candlesticks . ''
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 29]: CHAPTER XXXVI In which Jack takes up the other side of the argument , and proves that he can argue as well on one side as the other .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 20]: This scene may give some idea of the state of Mr Easy 's household upon our hero 's arrival .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 29]: The poor lunatic , for such we must call him , was at the mercy of his servants , who robbed , laughed at , and neglected him .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 7]: The waste and expense were enormous .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 26]: Our hero , who found how matters stood , went to bed , and lay the best part of the night resolving what to do .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 12]: He determined to send for Dr Middleton , and consult him .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 24]: The next morning , Jack rose early ; Mesty was in the room , with warm water , as soon as he rang .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 16]: `` By de power , Massa Easy , your fader very silly old man . ''
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 10]: `` I 'm afraid so , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 17]: `` He not right here , '' observed Mesty , putting his fingers to his head .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 17]: Jack sighed , and desired Mesty to send one of the grooms up to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 24]: When the man knocked he desired him to mount a horse and ride over to Dr Middleton , and request his immediate attendance .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 25]: The man , who was really a good servant , replied , `` Yes , sir , '' very respectfully , and hastened away .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 61]: Jack went down to breakfast , and found it all ready , but his father was not in the room : he went to his study , and found him occupied , with the carpenter , who was making a sort of a frame as the model of the platform or dais , to be raised under the wonderful invention .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 19]: Mr Easy was so busy that he could not come to breakfast , so Jack took his alone .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 15]: An hour after this , Dr Middleton 's carriage drove up to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 7]: The Doctor heartily greeted our hero .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 24]: `` My dear sir -- for so I suppose I must now call you -- I am heartily glad that you have returned .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 14]: I can assure you that it is not a moment too soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 18]: `` I have found out that already , Doctor , '' replied Jack ; `` sit down .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 5]: Have you breakfasted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 25]: `` No , I have not ; for I was so anxious to see you , that I ordered my carriage at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 16]: `` Then sit down , Doctor , and we will talk over matters quietly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 11]: `` You of course perceive the state of your father .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 14]: He has been some time quite unfit to manage his own affairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 7]: `` So I am afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 19]: `` What do you intend to do , then -- put them in the hands of trustees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 11]: `` I will be trustee for myself , Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 26]: I could not do the other without submitting my poor father to a process , and confinement , which I can not think of . ''
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 41]: `` I can assure you , that there are not many in Bedlam worse than he is ; but I perfectly agree with you ; that is , if he will consent to your taking charge of the property . ''
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 47]: `` A power of attorney will be all that is requisite , '' replied Jack ; `` that is , as soon as I have rid the house of the set of miscreants who are in it ; and who are now in open mutiny . ''
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 17]: `` I think , '' replied the Doctor , `` that you will have some trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 9]: You know the character of the butler . ''
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 13]: `` Yes , I have it from my father 's own mouth .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 23]: I really should take it as a great favour , Dr Middleton , if you could stay here a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 10]: I know that you have retired from practice . ''
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 13]: `` I would have made the same offer , my young friend .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 17]: I will come here with two of my servants ; for you must discharge these . ''
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 20]: `` I have one of my own who is worth his weight in gold -- that will be sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 29]: I will dismiss every man you think I ought ; and as for the women , we can give them warning , and replace them at leisure . ''
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 14]: `` That is exactly what I should propose , '' replied the Doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 38]: `` I will now go , if you please ; procure the assistance of a couple of constables , and also of your father 's former legal adviser , who shall prepare a power of attorney . ''
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 36]: `` Yes , '' replied Jack , `` and we must then find out the tenants who refuse to pay upon the principles of equality , and he shall serve them with notice immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 24]: `` I am rejoiced , my dear young friend , to perceive that your father 's absurd notions have not taken root . ''
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 16]: `` They lasted some time , nevertheless , Doctor , '' replied Jack , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 39]: `` Well , then , I will only quit you for an hour or two , and then , as you wish it , will take up my quarters here as long as you find me useful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 28]: In the forenoon , Dr Middleton again made his appearance , accompanied by Mr Hanson , the solicitor , bringing with him his portmanteau and his servants .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 16]: Mr Easy had come into the parlour , and was at breakfast when they entered .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 62]: He received them very coolly ; but a little judicious praise of the wonderful invention had its due effect ; and after Jack had reminded him of his promise that , in future , he was to control the household , he was easily persuaded to sign the order for his so doing -- that is , the power of attorney .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 46]: Mr Easy also gave up to Jack the key of his escritoire , and Mr Hanson possessed himself of the books , papers , and receipts necessary to ascertain the state of his affairs , and the rents which had not yet been paid up .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 7]: In the meantime the constables arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 72]: The servants were all summoned ; Mr Hanson showed them the power of attorney , empowering Jack to act for his father , and , in less than half an hour afterwards , all the men-servants , but two grooms , were dismissed ; the presence of the constables and Mesty prevented any resistance , but not without various threats on the part of the butler , whose name was O'Rourke .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 15]: Thus , in twenty-four hours , Jack had made a reformation in the household .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 18]: Mr Easy took no notice of anything ; he returned to his study and his wonderful invention .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 19]: Mesty had received the keys of the cellar , and had now complete control over those who remained .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 27]: Dr Middleton , Mr Hanson , Mr Easy , and Jack , sat down to dinner , and everything wore the appearance of order and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 32]: Mr Easy ate very heartily , but said nothing till after dinner , when as was his usual custom , he commenced arguing upon the truth and soundness of his philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 26]: `` By-the-bye , my dear son , if I recollect right , you told me last night that you were no longer of my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 13]: Now , if you please , we will argue this point . ''
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 23]: `` I 'll argue the point with all my heart , sir , '' replied Jack , `` will you begin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 35]: `` Let 's fill our glasses , '' cried Mr Easy , triumphantly ; `` let 's fill our glasses , and then I will bring Jack back to the proper way of thinking .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 20]: Now then , my son , I trust you will not deny that we are all born equal . ''
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 36]: `` I do deny it , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` I deny it in toto -- deny it from the evidence of our own senses , and from the authority of Scripture .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 37]: To suppose all men were born equal , is to suppose that they are equally endowed with the same strength , and with the same capacity of mind , which we know is not the case .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 52]: I deny it from Scripture , from which I could quote many passages ; but I will restrict myself to one -- the parable of the Talents : ` To one he gave five talents , to another but one , ' holding them responsible for the trust reposed in them .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 19]: We are all intended to fill various situations in society , and are provided by Heaven accordingly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 31]: `` That may be , '' replied Mr Easy ; `` but that does not prove that the earth was not intended to be equally distributed among all alike . ''
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 36]: `` I beg your pardon ; the proof that that was not the intention of Providence , is that that equality , allowing it to be put in practice , could never be maintained . ''
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 4]: `` Not maintained !
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 23]: -- no , because the strong oppress the weak , tyrants rise up and conquer -- men combine to do wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 31]: `` Not so , my dear father ; I say it could not be maintained without the organisation of each individual had been equalised , and several other points established .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 18]: For instance , allowing that every man had , ab origins , a certain portion of ground .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 26]: He who was the strongest or the cleverest would soon cause his to yield more than others would , and thus the equality be destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 42]: Again , if one couple had ten children and another had none , then again would equality be broken in upon , as the land that supports two in the one instance , would have to feed twelve in the other .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 19]: You perceive , therefore , that without rapine or injustice , your equality could not be preserved . ''
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 65]: `` But , Jack , allowing that there might be some diversity from such causes , that would be a very different thing from the present monstrous state of society , in which we have kings and lords , and people , rolling in wealth , while others are in a state of pauperism , and obliged to steal for their daily bread . ''
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 74]: `` My dear father , I consider that it is to this inequality that society owes its firmest cementation -- that we are enabled to live in peace and happiness , protected by just laws , each doing his duty in that state of life to which he is called , rising above or sinking in the scale of society according as he has been entrusted with the five talents or the one .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 7]: Equality can and does exist nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 20]: We are told that it does not exist in heaven itself -- how can it exist upon earth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 22]: `` But that is only asserted , Jack , and it is not proof that it ought not to exist . ''
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 11]: `` Let us argue the point , father , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 15]: Let us examine a little what would be the effect if all was equality .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 63]: Were all equal in beauty there would be no beauty , for beauty is only by comparison -- were all equal in strength , conflicts would be interminable -- were all equal in rank , and power , and possessions , the greatest charms of existence would be destroyed -- generosity , gratitude , and half the finer virtues would be unknown .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 37]: The first principle of our religion , charity , could not be practised -- pity would never be called forth -- benevolence , your great organ , would be useless , and self-denial a blank letter .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 40]: Were all equal in ability , there would be no instruction , no talent , no genius -- nothing to admire , nothing to copy , to respect -- nothing to rouse emulation , or stimulate to praiseworthy ambition .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 26]: Why , my dear father , what an idle , unprofitable , weary world would this be , if it were based on equality ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 44]: `` But , allowing all that , Jack , '' replied Mr Easy , `` and I will say you argue well in a bad cause , why should the inequality be carried so far -- king and lords , for instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 32]: `` The most lasting and imperishable form of building is that of the pyramid , which defies ages , and to that may the most perfect form of society be compared .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 39]: It is based upon the many , and rising by degrees , it becomes less as wealth , talent , and rank increase in the individual , until it ends at the apex or monarch , above all .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 28]: Yet each several stone from the apex to the base is necessary for the preservation of the structure , and fulfils its duty in its allotted place .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 71]: Could you prove that those at the summit possess the greatest share of happiness in this world , then , indeed , you have a position to argue on ; but it is well known that such is not the case ; and provided he is of a contented mind , the peasant is more happy than the king , surrounded as the latter is by cares and anxiety . ''
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 16]: `` Very well argued , indeed , my dear sir , '' observed Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 23]: `` But , my dear boy , there are other states of society than monarchy ; we have republics and despotisms . ''
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 15]: `` We have , but how long do they last compared to the first ?
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 11]: There is a cycle in the changes which never varies .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 58]: A monarchy may be overthrown by a revolution , and republicanism succeed , but that is shortly followed by despotism , till , after a time , monarchy succeeds again by unanimous consent , as the most legitimate and equitable form of government ; but in none of these do you find a single advance to equality .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 37]: In a republic , those who govern are more powerful than the rulers in a restricted monarchy -- a president is greater than a king , and next to a despot , whose will is law .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 18]: Even in small societies you find , that some will naturally take the lead and assume domination .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 25]: We commence the system at school , when we are first thrown into society , and there we are taught systems of petty tyranny .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 74]: There are some few points in which we obtain equality in this world , and that equality can only be obtained under a well-regulated form of society , and consists in an equal administration of justice and of laws , to which we have agreed to submit for the benefit of the whole -- the equal right to live and not be permitted to starve , which has been obtained in this country .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 14]: And when we are called to account , we shall have equal justice .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 11]: Now my dear father , you have my opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 22]: `` Yes , my dear , this is all very well in the abstract ; but how does it work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 5]: `` It works well .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 36]: The luxury , the pampered state , the idleness -- if you please , the wickedness -- of the rich , all contribute to the support , the comfort , and employment of the poor .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 28]: You may behold extravagance it is a vice ; but that very extravagance circulates money , and the vice of one contributes to the happiness of many .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 15]: The only vice which is not redeemed by producing commensurate good , is avarice .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 20]: If all were equal , there would be no arts , no manufactures , no industry , no employment .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 56]: As it is , the inequality of the distribution of wealth may be compared to the heart , pouring forth the blood like a steam-engine through the human frame , the same blood returning from the extremities by the veins , to be again propelled , and keep up a healthy and vigorous circulation . ''
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 6]: `` Bravo , Jack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 4]: said Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 10]: `` Have you anything to reply , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 7]: continued he , addressing Mr Easy .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 7]: `` To reply , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 37]: replied Mr Easy , with scorn ; `` why , he has not given me half an argument yet : why that black servant even laughs at him -- look at him there showing his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 8]: Can he forget the horrors of slavery ?
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 8]: can he forget the base unfeeling lash ?
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 18]: No , sir , he has suffered , and he can estimate the divine right of equality .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 24]: Ask him now , ask him , if you dare , Jack , whether he will admit the truth of your argument . ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 27]: `` Well , I 'll ask him , '' replied Jack , `` and I tell you candidly that he was once one of your disciples .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 10]: Mesty , what 's your opinion of equality ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 7]: `` Equality , Massa Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 21]: replied Mesty , pulling up his cravat ; `` I say d -- n equality , now I majordomo . ''
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 13]: `` The rascal deserves to be a slave all his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 17]: `` True , I ab been slave -- but I a prince in my own country .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 10]: Massa Easy tell how many skulls I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 14]: `` Skulls -- skulls -- do you know anything of the sublime science ?
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 6]: Are you a phrenologist ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 15]: `` I know man 's skull very well in Ashantee country , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 12]: `` Then if you know that , you must be one .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 19]: I had no idea that the science had extended so far -- maybe it was brought from thence .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 9]: I will have some talk with you to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 5]: This is very curious .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 8]: Dr Middleton , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 9]: `` Very , indeed , Mr Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 25]: `` I shall feel his head to-morrow after breakfast , and if there is anything wrong , I shall correct it with my machine .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 39]: By-the-bye , I have quite forgot , gentlemen ; you will excuse me , but I wish to see what the carpenter has done for me , and after that I shall attend the meeting of the society .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 15]: Jack , my boy , wo n't you come and hear my speech ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 16]: `` Thank you , sir , but I can not well leave your friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 6]: Mr Easy quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 22]: `` Are you aware , my dear sir , that your father has opened his preserves to all the poachers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 4]: said Mr Hanson .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 7]: `` The devil he has ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 35]: `` Yes , he has allowed several gangs of gipsies to locate themselves in his woods much to the annoyance of the neighbourhood , who suffer from their depredations , '' continued Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 36]: `` I find , by the receipts and books , that there is nearly two years rental of the estate due ; some tenants have paid up in full , others not for four years .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 10]: I reckon fourteen thousand pounds still in arrear . ''
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 22]: `` You will oblige me by taking immediate steps , Mr Hanson , for the recovery of the sums due . ''
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 7]: `` Most certainly , Mr John .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 16]: I trust your father will not commit himself to-night as he has done lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 16]: When they rose to retire , Dr Middleton took out , hero by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 41]: `` You do not know , my dear fellow , what pleasure it gives me to find that , in spite of the doting of your mother and the madness of your father , you have turned out so well .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 21]: It is very fortunate that you have come home ; I trust you will now give up the profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 46]: `` I have given it up , sir ; which , by-the-bye , reminds me that I have not applied for either my discharge or that of my servant ; but I can not spare time yet , so I shall not report myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 25]: CHAPTER XXXVII In which our hero finds himself an orphan , and resolves to go to sea again without the smallest idea of equality .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 27]: The next morning , when they met at breakfast , Mr Easy did not make his appearance , and Jack inquired of Mesty where he was .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 16]: `` They say down below that the old gentleman not come home last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 7]: `` Did not come home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 12]: said Dr Middleton ; `` this must be looked to . ''
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 31]: `` He great rascal , dat butler man , '' said Mesty to Jack ; `` but de old gentleman not sleep in his bed , dat for sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 12]: `` Make enquiries when he went out , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 24]: `` I hope no accident has happened , '' observed Mr Hanson ; `` but his company has lately been very strange . ''
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 16]: `` Nobody see him go out , sar , last night , '' reported Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 31]: `` Very likely he is in his study , '' observed Dr Middleton ; `` he may have remained all night , fast asleep , by his wonderful invention . ''
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 11]: `` I 'll go and see , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 9]: Dr Middleton accompanied him , and Mesty followed .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 16]: They opened the door , and beheld a spectacle which made them recoil with horror .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 30]: There was Mr Easy , with his head in the machine , the platform below fallen from under him , hanging , with his toes just touching the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 55]: Dr Middleton hastened to him , and , assisted by Mesty and our hero , took him out of the steel collar which was round his neck : but life had been extinct for many hours , and , on examination , it was found that the poor old gentleman 's neck was dislocated .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 23]: It was surmised that the accident must have taken place the evening before , and it was easy to account for it .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 55]: Mr Easy , who had had the machine raised four feet higher , for the platform and steps to be placed underneath , must have mounted on the frame modelled by the carpenter for his work , and have fixed his head in , for the knob was pressed on his bump of benevolence .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 28]: The framework , hastily put together with a few short nails , had given way with his weight , and the sudden fall had dislocated his neck .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 48]: Mr Hanson led away our hero , who was much shocked at this unfortunate and tragical end of his poor father , while Dr Middleton ordered the body to be taken up into a bed-room , and immediately despatched a messenger to the coroner of the county .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 39]: Poor Mr Easy had told his son but the day before , that he felt convinced that this wonderful invention would immortalise him , and so it had , although not exactly in the sense that he anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 22]: We must pass over the few days of sorrow , and closed shutters , which always are given to these scenes .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 36]: The coroner 's inquest and the funeral over , daylight was again admitted , our hero 's spirits revived , and he found himself in possession of a splendid property , and his own master .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 35]: He was not of age , it is true , for he wanted nine months ; but on opening the will of his father , he found that Dr Middleton was his sole guardian .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 68]: Mr Hanson , on examining and collecting the papers , which were in the greatest confusion , discovered bank-notes in different corners , and huddled up with bills and receipts , to the amount of two thousand pounds , and further , a cheque signed by Captain Wilson on his banker , for the thousand pounds advanced by Mr Easy , dated more than fifteen months back .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 39]: Dr Middleton wrote to the Admiralty , informing them that family affairs necessitated Mr John Easy , who had been left at sick quarters , to leave his Majesty 's service , requesting his discharge from it forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 18]: The Admiralty were graciously pleased to grant the request , and lose the services of a midshipman .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 23]: The Admiralty were also pleased to grant the discharge of Mesty , on the sum required for a substitute being paid in .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 16]: The gipsies were routed out of their abodes , and sent once more to wander .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 43]: The gamekeepers were restored , the preserves cleared of all poachers , and the gentry of the country were not a little pleased at Jack 's succession , for they had wished that Mr Easy 's neck had been broken long ago .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 25]: The societies were dissolved , since , now that Mr Easy no longer paid for the beer , there was nothing to meet for .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 52]: Cards and compliments were sent from all parts of the county , and every one was anxious that our hero should come of age , as then he would be able to marry , to give dinners , subscribe to the foxhounds , and live as a gentleman ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 44]: But during all these speculations , Jack had made Dr Middleton acquainted with the history of his amour with Agnes de Rebiera , and all particulars connected therewith , also with his determination to go out to bring her home as his wife .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 18]: Dr Middleton saw no objection to the match , and he perceived that our hero was sincere .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 33]: And Jack had made inquiries when the packet would sail for Malta , when Mesty , who stood behind his chair , observed , -- `` Packet bad vessel , Massa Easy .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 8]: Why not go out in man-of-war ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 22]: `` Very true , '' replied Jack ; `` but you know , Mesty , that is not so easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 9]: `` And den how come home , sar ?
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 13]: Suppose you and Missy Agnes taken prisoner -- put in prison ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 27]: `` Very true , '' replied Jack ; `` and as for a passage home in a man-of-war , that will be more difficult still . ''
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 37]: `` Den I tink , sar , suppose you buy one fine vessel -- plenty of guns -- take out letter of marque -- plenty of men , and bring Missy Agnes home like a lady .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 8]: You captain of your own ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 30]: `` That deserves consideration , Mesty , '' replied Jack , who thought of it during that night : and the next day resolved to follow Mesty 's advice .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 8]: The Portsmouth paper lay on the breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 68]: Jack took it up , and his eye was caught by an advertisement for the sale of the Joan d'Arc , prize to H.M. ship Thetis , brigantine of 278 tons , copper-bottomed , armed , en flutes with all her stores , spars , sails , running and standing rigging , then lying in the harbour of Portsmouth , to take place on the following Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 9]: Jack rang the bell , and ordered post-horses .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 11]: `` Where are you going , my dear boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 4]: inquired Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 7]: `` To Portsmouth , Doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 13]: `` And pray what for , if not an impertinent question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 30]: Jack then gave Dr Middleton an insight into his plan , and requested that he would allow him to do so , as there was plenty of ready money .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 9]: `` But the expense will be enormous . ''
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 33]: `` It will be heavy , sir , I grant ; but I have calculated it pretty nearly , and I shall not spend at the rate of more than my income .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 30]: Besides , as letter of marque , I shall have the right of capture ; in fact , I mean to take out a privateer 's regular licence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 10]: `` But not to remain there and cruise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 16]: `` No , upon my honour ; I am too anxious to get home again .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 11]: You must not refuse me , my dear guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 26]: `` As a lady is in the case , I will not , my dear boy ; but be careful what you are about . ''
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 38]: `` Never fear , sir , I will be back in four months , at the farthest ; but I must now set off and ascertain if the vessel answers the description given in the advertisement . ''
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 7]: Jack threw himself into the chariot .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 45]: Mesty mounted into the rumble , and in two hours they were at Portsmouth ; went to the agent , viewed the vessel , which proved to be a very fine fast-sailing craft , well found , with six brass carronades on each side .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 18]: The cabins were handsome , fitted up with bird 's - eye maple , and gilt mouldings .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 30]: This will do , thought Jack : a couple of long brass nines , forty men and six boys , and she will be just the thing we require .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 44]: So Mesty and Jack went on shore again , and returned to Forest Hill to dinner , when he desired Mr Hanson to set off for Portsmouth , and bid at the sale for the vessel , as he wished to purchase her .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 28]: This was Monday , and on Wednesday Mr Hanson purchased her , as she stood , for 1,750 pounds , which was considered about half her value .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 17]: Dr Middleton had , in the meantime , been thinking very seriously of Jack 's project .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 28]: He could see no objection to it , provided that he was steady and prudent , but in both these qualities Jack had not exactly been tried .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 37]: He therefore determined to look out for some steady naval lieutenant , and make it a sine qua non that our hero should be accompanied by him , and that he should go out as sailing-master .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 44]: Now that the vessel was purchased , he informed Jack of his wish ; indeed , as Dr Middleton observed , his duty as guardian demanded this precaution , and our hero , who felt very grateful to Dr Middleton , immediately acquiesced .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 36]: `` And , by-the-bye , Doctor , see that he is a good navigator ; for although I can fudge a day 's work pretty well , latterly I have been out of practice . ''
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 54]: Everyone was now busy : Jack and Mesty at Portsmouth , fitting out the vessel , and offering three guineas ahead to the crimps for every good able seaman -- Mr Hanson obtaining the English register , and the letters of licence , and Dr Middleton in search of a good naval dry-nurse .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 24]: Jack found time to write to Don Philip and Agnes , apprising them of the death of his father , and his intentions .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 38]: In about six weeks all was ready , and the brigantine , which had taken out her British register and licence under the name of the Rebiera , went out of harbour , and anchored at Spithead .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 44]: Dr Middleton had procured , as he thought , a very fit person to sail with Jack , and our hero and Mesty embarked , wishing the Doctor and Solicitor good-bye , and leaving them nothing to do but to pay the bills .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 60]: The person selected by Dr Middleton , by the advice of an old friend of his , a purser in the navy , who lived at Southsea , was a Lieutenant Oxbelly , who , with the ship 's company , which had been collected , received our hero as their captain and owner upon his arrival on board .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 48]: There certainly was no small contrast between our hero 's active slight figure and handsome person , set off with a blue coat , something like the present yacht-club uniform , and that of his second in command , who waddled to the side to receive him .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 42]: He was a very short man , with an uncommon protuberance of stomach , with shoulders and arms too short for his body , and hands much too large , more like the paws of a Polar bear than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 9]: He wore trousers , shoes , and buckles .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 23]: On his head was a foraging cap , which , when he took it off , showed that he was quite bald .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 55]: His age might be about fifty-five or sixty ; his complexion florid , no whiskers , and little beard , nose straight , lips thin , teeth black with chewing , and always a little brown dribble from the left corner of his mouth -LRB- there was a leak there , he said -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 19]: Altogether his countenance was prepossessing , for it was honest and manly , but his waist was preposterous .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 16]: `` Steady enough , '' thought Jack , as he returned Mr Oxbelly 's salute .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 9]: `` How do you do , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 21]: said Jack ; `` I trust we shall be good shipmates , '' for Jack had not seen him before .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 30]: `` Mr Easy , '' replied the lieutenant , `` I never quarrel with anyone , except -LRB- I wo n't tell a story -RRB- with my wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 15]: `` I am sorry that you have ever domestic dissensions , Mr Oxbelly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 12]: `` And I only quarrel with her at night , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 38]: She will take up more than her share of the bed , and wo n't allow me to sleep single ; but never mind that , sir ; now will you please to muster the men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 9]: `` If you please , Mr Oxbelly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 25]: The men were mustered , and Jack made them a long speech upon subordination , discipline , activity , duty , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 29]: `` A very good speech , Mr Easy , '' said Mr Oxbelly , as the men went forward ; `` I wish my wife had heard it .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 47]: But , sir , if you please , we 'll now get under way as fast as we can , for there is a Channel cruiser working up at St Helen 's , and we may give him the go-by by running through the Needles . ''
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 12]: `` But what need we care for the Channel cruiser ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 32]: `` You forget , sir , that as soon as she drops her anchor she will come on board and take a fancy to at least ten of our men . ''
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 7]: `` But they are protected . ''
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir , but that 's no protection , now-a-days .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 28]: I have sailed in a privateer at least three years , and I know that they have no respect for letters of marque or for privateers . ''
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 26]: `` I believe you are right , Mr Oxbelly ; so , if you please , we will up with the anchor at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 42]: The crew of the Rebiera had been well chosen ; they were prime men-of-war 's men , most of whom had deserted from the various ships on the station , and , of course , were most anxious to be off .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 17]: In a few minutes the Rebiera was under way with all sail set below and aloft .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 57]: She was in excellent trim and flew through the water ; the wind was fair , and by night they had passed Portland Lights , and the next morning were steering a course for the Bay of Biscay without having encountered what they feared more than an enemy , -- a British cruiser to overhaul them .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 26]: `` I think we shall do now , sir , '' observed Mr Oxbelly to our hero ; `` we have made a famous run .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 23]: It 's twelve o'clock , and if you please I 'll work the latitude , and let you know what it is .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 16]: We must shape our course so as not to run in with the Brest squadron .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 7]: A little more westing , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 8]: I 'll be up in one minute .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 16]: My wife -- but I 'll tell you about that when I come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 9]: `` Latitude 41 degs 12 min , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 32]: I was about to say that my wife , when she was on board of the privateer that I commanded -- '' `` Board of the privateer , Mr Oxbelly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 52]: `` Yes , sir , would go ; told her it was impossible , but she would n't listen to reason -- came on board , flopped herself into the standing bed-place , and said that there she was for the cruise -- little Billy with her -- '' `` What !
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 6]: your child , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 36]: `` Yes , two years old -- fine boy -- always laughed when the guns were fired , while his mother stood on the ladder and held him on the top of the booby-hatch . ''
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 13]: `` I wonder that Mrs Oxbelly let you come here now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 23]: `` So you would , sir , but I 'll explain that -- she thinks I 'm in London about my half-pay .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 33]: She knows all by this time , and frets , I do n't doubt ; but that will make her thin , and then there will be more room in the bed .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 9]: Mrs Oxbelly is a very stout woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 11]: `` Why , you are not a little man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 23]: `` No , not little -- tending to be lusty , as the saying is -- that is , in good condition .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 16]: It 's very strange that Mrs Oxbelly has an idea that she is not large .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 8]: I can not persuade her to it .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 10]: That 's the reason we always spar in bed .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 22]: She says it is I , and I know that it is she who takes the largest share of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 9]: `` Perhaps you may both be right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 14]: `` No , no ; it is she who creates all the disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 21]: If I get nearer to the wall she jams me up till I am as thin as a thread paper .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 31]: If I put her inside and stay outside , she cuts me out as you do a cask , by the chime , till I tumble out of bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 14]: `` Why do n't you make your bed larger , Mr Oxbelly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 29]: `` Sir , I have proposed it , but my wife will have it that the bed is large enough if I would not toss in my sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 6]: I ca n't convince her .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 11]: However , she 'll have it all to herself now .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 17]: I slept well last night , for the first time since I left the Boadicea . ''
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 5]: `` The Boadicea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 17]: `` Yes , sir , I was second lieutenant of the Boadicea for three years . ''
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 12]: `` She 's a fine frigate , I 'm told . ''
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 15]: `` On the contrary , such a pinched-up little craft below I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 32]: Why , Mr Easy , I could hardly get into the door of my cabin -- and yet , as you must see , I 'm not a large man . ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 4]: `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 22]: is it possible , '' thought Jack , `` that this man does not really know that he is monstrous ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 6]: Yet such was the case .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 25]: Mr Oxbelly had no idea that he was otherwise than in good condition , although he had probably not seen his knees for years .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 23]: It was his obesity that was the great objection to him , for in every other point there was nothing against him .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 41]: He had , upon one pretence and another , been shifted , by the manoeuvres of the captains , out of different ships , until he went up to the Admiralty to know if there was any charge against him .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 28]: The first lord at once perceived the charge to be preferred , and made a mark against his name as not fit for anything but harbour duty .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 35]: Out of employment , he had taken the command of a privateer cutter , when his wife , who was excessively fond , would , as he said , follow him with little Billy .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 27]: He was sober , steady , knew his duty well ; but he weighed twenty-six stone , and his weight had swamped him in the service .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 43]: His wish , long indulged , had become , as Shakespeare says , the father of his thoughts and he had really at last brought himself to think that he was not by any means what could be considered a fat man .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 34]: His wife , as he said , was also a very stout woman , and this exuberance of flesh on both sides , was the only , but continual , ground of dispute .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 18]: CHAPTER XXXVIII In which our hero , as usual , gets into the very middle of it .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 43]: On the eleventh day the Rebiera entered the straits , and the rock of Gibraltar was in sight as the sun went down ; after which the wind fell light , and about midnight it became calm , and they drifted up .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 48]: At sunrise they were roused by the report of heavy guns , and perceived an English frigate about eight miles further up the straits , and more in the mid-channel , engaging nine or ten Spanish gun-boats , which had come out from Algesiras to attack her .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 32]: It still continued a dead calm , and the boats of the frigate were all ahead towing her , so as to bring her broadside to bear upon the Spanish flotilla .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 56]: The reverberating of the heavy cannon on both sides over the placid surface of the water -- the white smoke ascending as the sun rose in brilliancy in a clear blue sky -- the distant echoes repeated from the high hills -- had a very beautiful effect for those who are partial to the picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 26]: But Jack thought it advisable to prepare for action instead of watching for tints -- and , in a short time , all was ready .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 43]: `` They 'll not come to us , Mr Easy , as long as they have the frigate to hammer at ; but still we had better be prepared , for we can not well pass them without having a few shot .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 54]: When I came up the straits in the privateer we were attacked by two and fought them for three hours ; their shot dashed the water over our decks till they were wet fore and aft , but somehow or another they never hit us -- we were as low as they were .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 12]: I 'll be bound but they 'll hull the frigate though .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 28]: Mrs Oxbelly and Billy were on deck the whole time -- and Billy was quite delighted , and cried when they took him down to breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 11]: `` Why , Mrs Oxbelly must be very courageous . ''
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 24]: `` Cares neither for shot nor shell , sir -- laughs when they whiz over her head , and tells Billy to hark .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 26]: But , sir , it 's not surprising ; her father is a major , and her two brothers are lieutenants in the bombardiers . ''
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 25]: `` That , indeed , '' replied Jack -- `` but , see , there is a breeze springing up from the westward . ''
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 47]: -- `` Very true , Mr Easy , and a steady one it will be , for it comes up dark and slow ; so much the better for the frigate , for she 'll get little honour and plenty of mauling at this work . ''
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 28]: `` I hope we shall take it up with us , '' observed Jack ; `` how far do you reckon the gun-boats from the shore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 13]: `` I should think about five miles , or rather less . ''
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 24]: `` Trim sails , Mr Oxbelly -- perhaps we may cut one or two of these off -- steer in-shore of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 48]: Up there , my lads , set top-gallant studding sails , topmast studdings to hand -- rig out the booms -- keep as you go now , my lads -- we shall be well in-shore of them , and out of the range of the batteries . ''
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 15]: The breeze came down fresh , and all sail was set upon the Rebiera .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 42]: She took the wind down with her , and it passed her but little -- half a mile ahead of them all was still and smooth as a glass mirror , and they neared and gained in-shore at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 22]: The gun-boats were still engaging the frigate , and did not appear to pay any attention to the Rebiera coming down .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 39]: At last the breeze reached them and the frigate , light at first and then gradually increasing , while the Rebiera foamed through the water , and had now every chance of cutting off some of the gun-boats .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 32]: The frigate trimmed her sails and steered towards the flotilla , which now thought proper to haul off and put their heads in-shore , followed by the frigate firing her bow-chasers .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 18]: But the Rebiera was now within half gun-shot in-shore , and steering so as to intercept them .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 55]: As she rapidly closed , the flotilla scarcely knew how to act ; to attack her would be to lose time , and allow the frigate to come up and occasion their own capture ; so they satisfied themselves with firing at her as she continued to run down between them and the land .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 16]: As they neared , Jack opened his fire with his eighteen-pound carronades and long nines .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 47]: The gun-boats returned his fire , and they were within a quarter of a mile , when Jack shortened sail to his topsails , and a warm engagement took place , which ended in one of the gun-boats being , in a few minutes , dismasted .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 18]: The frigate , under all canvas , came rapidly up , and her shot now fell thick .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 25]: The flotilla then ceased firing , passing about two cables length ahead of the Rebiera , and making all possible sail for the land .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 42]: Jack now fired at the flotilla as they passed , with his larboard broadside , while with his starboard he poured in grape and canister upon the unfortunate gun-boat which was dismasted , and , which soon hauled down her colours .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 54]: In a few minutes more the remainder were too far distant for the carronades , and , as they did not fire , Jack turned his attention to take possession of his prize , sending a boat with ten men on board , and heaving-to close to her to take her in tow .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 30]: Ten minutes more and the frigate was also hove-to a cable 's length from the Rebiera , and our hero lowered down his other quarter-boat to go on board .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 11]: `` Have we any men hurt , Mr Oxbelly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 3]: inquired Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 26]: `` Only two ; Spearling has lost his thumb with a piece of langrage , and James has a bad wound in the thigh . ''
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 16]: `` Very well ; I will ask for the surgeon to come on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 35]: Jack pulled to the frigate , and went up the side , touched his hat in due form , and was introduced by the midshipmen to the other side , where the captain stood .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 5]: `` Mr Easy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 4]: exclaimed the captain .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 5]: `` Captain Sawbridge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 7]: replied our hero , with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 4]: `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 6]: what brought you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 12]: said the captain ; `` and what vessel is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 21]: `` The Rebiera , letter of marque , commanded and owned by Mr Easy , '' replied Jack , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 7]: Captain Sawbridge gave him his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 20]: `` Come down with me into the cabin , Mr Easy ; I am very glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 24]: Give you great credit for your conduct , and am still more anxious to know what has induced you to come out again .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 10]: I knew that you had left the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 41]: Jack , in a very few words , told his object in fitting out the Rebiera ; `` but , '' continued Jack , `` allow me to congratulate you upon your promotion , which I was not aware of .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 19]: May I ask where you left the Harpy , and what is the name of your frigate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 4]: `` The Latona .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 31]: I have only been appointed to her one month , after an action in which the Harpy took a large corvette , and am ordered home with despatches to England .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 22]: We sailed yesterday evening from Gibraltar , were becalmed the whole night , and attacked this morning by the gun-boats . ''
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 9]: `` How is Captain Wilson , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 16]: `` I believe he is very well , but I have not seen him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 19]: `` How did you know , then , that I had left the service , Captain Sawbridge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 12]: `` From Mr Gascoigne , who is now on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 4]: `` Gascoigne ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 4]: exclaimed our hero .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 61]: `` Yes , he was sent up to join the Aurora by the governor , but she had left the fleet , and having served his time , and a passing day being ordered , he passed , and thought he might as well go home with me and see if he could make any interest for his promotion . ''
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 15]: `` Pray , Captain Sawbridge , is the gun-boat our prize or yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 21]: `` It ought to be wholly yours ; but the fact is , by the regulations , we share . ''
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 8]: `` With all my heart , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 19]: Will you send an assistant-surgeon on board to look after two of my men who are hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 21]: `` Yes , directly ; now send your boat away , Easy , with directions to your officer in command .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 26]: We must go back to Gibraltar , for we have received some injury , and , I am sorry to say , lost some men .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 26]: You are going then , I presume , to stay on board and dine with me : we shall be at anchor before night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 8]: `` I will with pleasure , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 15]: But now I will send my boat away and shake hands with Gascoigne . ''
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 27]: Gascoigne was under the half-deck waiting to receive his friend , for he had seen him come up the side from his station on the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 25]: A hurried conversation took place , after our hero had dismissed his boat with the assistant-surgeon in it to dress the two wounded men .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 71]: Jack then went on deck , talked with the officers , looked with pleasure at the Rebiera with the gun-boat in tow , keeping company with the frigate , although only under the same canvas -- promised Gascoigne to spend the next day with him either on shore or on board the Rebiera , and then returned to the cabin , where he had a long conference with Captain Sawbridge .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 59]: `` When you first entered the service , Easy , '' said Captain Sawbridge , `` I thought that the sooner the service was rid of you the better : now that you have left it , I feel that it has lost one who , in all probability , would have proved a credit to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 26]: `` Many thanks , sir , '' replied Jack ; `` but how can I be a midshipman with eight thousand pounds a year ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 31]: `` I agree with you that it is impossible : -- but dinner is serving : go into the after-cabin and the steward will give you all you require . ''
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 35]: Our hero , whose face and hands were not a little grimed with the gunpowder , washed himself , combed out his curly black hair , and found all the party in the fore-cabin .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 25]: Gascoigne , who had not been asked in the forenoon , was , by the consideration of Captain Sawbridge , added to the number .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 30]: Before dinner was long off the table , the first lieutenant reported that it was necessary to turn the hands up , as they were close to the anchorage .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 43]: The party , therefore , broke up sooner than otherwise would have been the case ; and as soon as the Latona 's sails were furled , Captain Sawbridge went on shore to acquaint the governor with the results of the action .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 24]: He asked Jack to accompany him , but our hero , wishing to be with Gascoigne , excused himself until the next day .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 39]: `` And now , Easy , '' said Gascoigne , as soon as the captain had gone over the side , `` I will ask permission to go on board with you -- or will you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 26]: `` I will ask , '' replied Jack ; `` a gentleman of fortune has more weight with a first lieutenant than a midshipman . ''
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 56]: So Jack went up to the first lieutenant , and with one of his polite bows , hoped , `` if duty would permit , he would honour him by coming on board that evening with some of his officers , to see the Rebiera and to drink a bottle or two of champagne . ''
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 88]: The first lieutenant , as the Rebiera was anchored not two cables lengths from him , replied , `` that as soon as he had shifted the prisoners and secured the gun-boat , he would be very glad '' : so did three or four more of the officers , and then Jack begged as a favour , that his old friend , Mr Gascoigne , might be permitted to go with him now , as he had important packages to entrust to his care to England .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 31]: The first lieutenant was very willing , and Gascoigne and our hero jumped into the boat , and were once more in all the confidence of tried and deserved friendship .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 22]: `` Jack , I 've been thinking of it , and I 've made up my mind , '' said Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 39]: `` I shall gain little or nothing by going home for my promotion : I may as well stay here , and as I have served my time and passed , my pay is now of little consequence .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 8]: Will you take me with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 12]: `` It was exactly what I was thinking of , Ned .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 10]: Do you think that Captain Sawbridge will consent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 29]: `` I do : he knows how I am circumstanced , and that my going home was merely because I was tired of looking after the Aurora . ''
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 14]: `` We 'll go together and ask him to-morrow , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 17]: `` At all events , you 'll have a more gentlemanly companion than Mr Oxbelly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 9]: `` But not so steady , Ned . ''
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 15]: The first lieutenant and officers came on board , and passed a merry evening .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 35]: There 's nothing passes time more agreeably away than champagne , and if you do not affront this regal wine by mixing him with any other , he never punishes you the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 19]: CHAPTER XXXIX A council of war , in which Jack decides that he will have one more cruise .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 39]: As Captain Sawbridge did not return on board that evening , Easy went on shore and called upon him at the governor 's , to whom he was introduced , and received an invitation to dine with him .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 54]: As Gascoigne could not come on shore , our hero took this opportunity of making his request to Captain Sawbridge , stating that the person he had with him was not such as he wished and could confide everything to ; that is , not one to whom he could talk about Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 119]: Jack , as he found that Captain Sawbridge did not immediately assent , pressed the matter hard : at last Captain Sawbridge , who reflected that Gascoigne 's interest hereafter would be much greater through his friend Easy , than any other quarter , and that the more the friendship was cemented the more advantageous it might prove to Gascoigne , gave his consent to our hero 's wish , who called on board of the Latona to acquaint Gascoigne and the first lieutenant of Captain Sawbridge 's intentions , and then went on board of the Rebiera and ordered Mesty to come with his portmanteau on shore to the inn , that he might dress for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 53]: Gascoigne , now considered as not belonging to the Latona , was permitted to accompany him : and Jack found himself looking out of the window at which he had hung out his trousers upon the memorable occasion when the boatswain had to follow his own precept , of duty before decency .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 34]: `` What scenes of adventures I have passed through since that , '' thought Jack ; `` not much more than four years ago , then not three weeks in the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 17]: Whereupon Jack fell into a deep reverie , and thought of the baboon and of Agnes .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 30]: The repairs of the Latona were all made good by the next day , and Gascoigne , having received his discharge ticket , went on board of the Rebiera .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 18]: The gun-boat was put into the hands of the agent , and shortly afterwards purchased by government .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 46]: The Rebiera 's crew did not , however , obtain their prize-money and share of the head-money , for she had seventy men on board , until their return , but , as they said , they had broken the ice and that was everything .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 18]: Moreover , it gave them confidence in themselves , in their vessel , and in their commander .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 29]: Our hero weighed a short time after the Latona , having first taken leave of Captain Sawbridge , and committed to his care a letter to Dr Middleton .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 22]: Once more behold the trio together , -- the two midshipmen hanging over the taffrail , and Mesty standing by them .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 24]: They had rounded Europa Point , and , with a fine breeze off the land , were lying close-hauled along the Spanish shore .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 8]: Mr Oxbelly was also walking near them .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 53]: `` When I was cruising here it was very different , '' observed Jack : `` I had a vessel which I did not know how to manage , a crew which I could not command , and had it not been for Mesty , what would have become of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 18]: `` Massa Easy , you know very well how to get out of scrapes , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 14]: `` Yes , and how to get into them , '' continued Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 16]: `` And how to get others out of them , too , Ned . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 18]: ` No more of that , Hal , an thou lovest me ' , '' quoted Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 15]: `` I have often wondered what has been the lot of poor Azar . ''
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 30]: `` The lot of most women , Ned , in every country -- prized at first , neglected afterwards -- the lot she might have had with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 12]: `` Perhaps so , '' replied Ned , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 19]: `` Massa Easy , you get eberybody out of scrape ; you get me out of scrape . ''
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 10]: `` I do not recollect how , Mesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 19]: `` You get me out from boil kettle for young gentlemen -- dat devil of a scrape . ''
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 18]: `` And I 'm sure I 've got you out of a scrape , Mr Oxbelly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 4]: `` How so .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 4]: Mr Easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 4]: `` How so !
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 14]: -- have I not prevented your quarrelling with your wife every night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 11]: `` Certainly , sir , you have been the means .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 36]: But do you know when we were engaging the other day , I could not help saying to myself , I wish my wife was here now , holding little Billy at the hatchway . ''
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 9]: `` But at night , Mr Oxbelly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 4]: `` At night !
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 26]: -- why , then I 'm afraid I should have wished her home again -- it 's astonishing how comfortable I sleep now every night .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 10]: Besides , in this climate it would be intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 13]: Mrs Oxbelly is a very large woman -- very large indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 13]: `` Well , but now we must hold a council of war .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 18]: Are we to run up the coast , or to shape a course direct for Palermo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 18]: `` Course direct , and we shall take nothing , that is certain , '' said Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 15]: `` If we take nothing we shall make no prize-money , '' continued Oxbelly .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 16]: `` If we make no prize-money the men will be discontented , '' said Easy .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 19]: `` If no ab noting to do-it will be d -- d ` tupid , '' continued Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 10]: `` Now then the other side of the question .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 16]: If we steer for Palermo , we shall be sooner there and sooner home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 28]: `` To which I reply , '' said Gascoigne , `` that the shorter the cruise is , the less I shall have of your company . ''
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 15]: `` And I shall have to sleep with Mrs Oxbelly , '' continued Oxbelly .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 19]: `` Hab fine ship , fine gun , fine men , and do noting , '' cried Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 14]: `` By de power , I no like dat , Massa Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 16]: `` You want eight months of coming of age , Jack , '' observed Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 30]: `` It wo n't make a difference of more than three or four weeks , '' said Mr Oxbelly ; `` and the expenses have been very great . ''
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 11]: `` But -- '' `` But what , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 4]: `` Agnes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 19]: `` Agnes will be better defended going home by men who have been accustomed to be in action .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 22]: And , as for her waiting a little longer , it will only make her love you a little more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 20]: `` Sleep single a little longer , Mr Easy , it 's very pleasant , '' said Mr Oxbelly .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 14]: `` That 's not very bad advice of yours , '' observed Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 21]: `` Stop a little , Massa Easy , '' said Mesty , `` you know dat very good advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 21]: `` Well , then , '' replied Jack , `` I will , as I am quite in the minority .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 12]: We will work up the whole coast -- up to Toulon .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 32]: After all , there 's something very pleasant in commanding your own ship , and I 'm not in a hurry to resign it -- so that point 's decided . ''
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 28]: The Rebiera was steered into the land , and at sunset they were not four miles from the lofty blue mountains which overhang the town of Malaga .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 81]: There were many vessels lying at the bottom of the bay , close in with the town ; the wind now fell light , and the Rebiera , as she could not fetch the town , tacked as if she were a merchant vessel standing in , and showed American colours , a hint which they took from perceiving three or four large vessels lying in the outer roads , with the colours of that nation hoisted at the peak .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 9]: `` What is your intention , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 3]: said Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 10]: `` I 'll be hanged if I know yet .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 25]: I think of working up to the outer roads , and anchoring at night -- boarding the American vessels , and gaining intelligence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 30]: `` Not a bad idea ; we shall then learn if there is anything to be done , and if not , we may be off at daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 12]: `` The pratique boat will not come off after sunset . ''
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 33]: `` And if they did , we could pass for an American , bound to Barcelona or anywhere else -- the outer roads where the vessels lie are hardly within gun-shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 48]: Mesty , who had resumed his sailor 's clothes , now observed , `` What we do , Massa Easy , we do quickly -- time for all ting , time for show face and fight -- time for hide face , crawl , and steal . ''
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 18]: `` Very true , Mesty , we 'll crawl this time , and steal if we can .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 13]: It 's not the warfare I like best of the two . ''
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 23]: `` Both good , Massa Easy ; suppose you no steal board of polacca ship , you not see Missy Agnes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 6]: `` Very true , Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 7]: Bout ship , Mr Oxbelly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 17]: `` Mr Oxbelly not good for boat service , '' observed Mesty , showing his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 24]: It was dark before the Rebiera was anchored in the outer roads , a cable 's length astern of the outermost American vessel .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 33]: One of her quarter-boats was lowered down , and Gascoigne and our hero pulled alongside , and , lying on their oars , hailed , and asked the name of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 23]: `` So help me Gad , just now I forget her name , '' replied a negro , looking over the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 7]: `` Who 's the captain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 12]: `` So help me Gad , he gone on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 8]: `` Is the mate on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 15]: `` No , so help me Gad -- he gone shore , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 7]: `` Who is aboard then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 17]: `` So help me Gad , nobody on board but Pompey -- and dat me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 12]: `` Good ship-keepers , at all events , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 16]: `` A ship in the outer roads , with only a black fellow on board !
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 17]: I say , Pompey , do they always leave you in charge of the vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 12]: `` No , sar ; but to-night great pleasure on shore .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 17]: Eberybody dance and sing , get drunk , kick up bobbery , and all dat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 9]: `` What , is it a festival ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 13]: `` So help me Gad , I no know , sar . ''
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 12]: `` Is there anyone on board of the other vessels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 6]: `` Eberybody gone on shore .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 12]: Suppose they have black man , he stay on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 6]: `` Good-night , Pompey . ''
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 5]: `` Good-night , sar .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 11]: Who I say call when captain come on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 5]: `` Captain Easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 10]: `` Captain He-see , very well , sar . ''
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 61]: Our hero pulled to another ship , and found it equally deserted ; but at the third he found the second mate with his arm in a sling , and from him they gained the information that it was a great festival , being the last day of the carnival ; and that everyone was thinking of nothing but amusement .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 21]: `` I 've a notion , '' said the mate , in reply , `` that you 're American . ''
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 10]: `` You 've guessed right , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 10]: `` What ship , and from what port ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 13]: `` Rhode Island , the Susan and Mary , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 7]: `` I thought you were north .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 6]: We 're of New York .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 7]: What news do you bring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 15]: `` Nothing , '' replied he , `` we are from Liverpool last . ''
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 27]: A succession of questions was now put by the American mate , and answered very skilfully by Gascoigne , who then inquired how the market was ?
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 42]: It was necessary to make and reply to all these enquiries before they could ask apparently indifferent questions of American traders ; at last , Gascoigne enquired , -- `` Do you think they would allow us to go on shore ?
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 10]: the pratique boat has not been on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 24]: `` They 'll never find you out if you are off before daylight ; I doubt if they know that you are anchored .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 38]: Besides , from Liverpool you would have a clean bill of health , and if they found it out , they would not say much ; they 're not over particular , I 've a notion . ''
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 9]: `` What are those vessels lying in-shore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 15]: `` I guess they have olive oil on board , the chief on 'em .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 20]: But there are two double lateens come in from Valparaiso the day before yesterday , with hides and copper .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 22]: How they ` scaped the British , I ca n't tell , but they did , that 's sure enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 6]: `` Good-night , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 17]: `` You wo n't take a glass of sling this fine night with a countryman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 17]: `` To-morrow , my good fellow , to-morrow ; we must go on shore now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 28]: Our hero and Gascoigne returned on board the Rebiera , consulted with Oxbelly and Mesty , and then manned and armed the two quarter and stern boats .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 34]: They thought it advisable not to hoist out their long-boat ; no fire-arms were permitted to be taken , lest , going off by accident or otherwise , an alarm should be given .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 36]: Our hero and Mesty proceeded in the first boat , and pulled in for the town ; Gascoigne shortly after in the second , and the boatswain in the jolly-boat , followed at some distance .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 20]: There was no notice taken of them ; they pulled gently down to the landing-place , which was deserted .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 32]: There was a blaze of light , and the sounds of revelry in every quarter on shore ; but the vessels appeared equally deserted as the American ones in the offing .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 36]: Finding themselves unobserved , for they had taken the precaution to pull only two oars in each boat , they dropped gently alongside one of the double-masted lateen vessels , and Mesty stepped on board .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 37]: He peeped down in the cabin , and perceived a man lying on the lockers ; he came up in his stealthy manner , closed the hatch softly , and said , `` All right . ''
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 46]: Jack left Gascoigne to take out this vessel , which he did very successfully , for it was very dark ; and although there were sentries posted not far off , their eyes and ears were turned towards the town , listening to the music .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 31]: A second vessel , her consort , was boarded in the same way , but here they found a man on deck whom they were obliged to seize and gag .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 31]: They put him down in the cabin , and Mesty , with another boat 's crew , cut her cables , and swept her gently out towards the American vessels .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 31]: One more vessel was required , and Jack , pulling two oars as usual , saluted a galliot heavily laden , but of what her cargo consisted was not known .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 42]: In this vessel they found two men in the cabin playing cards , whom they seized and bound and , cutting her cables , were obliged to make sail upon her , as she was much too large to sweep out .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 19]: As they were making sail they , however , met with an interruption which they did not expect .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 85]: The crew belonging to the vessel , having had enough amusement for the evening , and intending to sail the next morning , had thought it right to come off sooner than the others : it was then about midnight or a little later , and while some of Jack 's men were aloft , for he had six with him , Jack , to his annoyance , heard a boat coming off from the shore , the men in her singing a chorus .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 46]: The galliot was at that time just under steerage way , her topsails had been loosed and her jib hoisted , but the former had not been sheeted home , for the three men below could not , in the dark , find the ropes .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 58]: The other three men were on the fore-yard loosing the foresail , and Jack was undetermined whether to call them down immediately , or to allow them to loose the sail , and thus get good way on the vessel , so as to prevent the boat , which was loaded with men , from overtaking them .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 34]: The boat was not more than twenty yards from the galliot , when , not finding her where they left her , they pulled to the right , and lay on their oars .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 15]: This gave a moment of time , but they very soon spied her out .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 4]: `` Caramba ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 14]: was the exclamation -- and the head of the boat was pulled round .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 17]: `` Down , my lads , in a moment by the swifters , '' cried Jack .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 11]: `` Here 's a boat on board of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 25]: The men were in a few seconds on deck , and the others , who had now sheeted home the topsails , hastened aft .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 44]: The vessel soon gathered way , but before that her way was sufficient , the boat had pulled under the counter , and the Spaniards , letting their oars swing fore and aft , were climbing up , their knives in their teeth .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 17]: A scuffle ensued , and they were thrown down again , but they renewed their attempt .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 46]: Our hero , perceiving a small water or wine cask lashed to the gunwale , cut it loose with his cutlass , and with one of the men , who was by his side , pushed it over , and dropped it into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 48]: It struck the gunwale , stove a plank , and the boat began to fill rapidly ; in the meantime the galliot had gained way -- the boat could not longer be held on , from its weight , and dropped astern with the men in it .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 33]: Those who were half in and half out were left clinging to the gunwale of the vessel , and as they climbed up were secured , and put down in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 72]: Fortunately , no fire-arms having been used on either side , the alarm was not given generally , but the sentry reported fighting on board one of the vessels , and the people of the guard-boat were collected , and pulled out ; but they only arrived in time to see that the galliot was under way , and that the two other vessels from Valparaiso were not in their berths .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 82]: They hastened on shore , gave the alarm : the gun-boats , of which there were three at the mole , were ordered out , but half the crew and all the officers were on shore , some at balls , others drinking at taverns or posadas ; before they could be collected , all three vessels were alongside of the Rebiera : and not aware that anything had been discovered , our hero and his crew were lulled in security .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 54]: Jack had gone on board , leaving fourteen of his men on board the galliot -- Gascoigne had done the same -- Mesty still remained on board his vessel ; and they were congratulating themselves , and ordering the men on board to the windlass , when they heard the sound of oars .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 3]: `` Silence !
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 6]: -- what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 3]: exclaimed Oxbelly .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 14]: `` The gun-boats or row-boats , as sure as I 'm alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 9]: At this moment Mesty jumped up the side .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 12]: `` Massa Easy , I hear row-boat not far off . ''
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 7]: `` So do we , Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 39]: Gascoigne , jump into the boat -- tell the men in the prizes to make all sail right out , and leave us to defend their retreat -- stay on board of one and divide your men . ''
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 8]: `` Dat all right , Massa Easy .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 24]: Mr Gascoigne , be smart -- and now , sar , cut cable and make sail ; no time get up anchor . ''
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 51]: This order was given , but although the men were aloft in a moment , and very expeditious , as the Rebiera payed her head round and the jib was hoisted , they could perceive the boom of the three gun-boats pulling and sailing not five cables length from them .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 36]: Although rather short-handed , topsails , courses and top-gallant sails were soon set , the men down to their quarters , and the guns cast loose , before the gun-boats were close under their stern .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 18]: Then Jack rounded to , braced up , and the Rebiera stood across them to the westward .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 10]: `` Why the devil do n't they fire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 3]: said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 13]: `` I tink because they no ab powder , '' said Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 53]: Mesty was right -- the ammunition chests of the gun-boats were always landed when they were at the mole , in case of accidents , which might arise from the crew being continually with cigars in their mouths , and in the hurry they had quite forgotten to put them on board .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 21]: `` At all events , we have powder , '' said Jack , `` and now we 'll prove it .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 13]: Grape and canister , my lads , and take good aim . ''
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 33]: The commanders of the gun-boats had hailed each other , and agreed to board the Rebiera , but she now had good way on her , and sailed faster than they pulled .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 60]: A well-directed broadside astonished them -- they had no idea of her force ; and the execution done was so great , that they first lay on their oars and then pulled back to the mole with all speed , leaving the Rebiera in quiet possession of her prizes , which had already gained two miles in the offing .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 40]: The Rebiera , as soon as Jack perceived that the gun-boats had retreated , was put before the wind , and soon closed with her captures , when she was hove-to till daylight with the three vessels in company .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 25]: Gascoigne returned on board , prize-masters were selected , and Jack determined to keep them all with him , and take them to Palermo .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 18]: CHAPTER XL In which there is another slight difference of opinion between those who should be friends .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 19]: The two lateen vessels proved of considerable value , being laden with copper , hides , and cochineal .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 14]: The galliot was laden with sweet-oil , and was also no despicable prize .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 27]: At daylight they were all ready , and , to the mortification of the good people of Malaga , sailed away to the eastward without interruption .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 24]: `` Me tink we do dat job pretty well , Massa Easy , '' observed Mesty , as he laid the breakfast table .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 30]: `` Nothing like trying , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` I 'm sure when we stood into the bay I would have sold all my prize-money for a doubloon .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 8]: How do I share , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 31]: `` Only as one of the crew , Ned , for you are a supernumerary , and our articles and agreement for prize-money were signed previous to our sailing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 17]: `` I ought to share with Mr Oxbelly 's class by rights , '' replied Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 11]: `` That would be to take half my prize-money away .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 20]: I shall want it all , Mr Gascoigne , to pacify my wife for giving her the slip . ''
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 14]: `` Ah , very well ; I 'll get all I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 28]: For ten days they ran down the coast , going much too fast for the wishes of the crew , who were anxious to make more money .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 35]: They seized a fishing-boat and put on board of her the four prisoners , which they had found in the vessels , and arrived off Barcelona , without falling in with friend or foe .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 34]: The next morning , the wind being very light , they discovered a large vessel at daylight astern of them to the westward , and soon made her out to be a frigate .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 26]: She made all sail in chase , but that gave them very little uneasiness , as they felt assured that she was a British cruiser .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 27]: One fear , however , came over them , that she would , if she came up with them , impress a portion of their men .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 47]: `` As certain as I 'm here , and Mrs Oxbelly 's at Southsea , '' said Oxbelly , `` they 'll take some of the men -- the more so as , supposing us to be a Spanish convoy , they will be disappointed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 15]: `` They will hardly take them out of the prizes , '' observed Easy .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 18]: `` I do n't know that ; men must be had for his Majesty 's service somehow .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 26]: It 's not their fault , Mr Easy -- the navy must be manned , and as things are so , so things must be .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 24]: It 's the king 's prerogative , Mr Easy , and we can not fight the battles of the country without it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 58]: `` Yes , '' replied Gascoigne , `` and although , as soon as the services of seamen are no longer wanted , you find that there are demagogues on shore who exclaim against impressment , they are quiet enough on the point when they know that their lives and property depend upon sailors ' exertions . ''
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 40]: `` Very true , Mr Gascoigne , but it 's not our fault if we are obliged to take men by force ; it 's the fault of those who do not legislate so as to prevent the necessity .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 21]: Mrs Oxbelly used to say that she would easily manage the matter if she were Chancellor of the Exchequer . ''
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 63]: `` I dare say Mrs Oxbelly would make a very good Chancellor of the Exchequer , '' replied Gascoigne , smiling ; `` one thing is certain , that if they gave the subject half the consideration they have others of less magnitude , an arrangement might be made by which his Majesty 's navy would never be short of men . ''
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 25]: `` No doubt , no doubt , Mr Gascoigne ; but , nevertheless , the king 's prerogative must never be given up . ''
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 24]: `` There I agree with you , Mr Oxbelly ; it must be held in case of sudden emergency and absolute need . ''
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 22]: `` We 'll argue that point by-and-bye , '' replied Jack ; `` now let us consult as to our measures .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 26]: My opinion is , that if I made more sail we should beat the frigate , but she would come up with the prizes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 47]: `` That 's the best thing we can do , Mr Easy ; but let us send a boat on board of them , and take out all the men that can possibly be spared , that there may be no excuse for impressing them . ''
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 41]: `` Yes , '' replied Gascoigne ; `` and as the wind is falling it is possible it may fall calm , and they may send their boats ; suppose we separate a mile or two from each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 13]: `` Dat very good advice , Massa Gascoigne , '' observed Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 51]: This plan was acted upon ; only three men were left in the lateens , and four in the galliot , and the vessels , in obedience to the orders , sheered off on both sides of the Rebiera , who made all sail and started ahead of the prizes .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 24]: This manoeuvre was perceived on board of the frigate , and made them sure that it was a Spanish convoy attempting to escape .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 18]: The fire-engine was got on deck , sails wetted , and every exertion made to come up .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 47]: But about four o'clock in the afternoon , when the frigate was eight or nine miles off , it fell calm , as Gascoigne had predicted , and the heads of all the vessels , as well as the frigate , were now round the compass .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 25]: `` There 's out boats , '' said Mr Oxbelly ; `` they will have a long pull , and all for nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 8]: `` How savage they will be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 3]: observed Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 18]: `` Never mind that , '' replied Jack ; `` Mesty says that dinner is ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 31]: After dinner , they all went on deck , and found that the boats had separated , one pulling for each of the prizes , and two for the Rebiera .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 12]: In less than an hour , they would probably be alongside .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 12]: `` And now let us decide how we are to act .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 14]: We must not resist , if they attempt to impress the men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 36]: `` I 've been thinking upon that matter , Mr Easy , and it appears to me that the men must be permitted to act as they please , and that we must be neuter .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 22]: I , as a lieutenant in his Majesty 's service , can not of course act , neither can Mr Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 17]: You are not in the service , but I should recommend you to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 28]: That the men have a right to resist , if possible , is admitted ; they always do so , and never are punished for so doing .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 40]: Under the guns of the frigate , of course we should only have to submit ; but those two boats do not contain more than twenty-five men , I should think , and our men are the stronger party .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 13]: We had better leave it to them , and stand neuter . ''
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 30]: `` Dat very good advice , '' said Mesty ; `` leab it to us '' : and Mesty walked away forward where the seamen were already in consultation .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 30]: Jack also agreed to the prudence of this measure , and he perceived that the seamen , after a consultation with Mesty , were all arming themselves for resistance .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 17]: The boats were now close on board , and English colours were hoisted at the gaff .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 49]: This did not , however , check the impetus of the boats , who , with their ensigns trailing in the still water astern of them , dashed alongside , and an officer leaped on board , cutlass in hand , followed by the seamen of the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 17]: The men of the Rebiera remained collected forward -- Easy , Gascoigne , and Oxbelly aft .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 7]: `` What vessel is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 8]: cried the lieutenant who commanded the boats .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 34]: Jack , with the greatest politeness , took off his hat , and told him that it was the Rebiera letter of marque , and that the papers were ready for his inspection .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 7]: `` And the other vessels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 16]: `` Prizes to the Rebiera , cut out of Malaga Bay , '' replied Jack .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 13]: `` Then you are a privateer , '' observed the disappointed officer .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 7]: `` Where are your papers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 15]: `` Mr Oxbelly , oblige me by bringing them up , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 17]: `` Fat Jack of the bone house , '' observed the lieutenant , looking at Oxbelly .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 49]: `` A lieutenant in his Majesty 's service , of longer standing than yourself , young man , '' replied Oxbelly , firmly ; -- `` and who , if he ever meets you in any other situation , will make you answer for your insolent remark . ''
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 22]: observed the lieutenant , ironically ; `` now , if you had said you were once a boatswain or gunner . ''
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 13]: `` Consider yourself kicked , '' roared Oxbelly , losing his temper .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 3]: `` Heyday !
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 7]: why , you old porpoise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 40]: `` Sir , '' observed Jack , who listened with indignation , `` Mr Oxbelly is a lieutenant in his Majesty 's service , and you have no right to insult him , even if he were not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 13]: `` I presume you are all officers , '' replied the lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 35]: `` I am , sir , '' retorted Gascoigne , `` an officer in his Majesty 's service , and on board of this vessel by permission of Captain Sawbridge of the Latona . ''
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 35]: `` And I was , until a few months ago , sir , '' continued Jack ; `` at present I am captain and owner of this vessel -- but here are the papers .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 44]: You will have no obstruction from us in the execution of your duty -- at the same time , I call upon the two young gentlemen by your side , and your own men , to bear witness to what takes place . ''
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 12]: `` O very well , sir -- just as you please .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 10]: Your papers , I perceive , are all right .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 11]: Now you will oblige me by mustering your men . ''
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 22]: `` Certainly , sir , '' replied Jack : `` send all the men aft to muster , Mr Oxbelly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 20]: The men came aft to the mainmast , with Mesty at their head , and answered to their names .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 45]: As the men passed over , the lieutenant made a pencil-mark against ten of them , who appeared the finest seamen ; and , when the roll had been called , he ordered those men to get their bags and go into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 51]: `` Sir , as you must observe , I am short-handed , with my men away in prizes ; and I , as commander of this vessel , protest against this proceeding : if you insist upon taking them , of course I can do nothing , '' observed Jack .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 20]: `` I do insist , sir ; I 'm not going on board empty-handed , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 29]: `` Well , sir , I can say no more , '' said Jack , walking aft to the taffrail , to which Oxbelly and Gascoigne had retreated .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 18]: `` Come , my lads , get those men in the boat , '' said the lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 22]: But the men had all retreated forward in a body , with Mesty at their head , and had armed themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 35]: Some of the seamen of the frigate had gone forward , in obedience to their officer , to lead the men selected into the boat ; but they were immediately desired to keep back .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 21]: The scuffle forward attracted the notice of the lieutenant , who immediately summoned all his men out of the boats .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 6]: `` Mutiny , by heavens !
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 10]: Come up all of you , my lads . ''
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 66]: Mesty then came forward , with a sabre in one hand and a pistol in the other , and then addressed the seamen of the frigate : -- `` I tell you dis , my lads -- you not so strong as we -- you not got better arms -- we not under gun of frigate now , and ab determination not to go board .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 15]: ` Pose you want us , come take us -- ` pose you can .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 15]: By all de power , but we make mince-meat of you , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 40]: The seamen paused -- they were ready to fight for their country , but not to be killed by or kill those who were their own countrymen , and who were doing exactly what they would have done themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 12]: The lieutenant thought otherwise ; he was exasperated at this sensation .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 28]: `` You black scoundrel , I left you out because I thought you not worth having , but now I 'll add you to the number . ''
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 9]: `` Stop a little , '' replied Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 39]: The lieutenant would not take the Ashantee 's very prudent advice ; he flew forward to seize Mesty , who , striking him a blow with the flat of his sabre , almost levelled him to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 34]: At this the men and other officers of the frigate darted forward ; but after a short scuffle , in which a few wounds were received , were beaten back into the boats .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 40]: The lieutenant was thrown in after them , by the nervous arm of Mesty -- and assailed by cold shot and other missiles , they sheered off with precipitation , and pulled back in the direction of the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 24]: `` There will be a row about this , '' said Oxbelly , `` as soon as they come clear of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 14]: If the frigate gets hold of us she will show us no mercy .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 9]: There is a breeze coming from the north-west .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 3]: How fortunate !
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 13]: we shall be three leagues to windward , and may escape . ''
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 9]: `` I doubt if she could catch us .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 21]: At any point of sailing they may come up with the prizes , but can do nothing with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 41]: `` No , the boats which boarded them are already returned to the frigate ; she must wait for them , and that will give us a start , and it will be night before they can make sail . ''
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 37]: `` Fire a gun for the prizes to close , '' said Jack ; `` we will put the men on board again , and then be off to Palermo as fast as we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 11]: `` We can do no better , '' said Oxbelly .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 20]: `` If ever I chance to meet that fellow again , I will trouble him to repeat his words .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 8]: Trim the sails , my lads . ''
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 10]: `` His language was unpardonable , '' observed Jack .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 92]: `` Since I 've been in the service , Mr Easy , I have always observed that some officers appear to imagine , that because they are under the king 's pennant , they are warranted in insulting and tyrannising over all those who have not the honour to hoist it ; whereas , the very fact of their being king 's officers should be an inducement to them to show an example of courtesy and gentlemanly conduct in the execution of their duty , however unpleasant it may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 28]: `` It is only those who , insignificant themselves , want to make themselves of importance by the pennant they serve under , '' replied our hero .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 35]: `` Very true , Mr Easy ; but you are not aware that a great part of the ill-will shown to the service is owing to the insolence of those young men in office .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 16]: The king 's name is a warrant for every species of tyranny and unwarrantable conduct .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 50]: I remember Mrs Oxbelly telling one of them , when -- '' `` I beg your pardon , Mr Oxbelly , '' interrupted Jack , `` but we have no time to chat now ; the breeze is coming down fast , and I perceive the prizes are closing .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 34]: Let us lower down the boat , send the men on board again , and give them their orders -- which I will do in writing , in case they part company . ''
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 6]: `` Very true , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 29]: It will be dark in half an hour , and as we are now standing in-shore , they will think that we intend to remain on the coast .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 15]: As soon as it is quite dark we will shape our course for Palermo .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 11]: I will go down and look at the chart . ''
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 13]: CHAPTER XLI Which winds up the nautical adventures of Mr Midshipman Easy .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 22]: In half an hour the prizes were again alongside , the men put on board , and the boat hoisted up .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 14]: The frigate still remained becalmed to leeward , and hoisted in her boats .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 32]: They watched until she was hid by the shades of night , and then wearing round stood away , with the wind two points free , for the coast of Sicily .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 13]: The next morning when the sun rose there was nothing in sight .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 25]: Strange anomaly , in a state of high civilisation , where you find your own countrymen avoided and more dreaded than even your foes !
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 18]: The run was prosperous , the weather was fine , and the prizes did not part company .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 14]: On the sixteenth day the Rebiera and her convoy anchored in Palermo Bay .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 56]: The wind was light in the morning that they stood in , and as Jack had a large blue flag with Rebiera in white letters hoisted at the main , Don Philip and Don Martin were on board and greeting our hero , before the Rebiera 's anchor had plunged into the clear blue water .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 23]: The information which our hero received , after having been assured of the health of Agnes and her parents , was satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 58]: The disappearance of the friar had , at first , occasioned much surprise ; but as the servants of Don Rebiera swore to his return without the black , and the letter of Don Rebiera , sent to the convent , requesting his presence , was opened and read , there was no suspicion against the family .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 54]: A hundred conjectures had been afloat , but gradually they had subsided , and it was at last supposed that he had been carried off by the banditti , some of whom had been taken , and acknowledged that they had seized a friar , on a day which they could not recollect .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 9]: The reader will remember that it was Mesty .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 40]: The Rebiera received pratique , and Jack hastened on shore with Don Philip and his brother , and was once more in company of Agnes , who , in our hero 's opinion , had improved since his departure .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 19]: Most young men in love think the same after an absence , provided it is not too long .
