Parsing [sent. 1 len. 11]: Diary in America -- Series One , by Captain Marryat .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 37]: In the late 1830s Captain Marryat , already a famous literary figure in North America , visited the United States and Canada , writing his observations in two Series of volumes , each containing three books .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 37]: These were published in Britain as the six books , but were published in America as two books with small print and thin paper , thus enabling the Diary to be published as two books only .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 28]: It is from first editions of the American version that we have worked , though we do possess three of the British first edition of six volumes .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 33]: While some of the observations are trivial , and some even possibly misleading , there is a great deal of useful fact in these books , making them well worth looking at .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 17]: There are some tables that may not reproduce well in the PDA version of these books .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 22]: Marryat used his knowledge of America to write a novel based in the more southerly part , especially California and Texas .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 11]: DIARY IN AMERICA -- SERIES ONE , BY CAPTAIN MARRYAT .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 6]: Volume the First -- Introduction .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 45]: After many years of travel , during which I had seen men under almost every variety of government , religion , and climate , I looked round to discover if there were not still new combinations under which human nature was to be investigated .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 48]: I had traversed the old country until satisfied , if not satiated ; and I had sailed many a weary thousand miles from west to east , and from north to south , until people , manners , and customs were looked upon by me with indifference .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 32]: The press was constantly pouring out works upon the new world , so contradictory to each other , and pronounced so unjust by the Americans , that my curiosity was excited .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 40]: It appeared strange to me that travellers whose works showed evident marks of talent should view the same people through such very different mediums ; and that their gleanings should , generally speaking , be of such meagre materials .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 61]: Was there so little to be remarked about America , its government , its institutions , and the effect which these had upon the people , that the pages of so many writers upon that country should be filled up with how the Americans dined or drank wine , and what description of spoons and forks were used at table ?
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 39]: Either the Americans remained purely and unchangedly English , as when they left their father-land ; or the question required more investigation and deeper research than travellers in their hasty movements have been able to bestow upon it .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 38]: Whether I should be capable of throwing any new light upon the subject , I knew not , but at all events I made up my mind that I would visit the country and judge for myself .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 45]: On my first arrival I perceived little difference between the city of New York and one of our principal provincial towns ; and , for its people , not half so much as between the people of Devonshire or Cornwall and those of Middlesex .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 35]: I had been two or three weeks in that city , and I said : There is certainly not much to write about , nor much more than what has already been continually repeated .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 17]: No wonder that those who preceded me have indulged in puerilities to swell out their books .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 93]: But in a short time I altered my opinion : even at New York , the English appearance of the people gradually wore away ; my perception of character became more keen , my observance consequently more nice and close , and I found that there was a great deal to reflect upon and investigate , and that America and the American people were indeed an enigma ; and I was no longer surprised at the incongruities which were to be detected in those works which had attempted to describe the country .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 44]: I do not assert that I shall myself succeed , when so many have failed , but at any rate , this I am certain of , my remarks will be based upon a more sure foundation -- an analysis of human nature .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 142]: There are many causes why those who have written upon America have fallen into error : they have represented the Americans as a nation : now they are not yet , nor will they for many years be , in the true sense of the word , a nation -- they are a mass of many people cemented together to a certain degree , by a general form of government ; but they are in a state of transition , and -LRB- what may at first appear strange -RRB- no amalgamation as has yet taken place : the puritan of the east , the Dutch descent of the middle states , the cavalier of the south , are nearly as marked and distinct now , as at the first occupation of the country , softened down indeed , but still distinct .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 49]: Not only are the populations of the various states distinct , but even those of the cities : and it is hardly possible to make a remark which may be considered as general to a country , where the varieties of soil and of climate are so extensive .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 59]: Even on that point upon which you might most safely venture to generalise , namely , the effect of a democratical form of government upon the mass , your observations must be taken with some exceptions , arising from the climate , manners , and customs , and the means of livelihood so differing in this extended country .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 37]: Indeed the habit in which travellers indulge of repeating facts which have taken place , of having taken place in America , has , perhaps unintentionally on their part , very much misled the English reader .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 119]: It would hardly be considered fair , if the wilder parts of Ireland , and the disgraceful acts which are committed there , were represented as characteristic of England , or the British empire ; yet between London and Connaught there is less difference than between the most civilised and intellectual portion of America , such as Boston and Philadelphia , and the wild regions , and wilder inhabitants of the west of the Mississippi , and Arkansas , where reckless beings compose a scattered population , residing too far for the law to reach ; or where if it could reach , the power of the government would prove much too weak to enforce obedience to it .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 56]: To do justice to all parties , America should be examined and portrayed piecemeal , every state separately , for every state is different , running down the scale from refinement to a state of barbarism almost unprecedented ; but each presenting matter for investigation and research , and curious examples of cause and effect .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 24]: Many of those who have preceded me have not been able to devote sufficient time to their object , and therefore have failed .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 118]: If you have passed through a strange country , totally differing in manners , and customs , and language from your own , you may give your readers some idea of the contrast , and the impressions made upon you by what you saw , even if you have travelled in haste or sojourned there but a few days ; but when the similarity in manners , customs , and language is so great , that you may imagine yourself to be in your own country , it requires more research , a greater degree of acumen , and a fuller investigation of cause and effect than can be given in a few months of rapid motion .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 51]: Moreover , English travellers have apparently been more active in examining the interior of houses , than the public path from which they should have drawn their conclusions ; they have searched with the curiosity of a woman , instead of examining and surveying with the eye of a philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 30]: Following up this wrong track has been the occasion of much indiscretion and injustice on their parts , and of justifiably indignant feeling on the part of the Americans .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 64]: By many of the writers on America , the little discrepancies , the mere trifles of custom have been dwelt upon , with a sarcastic , ill-natured severity to give their works that semblance of pith , in which , in reality , they were miserably deficient ; and they violated the rights of hospitality that they might increase their interest as authors .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 37]: The Americans are often themselves the cause of their being misrepresented ; there is no country perhaps , in which the habit of deceiving for amusement , or what is termed hoaxing , is so common .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 13]: Indeed this and the hyperbole constitute the major part of American humour .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 87]: If they have the slightest suspicion that a foreigner is about to write a book , nothing appears to give them so much pleasure as to try to mislead him ; this has constantly been practised upon me , and for all I know , they may in some instances have been successful ; if they have , all I can say of the story is that '' _ se non e vero , e si ben trovato _ , '' that it might have happened .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 5]: -LSB- Note 1 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 52]: When I was at Boston , a gentleman of my acquaintance brought me Miss Martineau 's work , and was excessively delighted when he pointed out to me two pages of fallacies , which he had told her with a grave face , and which she had duly recorded and printed .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 66]: This practice , added to another , that of attempting to conceal -LRB- for the Americans are aware of many of their defects -RRB- , has been with me productive of good results : it has led me to much close investigation , and has made me very cautious in asserting what has not been proved to my own satisfaction to be worthy of credibility .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 27]: Another difficulty and cause of misrepresentation is , that travellers are not aware of the jealousy existing between the inhabitants of the different states and cities .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 42]: The eastern states pronounce the southerners to be choleric , reckless , regardless of law , and indifferent as to religion ; while the southerners designate the eastern states as a nursery of overreaching pedlars , selling clocks and wooden nutmegs .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 17]: This running into extremes is produced from the clashing of their interests as producers and manufacturers .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 52]: Again , Boston turns up her erudite nose at New York ; Philadelphia , in her pride , looks down upon both New York and Boston ; while New York , clinking her dollars , swears the Bostonians are a parcel of puritanical prigs , and the Philadelphians a would-be aristocracy .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 32]: A western man from Kentucky , when at the Tremont House in Boston , begged me particularly not to pay attention to what they said of his state in that quarter .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 16]: Both a Virginian and Tennessean , when I was at New York did the same .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 11]: At Boston , I was drinking champaign at a supper .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 7]: `` Are you drinking champaign ? ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 5]: said a young Bostonian .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 41]: `` That 's New York -- take claret ; or , if you will drink champaign , pour it into a _ green _ glass , and they will think it _ hock _ ; champaign is not right . ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 14]: How are we to distinguish between right and wrong in this queer world ?
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 22]: At New York , they do drink a great deal of champaign ; it is the small beer of the dinner-table .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 15]: Champaign become associated with New York , and therefore is not _ right _ .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 40]: I will do the New Yorkers the justice to say , that , as far as _ drinks _ are concerned , they are above prejudice : all 's right with them , provided there 's enough of it .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 33]: The above remarks will testify , that travellers in America have great difficulties to contend with , and that their channels of information have been chiefly those of the drawing-room or dinner-table .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 44]: Had I worked through the same , I should have found then very difficult of access ; for the Americans had determined that they would no longer extend their hospitality to those who returned it with ingratitude -- nor can they be blamed .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 6]: Let us reverse the case .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 37]: Were not the doors of many houses in England shut against an American author , when from his want of knowledge of conventional _ usage _ , he published what never should have appeared in print !
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 28]: And should another return to England , after his tetchy , absurd remarks upon the English , is there much chance of his receiving a kind welcome ?
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 13]: Most assuredly not ; both these authors will be received with caution .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 41]: The Americans , therefore , are not only not to blame , but would prove themselves very deficient in a proper respect for themselves , if they again admitted into their domestic circles those who eventually requited them with abuse .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 58]: Admitting this , of course I have no feelings of ill-will toward them for any want of hospitality toward me ; on the contrary , I was pleased with the neglect , as it left me free , and unshackled from any real or fancied claims which the Americans might have made upon me on that score .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 27]: Indeed , I had not been three weeks in the country before I decided upon accepting no more invitations , even charily as they were made .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 39]: I found that , although invited , my presence was a restraint upon the company ; every one appeared afraid to speak ; and when anything ludicrous occurred , the cry would be -- `` Oh , now .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 12]: Captain Marryat , do n't put that into your book . ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 74]: More than once , when I happened to be in large parties , a question such as follows would be put to me by some `` free and enlightened individual '' : -- `` Now , Captain Marryat , I ask you before this company , and I trust you will give me a categorical answer , Are you , or are you not about to write a book upon this country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 51]: I hardly need observe to the English reader , that , under such circumstances , the restraint , became mutual ; I declined all farther invitations , and adhered to this determination as far as I could without cause of offence , during my whole tour through the United States .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 49]: But if I admit , that after the usage which they had received , the Americans are justified in not again tendering their hospitably to the English , I can not , at the same time , but express my opinion as to their conduct toward me personally .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 140]: They had no right to insult and annoy me in the manner they did , from nearly one end of the Union to the other , either because my predecessors had expressed an unfavourable opinion of them before my arrival , or because they expected that I would do the same upon my return to my own country , I remark upon this conduct , not from any feeling of ill-will or desire of retaliation , but to compel the Americans to admit that I am under no obligations to them : that I received from them much more of insult and outrage than of kindness ; and , consequently , that the charge of ingratitude can not be laid to my door , however offensive to them some of the remarks in this work may happen to be .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 28]: And here I must observe , that the Americans can no longer anticipate lenity from the English traveller , as latterly they have so deeply committed themselves .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 36]: Once , indeed , they could say , `` We admit and are hospitable to the English , who , as soon as they leave our country , turn round and abuse and revile us .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 22]: We have our faults , it is true : but such conduct on their part is not kind or generous . ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 23]: But they can say this no longer ; they have retaliated , and in their attacks they have been regardless of justice .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 60]: The three last works upon the Americans , written by English authors , were , on the whole , favourable to them ; Mr Power 's and Mr Grund 's most decidedly so ; and Miss Martineau 's , filled as it is with absurdities and fallacies , was _ intended _ , at all events to be favourable .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 233]: In opposition to them , we have Mr Cooper 's remarks upon England , in which my countrymen are certainly not spared ; and , since that publication , we have another of much greater importance , written by Mr Carey , of Philadelphia , not , indeed , in a strain of vituperation or ill-feeling , but asserting , and no doubt to his own satisfaction and that of his countrymen , proving , that in every important point , that is to say , under the heads of `` Security of Person and Property , of Morals , Education , Religion , Industry , Invention , Credit , '' -LRB- and consequently Honesty , -RRB- America is in advance of England and every other nation in Europe !! The tables , then , are turned ; it is no longer the English , but the Americans who are the assailants ; and such being the case , I beg that it may be remembered , that many of the remarks which will subsequently appear in this work have been forced from me by the attacks made upon my nation by the American authors ; and that , if I am compelled to draw comparisons , it is not with the slightest wish to annoy or humiliate the Americans , but in legitimate and justifiable defence of my own native land .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 55]: America is a wonderful country , endowed by the Omnipotent with natural advantages which no other can boast of ; and the mind can hardly calculate upon the degree of perfection and power to which , whether the states are eventually separated or not , it may in the course of two centuries arrive .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 63]: At present all is energy and enterprise ; everything is in a state of transition , but of rapid improvement -- so rapid , indeed , that those who would describe America now , would have to correct all in the short space of ten years ; for ten years in America is almost equal to a century in the old continent .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 65]: Now , you may pass through a wild forest , where the elk browses and the panther howls ; in ten years , that very forest , with its denizens , will , most likely , have disappeared , and in their place you will find towns with thousands of inhabitants ; with arts , manufactures , and machinery , all in full activity .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 30]: In reviewing America , we must look upon it as showing the development of the English character under a new aspect , arising from a new state of things .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 45]: If I were to draw a comparison between the English and the Americans , I should say that there is almost as much difference between the two nations at this present time , as there has long been between the English and the Dutch .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 25]: The latter are considered by us as phlegmatic and slow ; and we may be considered the same , compared with our energetic descendants .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 22]: Time to an American is everything , -LSB- Note 2 -RSB- and space he attempts to reduce to a mere nothing .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 38]: By the steamboats , rail-roads , and the wonderful facilities of water-carriage , a journey of five hundred miles is as little considered in America , as would be here a journey from London to Brighton . ''
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 28]: _ Go ahead _ '' is the real motto of the country ; and every man does push on , to gain in advance of his neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 22]: The American lives twice as long as others ; for he does twice the work during the time that he lives .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 27]: He begins life sooner : at fifteen he is considered a man , plunges into the stream of enterprise , floats and struggles with his fellows .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 13]: In every trifle an American shows the value he puts upon time .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 23]: He rises early , eats his meals with the rapidity of a wolf , and is the whole day at his business .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 48]: If he be a merchant , his money , whatever it may amount to , is seldom invested ; it is all floating -- his accumulations remain active ; and when he dies , his wealth has to be collected from the four quarters of the globe .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 26]: Now , all this energy and activity is of English origin ; and were England expanded into America , the same results would be produced .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 66]: To a certain degree , the English , were in former times , what the Americans are now ; and this it is which has raised our country so high in the scale of nations ; but since we have become so closely packed -- so crowded , that there is hardly room for the population , our activity has been proportionably cramped and subdued .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 27]: But , in this vast and favoured country , the very associations and impressions of childhood foster and enlighten the intellect and precociously rouse the energies .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 43]: The wide expanse of territory already occupied -- the vast and magnificent rivers -- the boundless regions yet remaining to be peopled -- the rapidity of communication -- the dispatch with which everything is effected , are evident almost to the child .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 58]: To those who have rivers many thousand miles in length , the passage across the Atlantic -LRB- of 3,500 miles -RRB- appears but a trifle ; and the American ladies talk of spending the winter at Paris with as much indifference as one of our landed proprietors would , of going up to London for the season .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 45]: We must always bear in mind the peculiar and wonderful advantages of _ country _ , when we examine America and its form of government ; for the country has had more to do with upholding this democracy than people might at first imagine .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 47]: Among the advantages of democracy , the greatest is , perhaps , that _ all start fair _ ; and the boy who holds the traveller 's horse , as Van Buren is said to have done , may become the president of the United States .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 28]: But it is the _ country _ , and not the government ; which has been productive of such rapid strides as have been made by America .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 42]: Indeed it is a query whether the form of government would have existed down to this day , had it not been for the advantages derived from the vast extent and boundless resources of the territory in which it was established .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 29]: Let the American direct his career to any goal he pleases , his energies are unshackled ; and , in the race , the best man must win .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 10]: There is room for all , and millions more .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 25]: Let him choose his profession -- his career is not checked or foiled by the excess of those who have already embarked in it .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 24]: In every department there is an opening for talent ; and for those inclined to work , work is always to be procured .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 27]: You have no complaint in this country , that every profession is so full that it is impossible to know what to do with your children .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 17]: There is a vast field , and all may receive the reward due for their labour .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 33]: In a country where the ambition and energies of man have been roused to such an extent , the great point is to find out worthy incitements for ambition to feed upon .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 29]: A virtue undirected into a wrong channel may , by circumstances , prove little better than -LRB- even if it does not sink down into -RRB- actual vice .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 16]: Hence it is that a democratic form of government is productive of such demoralising effects .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 5]: Its rewards are few .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 23]: Honours of every description , which stir up the soul of man to noble deeds -- worthy incitements , they have none .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 47]: The only compensation they can offer for services is money ; and the only distinction -- the only means of raising himself above his fellows left to the American -- is wealth ; consequently , the acquisition of wealth has become the great spring of action .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 19]: But it is not sought after with the avarice to hoard , but with the ostentation to expend .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 12]: It is the effect of ambition directed into a wrong channel .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 39]: Each man would surpass his neighbour ; and the only great avenue open to all , and into which thousands may press without much jostling of each other , is that which leads to the shrine of Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 35]: It is our nature to attempt to raise ourselves above our fellow-men ; it is the main-spring of existence -- the incitement to all that is great and virtuous , or great and vicious .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 63]: In America , but a small portion can raise themselves , or find rewards for superior talent , but wealth is attainable by all ; and having no aristocracy , no honours , no distinctions to look forward to , wealth has become the substitute , and , with very few exceptions , every man is great in proportion to his riches .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 25]: The consequence is , that to leave a sum of money when they die is of little importance to the majority of the Americans .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 21]: Their object is to amass it while young , and obtain the consideration which it gives them during their lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 47]: The society in the United States is that which must naturally be expected in a new country where there are few men of leisure , and the majority are working hard to obtain that wealth which almost alone gives importance under a democratic form of government .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 18]: You will find intellectual and gentlemanlike people in America , but they are scattered here and there .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 74]: The circle of society is not complete : wherever you go , you will find an admixture , sudden wealth having admitted those who but a few years back were in humble circumstances ; and in the constant state of transition which takes place in this country , it will be half a century , perhaps , before a select circle of society can be collected together in any one city or place .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 23]: The improvement is rapid , but the vast extent of country which has to be peopled prevents that improvement from being manifest .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 36]: The stream flows inland , and those who are here today are gone to-morrow , and their places in society filled up by others who ten years back had no prospect of ever being admitted .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 24]: All is transition , the waves follow one another to the far west , the froth and scum , boiling in the advance .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 13]: America is , indeed , well worth the study of the philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 46]: A vast nation forming , society ever changing , all in motion and activity , nothing complete , the old continent pouring in her surplus to supply the loss of the eastern states , all busy as a hive , full of energy and activity .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 67]: Every year multitudes swarm off from the east , like bees : not the young only , but the old , quitting the close-built cities , society , and refinement , to settle down in some lone spot in the vast prairies , where the rich soil offers to them the certain prospect of their families and children being one day possessed of competency and wealth .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 39]: To write upon America _ as a nation _ would be absurd , for nation , properly speaking , it is not ; but to consider it in its present chaotic state , is well worth the labour .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 43]: It would not only exhibit to the living a somewhat new picture of the human mind , but , as a curious page in the Philosophy of History , it would hereafter serve as a subject of review for the Americans themselves .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 23]: It is not my intention to follow the individualising plans of the majority of those who have preceded me in this country .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 64]: I did not sail across the Atlantic to ascertain whether the Americans eat their dinners with two-prong iron , or three-prong silver forks , with chopsticks , or their fingers ; it is quite sufficient for me to know that they do eat and drink ; if they did not , it would be a curious anomaly which I should not pass over .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 40]: My object was , to examine and ascertain _ what were the effects of a democratic form of government and climate upon a people which , with all its foreign admixture , may still be considered as English _ .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 34]: It is a fact that our virtues and our vices depend more upon circumstances than upon ourselves , and there are no circumstances which operate so powerfully upon us as government and climate .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 27]: Let it not be supposed that , in the above assertion , I mean to extenuate vice , or imply that we are not free agents .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 48]: Naturally prone to vices in general , circumstances will render us more prone to one description of vice than to another ; but that is no reason why we should not be answerable for it , since it is our duty to guard against the besetting sin .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 53]: But as an agent in this point the form of government under which we live is , perhaps , the most powerful in its effects , and thus we constantly hear of vices peculiar to a country , when it ought rather to be said , of vices peculiar to a government .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 21]: Never , perhaps , was the foundation of a nation laid under such peculiarly favourable auspices as that of America .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 13]: The capital they commenced with was industry , activity , and courage .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 119]: They had , moreover , the advantage of the working of genius and wisdom , and the records of history , as a beacon and a guide ; the trial of ages , as to the respective merits of the various governments to which men have submitted ; the power to select the merits from the demerits in each ; a boundless extent of country , rich in everything that could be of advantage to man ; and they were led by those who where really giants in those days , a body of men collected and acting together , forming an aggregate of wisdom and energy , such as probably will not for centuries be seen again .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 39]: Never was there such an opportunity of testing the merits of a republic , of ascertaining if such a form of government could be maintained -- in fact , of proving whether an enlightened people could govern themselves .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 27]: And it must be acknowledged that the work was well begun ; Washington , when his career had closed , left the country a pure republic .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 8]: He did all that man could do .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 29]: Miss Martineau asserts that `` America has solved the great problem , that a republic can exist for fifty years ; '' but such is not the case .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 58]: America has proved that , under peculiar advantages , a people can govern themselves for fifty years ; but if you put the question to an enlightened American , and ask him , `` Were Washington to rise from his grave , would he recognise the present government of America as the one bequeathed to them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 10]: and the American will himself answer in the negative .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 34]: These fifty years have afforded another proof , were it necessary , how short-sighted and fallible are men -- how impossible it is to keep anything in a state of perfection here below .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 48]: Washington left America as an infant nation , a pure and , I may add , a virtuous republic ; but the government of the country has undergone as much change as everything else , and it has now settled down into anything but a pure democracy .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 59]: Nor could it be otherwise ; a republic may be formed and may continue in healthy existence when regulated by a small body of men , but as men increase and multiply so do they deteriorate ; the closer they are packed the more vicious they become , and , consequently , the more vicious become their institutions .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 14]: Washington and his coadjutors had no power to control the nature of man .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 31]: It may be inquired by some , what difference there is between a republic and a democracy , as the terms have been , and are often , used indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 154]: I know not whether my distinction is right , but I consider that when those possessed of most talent and wisdom are selected to act for the benefit of a people , with full reliance upon their acting for the best , and without any shackle or pledge being enforced , we may consider that form of government as a republic ruled by the most enlightened and capable ; but that if , on the contrary , those selected by the people to represent them are not only bound by the pledges previous to their election , but ordered by the mass how to vote after their election , then the country , is not ruled by the collected wisdom of the people , but by the majority , who are as often wrong as right , and then the governing principle sinks into a democracy , as it now is in America .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 5]: -LSB- Note 3 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 25]: It is singular to remark , notwithstanding her monarchical form of government , how much more republican England is in her institutions than America .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 81]: Ask an American what he considers the necessary qualifications of a president , and , after intellectual qualification , he will tell you firmness , decision , and undaunted courage ; and it is really an enigma to him , although he will not acknowledge it , how the sceptre of a country like England , subject to the monarchical sway which he detests , can be held in the hand of a young female of eighteen years of age .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 63]: But upon one point I have made up my mind , which is that , with all its imperfections , democracy is the form of government _ best suited to the present condition of America _ , in so far as it is the one under which the country has made , and will continue to make , the most rapid advances .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 72]: That it must eventually be changed is true , but the times of its change must be determined by so many events , hidden in futurity , which may accelerate or retard the convulsion , that it would be presumptuous for any one to attempt to name a period when the present form of government shall be broken up , and the multitude shall separate and re-embody themselves under new institutions .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 72]: In the arrangement of this work , I have considered it advisable to present , first , to the reader those _ portions _ of my diary which may be interesting , and in which are recorded traits and incidents which will bear strongly upon the commentaries I shall subsequently make upon the institutions of the United States , and the results of those institutions as developed in the American character .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 43]: Having been preceded by so many writers on America , I must occasionally tread in well-beaten tracts ; but , although I shall avoid repetition as much as possible , this will not prevent me from describing what I saw or felt .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 66]: Different ideas , and different associations of ideas , will strike different travellers , as the same landscape may wear a new appearance , according as it is viewed in the morning , by noon , or at night ; the outlines remain the same , but the lights , and shadows , and tints , are reflected from the varying idiosyncrasy of various minds .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 18]: My readers will also find many quotations , either embodied in the work or supplied by notes .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 34]: This I have considered necessary , that my opinions may be corroborated ; but these quotations will not be extracted so much from the works of English as from _ American _ writers .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 49]: The opinions relative to the United States have been so conflicting in the many works which have been written , that I consider it most important that I should be able to quote American authorities against themselves , and strengthen my opinions and arguments by their own admissions .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 4]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note 1 .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 9]: _ Paragraph from a New York paper _ .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 59]: That old , deaf English maiden lady , Miss Martineau , who travelled through some of the states , a few years since , gives a full account of Mr Poindexter 's death ; unfortunately for her veracity , the gentleman still lives ; but this is about as near the truth as the majority of her statements .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 76]: The _ loafing _ English men and women who visit America , as penny-a-liners , are perfectly understood here , and Jonathan amuses himself whenever he meets them , by imposing upon their credulity the most absurd stories which he can invent , which they swallow whole , go home with their eyes sticking out of their heads with wonder , and print all they have heard for the benefit of John Bull 's calves .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 3]: Note 2 .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 50]: The clocks in America -- there rendered so famous by Sam Slick -- instead of the moral lessons inculcated by the dials in this country , such as `` Time flies , '' etcetera , teach one more suited to American feeling : -- `` Time is money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 3]: Note 3 .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 127]: And in this opinion I find that I am borne out by an American writer , who says -- `` It is true , indeed , that the American government , which , as first set up , was properly republican -- that is , representation in a course of salutary degrees , and with salutary checks upon the popular will , on the powers of legislation , of the executive , and the judiciary , -- was assailed at an early period of its history , and has been assailed continuously down to the present time , by a power called democracy , and that this power has been constantly acquiring influence and gaining ascendency in the republic during the term of its history .

Parsing [sent. 168 len. 20]: -- -LRB- _ A Voice from America to England _ , by an American Gentleman , page 10 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 24]: I like to begin at the beginning ; it 's a good old fashion , not sufficiently adhered to in these modern times .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 28]: I recollect a young gentleman who said he was thinking of going to America ; on my asking him , `` how he intended to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 21]: he replied , `` I do n't exactly know ; but I think I shall take the fast coach . ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 22]: I wished him a safe passage , and said , `` I was afraid he would find it very dusty . ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 83]: As I could not find the office to book myself by this young gentleman 's conveyance , I walked down to St Katherine 's Docks ; went on board a packet ; was shewn into a superb cabin , fitted up with bird 's - eye maple , mahogany , and looking-glasses , and communicating with certain small cabins , where there was a sleeping berth for each passenger , about as big as that allowed to a pointer in a dog-kennel .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 24]: I thought that there was more finery than comfort ; but it ended in my promising the captain to meet him at Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 36]: He was to sail from London on the 1st of April , and I did not choose to sail on that day -- it was ominous ; so I embarked at Portsmouth on the 3rd .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 62]: It is not my intention to give a description of crossing the Atlantic ; but as the reader may be disappointed if I do not tell him how I got over , I shall first inform him that we were thirty-eight in the cabin , and 160 men , women , and children , literally stowed in bulk in the steerage .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 35]: I shall describe what took place from the time I first went up the side at Spithead , until the ship was under weigh , and then make a very short passage of it .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 34]: At 9:30 a.m. -- Embarked on board the good ship Quebec ; and a good ship she proved to be , repeatedly going nine and a-half knots on a bowling , sails lifting .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 26]: Captain H -- quite delighted to see me -- all captains of packets are to see passengers : I believed him when he said so .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 3]: At 9:50 .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 12]: -- Sheriff 's officer , as usual , came on board .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 21]: Observed several of the cabin passengers hasten down below , and one who requested the captain to stow him away .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 15]: But it was not a pen-and-ink affair ; it was a case of burglary .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 24]: The officer has found his man in the steerage -- the handcuffs are on his wrists , and they are rowing him ashore .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 22]: His wife and two children are on board ; her lips quiver as she collects her baggage to follow her husband .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 30]: One half-hour more , and he would have escaped from justice , and probably have led a better life in a far country , where his crimes were unknown .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 33]: By the bye , Greenacre , the man who cut the woman up , was taken out of the ship as she went down the river : he had very nearly escaped .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 17]: What cargoes of crime , folly , and recklessness do we yearly ship off to America !
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 10]: America ought to be very much obliged to us .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 35]: The women of the steerage are persuading the wife of the burglar not to go on shore ; their arguments are strong , but not strong enough against the devoted love of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 18]: -- `` Your husband is certain to be hung ; what 's the use of following him ?
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 19]: Your passage is paid , and you will have no difficulty in supporting your children in America . ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 58]: But she rejects the advice -- goes down the side , and presses her children to her breast , as , overcome with the agony of her feelings , she drops into the boat ; and , now that she is away from the ship , you hear the sobs , which can no longer be controlled .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 10]: 10 a.m. -- `` All hands up anchor . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 30]: I was repeating to myself some of the stanzas of Mrs Norton 's `` Here 's a Health to the Outward-bound , '' when I cast my eyes forward .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 26]: I could not imagine what the seamen were about ; they appeared to be _ pumping _ , instead of heaving , at the windlass .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 41]: I forced my way through the heterogeneous mixture of human beings , animals , and baggage which crowded the decks , and discovered that they were working a patent windlass , by Dobbinson -- a very ingenious and superior invention .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 23]: The seamen , as usual , lightened their labour with the song and chorus , forbidden by the etiquette of a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 19]: The one they sung was peculiarly musical , although not refined ; and the chorus of `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 28]: Sally Brown , '' was given with great emphasis by the whole crew between every line of the song , sung by an athletic young third mate .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 17]: I took my seat on the knight-heads -- turned my face aft -- looked and listened .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 8]: `` Heave away there , forward . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 9]: `` Aye , aye , sir . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 6]: ` Sally Brown -- oh !

Parsing [sent. 216 len. 7]: `` Aye , aye , sir .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 12]: Where are we to stow these casks , Mr Fisher ? ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 4]: `` Stow them !
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 12]: Heaven knows ; get them in , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 5]: `` Captain H -- !
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 4]: Captain H -- !
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 19]: there 's my piano still on deck ; it will be quite spoiled -- indeed it will . ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 29]: `` Do n't be alarmed , ma'am ; as soon as we 're under weigh we 'll hoist the cow up , and get the piano down . ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 5]: under the cow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 14]: `` No , ma'am ; but the cow 's over the hatchway . ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 15]: `` Now , then , my lads , forward to the windlass . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 13]: ` I went to town to get some toddy . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 3]: ` Oh !

Parsing [sent. 231 len. 12]: ` T'wasn ' t fit for any body . ' '' ''

Parsing [sent. 234 len. 11]: `` Out there , and clear away the jib . ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 8]: `` Aye , aye , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 12]: `` Mr Fisher , how much cable is there out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 6]: `` Plenty yet , sir .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 9]: -- Heave away , my lads . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 10]: ` Sally is a bright mulattar . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 6]: Sally Brown . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 13]: ` Pretty girl , but ca n't get at her . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 14]: `` Avast heaving ; send the men aft to whip the ladies in .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 24]: -- Now , miss , only sit down and do n't be afraid , and you 'll be in , in no time .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 18]: -- Whip away , my lads , handsomely ; steady her with the guy ; lower away .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 14]: -- There , miss , now you 're safely _ landed _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 5]: `` Landed am I ?
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 9]: I thought I was _ shipped _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 22]: `` Very good , indeed -- very good , miss ; you 'll make an excellent sailor , I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 20]: `` I should make a better sailor 's _ wife _ , I expect , Captain H -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 3]: `` Excellent !
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 12]: Allow me to hand you aft ; you 'll excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 12]: -- Forward now , my men ; heave away ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 10]: ` Seven years I courted Sally . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 6]: Sally Brown . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 9]: ` Seven more of shilley-shally . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 6]: Sally Brown . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 12]: ` She wo n't wed -- ' '' `` Avast heaving .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 13]: Up there , and loose the topsails ; stretch along the topsail-sheets .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 12]: -- Upon my soul , half these children will be killed .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 7]: -- Whose child are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 9]: `` I -- do n't -- know . ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 11]: `` Go and find out , that 's a dear .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 20]: -- Let fall ; sheet home ; belay starboard sheet ; clap on the larboard ; belay all that .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 9]: -- Now , then , Mr Fisher . ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 7]: `` Aye , aye , sir .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 9]: -- Heave away , my lads . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 12]: ` She wo n't wed a Yankee sailor . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 6]: Sally Brown . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 14]: ` For she 's in love with the nigger tailor . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 5]: Sally Brown . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 13]: `` Heave away , my men ; heave , and in sight .

Parsing [sent. 281 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 6]: Sally Brown ! ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 11]: ` Sally Brown , of Buble Alley . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 6]: Sally Brown . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 11]: ` Sally has a cross old granny . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 6]: ` Oh -- ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 11]: `` Heave and fall -- jib-halyards -- hoist away . ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 4]: dear -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 3]: dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 9]: `` The clumsy brute has half-killed the girl !
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 9]: -- Do n't cry , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 17]: `` Pick up the child , Tom , and shove it out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 8]: `` Where shall I put her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 15]: `` Oh , any where just now ; put her on the turkey-coop . ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 4]: `` Starboard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 24]: `` I say , clap on , some of you _ he _ chaps , or else get out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 8]: `` Sailor , mind my band-box . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 4]: `` Starboard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 9]: `` Starboard it is ; steady so . ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 54]: Thus , with the trifling matter of maiming half-a-dozen children , upsetting two or three women , smashing the lids of a few trunks , and crushing some band-boxes as flat as a muffin , the good ship Quebec was at last fairly under weigh , and standing out for St Helen 's .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 25]: 3 p.m. -- Off St Helen 's ; ship steady ; little wind ; water smooth ; passengers sure they wo n't be sick .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 2]: 3:20 .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 13]: -- Apologies from the captain for a cold dinner on this day .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 3]: 4 o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 38]: -- Dinner over ; every body pulls out a number of `` Pickwick ; '' every body talks and reads Pickwick ; weather getting up squally ; passengers not quite so sure they wo n't be seasick .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 10]: Who can tell what the morrow may bring forth ?
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 18]: It brought forth a heavy sea , and the passengers were quite sure that they were seasick .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 36]: Only six out of thirty-eight made their appearance at the breakfast-table ; and , for many days afterwards , there were Pickwicks in plenty strewed all over the cabin , but passengers were very scarce .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 17]: But we had more than sea-sickness to contend with -- the influenza broke out and raged .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 16]: Does not this prove that it is contagious , and not dependant on the atmosphere ?
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 26]: It was hard , after having sniffled with it for six weeks on shore , that I should have another month of it on board .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 6]: But who can control destiny ?
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 24]: The ship was like a hospital ; an elderly woman was the first victim -- then a boy of twelve years of age .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 8]: Fortunately , there were no more deaths .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 9]: But I have said enough of the passage .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 31]: On the 4th of May , in the year of our Lord 1837 , I found myself walking up Broadway , among the free and enlightened citizens of New York .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 16]: A visit , to make it agreeable to both parties , should be well timed .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 36]: My appearance at New York was very much like bursting into a friend 's house with a merry face when there is a death in it -- with the sudden change from levity to condolence .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 10]: `` Any other time most happy to see you .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 10]: You find us in a very unfortunate situation . ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 10]: `` Indeed I 'm very -- very sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 19]: Two hundred and sixty houses have already failed , and no one knows where it is to end .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 13]: Suspicion , fear , and misfortune have taken possession of the city .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 29]: Had I not been aware of the cause , I should have imagined that the plague was raging , and I had the description of Defoe before me .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 37]: Not a smile on one countenance among the crowd who pass and repass ; hurried steps , careworn faces , rapid exchanges of salutation , or hasty communication of anticipated ruin before the sun goes down .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 37]: Here two or three are gathered on one side , whispering and watching that they are not overheard ; there a solitary , with his arms folded and his hat slouched , brooding over departed affluence .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 19]: Mechanics , thrown out of employment , are pacing up and down with the air of famished wolves .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 23]: The violent shock has been communicated , like that of electricity , through the country to a distance of hundreds of miles .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 44]: Canals , railroads , and all public works , have been discontinued , and the Irish emigrant leans against his shanty , with his spade idle in his hand , and starves , as his thoughts wander back to his own Emerald Isle .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 17]: The Americans delight in the hyperbole ; in fact they hardly have a metaphor without it .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 48]: During this crash , when every day fifteen or twenty merchants ' names appeared in the newspapers as bankrupts , one party , not in a very good humour , was hastening down Broadway , when he was run against by another whose temper was equally unamiable .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 8]: This collision roused the choler of both .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 11]: `` What the devil do you mean , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 22]: cried one ; `` I 've a great mind to knock you into _ the middle of next week _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 30]: This occurring on a Saturday , the wrath of the other was checked by the recollection of how very favourable such a blow would be to his present circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 4]: `` Will you !
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 41]: by heavens , then pray do ; it 's just the thing I want , for how else I am to get over next Monday and the acceptances I must take up , is more than I can tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 19]: All the banks have stopped payment in specie , and there is not a dollar to be had .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 24]: I walked down Wall Street , and had a convincing proof of the great demand for money , for somebody picked my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 11]: The militia are under arms , as riots are expected .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 32]: The banks in the country and other towns have followed the example of New York , and thus has General Jackson 's currency bill been repealed without the aid of Congress .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 24]: Affairs are now at their worst , and now that such is the case , the New Yorkers appear to recover their spirits .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 28]: One of the newspapers humorously observes -- `` All Broadway is like unto a new-made widow , and do n't know whether to laugh or cry . ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 21]: There certainly is a very remarkable energy in the American disposition ; if they fall , they bound up again .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 43]: Somebody has observed that the New York merchants are of that _ elastic _ nature , that , when fit for nothing else , they might be converted into _ coach springs _ , and such really appears to be their character .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 50]: Nobody refuses to take the paper of the New York banks , although they virtually have stopped payment ; -- they never refuse anything in New York ; -- but nobody will give specie in change , and great distress is occasioned by this want of a circulating medium .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 60]: Some of the shopkeepers told me that they had been obliged to turn away a hundred dollars a-day , and many a Southerner , who has come up with a large supply of southern notes , has found himself a pauper , and has been indebted to a friend for a few dollars in specie to get home again .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 35]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The radicals here , for there are radicals , it appears , in a democracy -- `` In the lowest depth , a lower deep -- '' are very loud in their complaints .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 100]: I was watching the swarming multitude in Wall Street this morning , when one of these fellows was declaiming against the banks for stopping specie payments , and `` robbing a poor man in such a _ w_illanous manner , '' when one of the merchants , who appeared to know his customer , said to him -- `` Well , as you say , it is hard for a poor fellow like you not to be able to get dollars for his notes ; hand them out , and I 'll give you specie for them myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 17]: The blackguard had not a cent in his pocket , and walked away looking very foolish .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 24]: He reminded me of a little chimney-sweeper at the Tower Hamlets election , asking -- `` Vot vos my hopinions about primaginitur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 23]: -- a very important point to him certainly , he having no parents , and having been brought up by the parish .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 56]: I was in a store when a thorough-bred democrat walked in : he talked loud , and voluntarily gave it as his opinion that all this distress was the very best thing that could have happened to the country , as America would now keep all the specie and pay her English creditors with bankruptcies .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 37]: There always appears to me to be a great want of moral principle in all radicals ; indeed , the levelling principles of radicalism are adverse to the sacred rights of _ meum et tuum _ .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 39]: At Philadelphia the ultra-democrats have held a large public meeting , at which one of the first resolutions brought forward and agreed to was -- `` That they did not owe one farthing to the English people . ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 26]: `` They may say the times are bad , '' said a young American to me , `` but I think that they are excellent .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 28]: A twenty dollar note used to last me but a week , but now it is as good as Fortunatus 's purse , which was never empty .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 16]: I eat my dinner at the hotel , and show them my twenty dollar note .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 25]: The landlord turns away from it , as if it were the head of Medusa , and begs that I will pay another time .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 37]: I buy every thing that I want , and I have only to offer my twenty dollar note in payment , and my credit is unbounded -- that is , for any sum under twenty dollars .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 22]: If they ever do give change again in New York it will make a very unfortunate change in my affairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 43]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A government circular , enforcing the act of Congress , which obliges all those who have to pay custom-house duties or postage to do so in specie , has created great dissatisfaction , and added much to the distress and difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 74]: At the same time that they -LRB- the government -RRB- refuse to take from their debtors the notes of the banks , upon the ground that they are no longer legal tenders , they compel their creditors to take those very notes -- having had a large quantity in their possession at the time that the banks suspended specie payments -- an act of despotism which the English Government would not venture upon .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 8]: Miss Martineau 's work is before me .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 7]: How dangerous it is to prophecy .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 71]: Speaking of the merchants of New York , and their recovering after the heavy losses they sustained by the calamitous fire of 1835 , she says , that although eighteen millions of property were destroyed , not one merchant failed ; and she continues , `` It seems now as if the commercial credit of New York could stand any shock short of an earthquake like that of Lisbon . ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 7]: That was the prophecy of 1836 .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 22]: Where is the commercial credit of New York now in 1837 ?!!! The distress for change has produced a curious remedy .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 8]: Every man is now his own banker .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 24]: Go to the theatres and places of public amusement , and , instead of change , you receive an IOU from the treasury .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 11]: At the hotels and oyster-cellars it is the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 27]: Call for a glass of brandy and water and the change is fifteen tickets , each `` good for one glass of brandy and water . ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 26]: At an oyster-shop , eat a plate of oysters , and you have in return seven tickets , good for one plate of oysters each .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 7]: It is the same every where .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 37]: -- The barbers give you tickets , good for so many shaves ; and were there beggars in the streets , I presume they would give you tickets in change , good for so much philanthropy .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 57]: Dealers , in general , give out their own bank-notes , or as they are called here , _ shin plasters _ , which are good for one dollar , and from that down to two and a-half cents , all of which are redeemable , and redeemable only upon a general return to cash payments .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 10]: Hence arises another variety of exchange in Wall Street .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 13]: `` Tom , do you want any oysters for lunch to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 18]: `` Then here 's a ticket , and give me two _ shaves _ in return . ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 81]: The most prominent causes of this convulsion have already been laid before the English public ; but there is one -- that of speculating in land -- which has not been sufficiently dwelt upon , nor has the importance been given to it which it deserves ; as , perhaps , next to the losses occasioned by the great fire , it led , more than any other species of over-speculation and over-trading , to the distress which has ensued .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 16]: Not but that the event must have taken place in the natural course of things .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 23]: Cash payments produce sure but small returns ; but no commerce can be carried on by this means on any extended scale .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 26]: Credit , as long as it is good , is so much extra capital , in itself nominal and non-existent , but producing real returns .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 55]: If any one will look back upon the commercial history of these last fifty years , he will perceive that the system of credit is always attended with a periodical _ blow up _ ; in England , perhaps , once in twenty years ; in America , once in from seven to ten .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 24]: This arises from their being no safety valve -- no check which can be put to it by mutual consent of all parties .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 19]: One house extends its credit , and for a time , its profits ; another follows the example .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 35]: The facility of credit induces those who obtain it to embark in other speculations , foreign to their business ; for credit thus becomes extra capital which they do not know how to employ .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 23]: Such has been the case in the present instance : but this is no reason for the credit system not being continued .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 47]: These occasional explosions act as warnings , and , for the time , people are more cautious : they stop for a while to repair damages , and recover from their consternation ; and when they go a-head again , it is not quite so fast .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 59]: The loss is severely felt , because people are not prepared to meet it ; but if all the profits of the years of healthy credit were added up , and the balance sheet struck between that and the loss at the explosion , the advantage gained by the credit system would still be found to be great .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 9]: The advancement of America depends wholly upon it .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 39]: It is by credit alone that she has made such rapid strides , and it is by credit alone that she can continue to flourish , at the same time that she enriches those who trade with her .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 50]: In this latter crisis there was more blame to be attached to the English houses , who _ forced _ their credit upon the Americans , than to the Americans , who , having such unlimited credit , thought that they might advantageously speculate with the capital of others .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 40]: One of the most singular affections of the human mind is a proneness to excessive speculation ; and it may here be noticed that the disease for -LRB- such it may be termed -RRB- is peculiarly English and American .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 29]: Men , in their race for gain , appear , like horses that have run away , to have been blinded by the rapidity of their own motion .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 23]: It almost amounts to an epidemic , and is infectious -- the wise and the foolish being equally liable to the disease .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 22]: We had ample evidence of this in the bubble manias which took place in England in the years 1825 and 1826 .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 89]: A mania of this kind had infected the people of America for two or three years previous to the crash : it was that of speculating in land ; and to show the extent to which it had been carried on , we may take the following examples : -- The city of New York , which is built upon a narrow island about ten miles in length , at present covers about three miles of that distance , and has a population of three hundred thousand inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 33]: Building lots were marked out for the other seven miles ; and , by calculation , these lots when built upon , would contain an additional population of one million and three-quarters .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 32]: They were first purchased at from one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars each , but , as the epidemic raged , they rose to upwards of two thousand dollars .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 50]: At Brooklyn , on Long Island , opposite to New York , and about half a mile distant from it , lots were marked out to the extent of fourteen miles , which would contain an extra population of one million , and these were as eagerly speculated in .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 72]: At Staten Island , at the entrance into the Sound , an estate was purchased by some speculators for ten thousand dollars , was divided into lots , and planned as a town to be called New Brighton ; and had the whole of the lots been sold at the price for which many were , previous to the crash , the original speculators would have realised three million of dollars .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 18]: But the infatuation was not confined to the precincts of New York : every where it existed .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 92]: Government lands , which could only be paid for in specie , were eagerly sought after ; plans of new towns were puffed up ; drawings made , in which every street was laid down and named ; churches , theatres , hospitals , rail-road communications , canals , steam-boats in the offing , all appeared on paper as if actually in existence , when , in fact , the very site was as yet a forest , with not a log -- but within a mile of the pretended city .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 30]: Lots in these visionary cities were eagerly purchased , increased daily in value , and afforded a fine harvest to those who took advantage of the credulity of others .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 38]: One man would buy a lot with extensive _ water privileges _ , and , upon going to examine it , would find those privileges rather too extensive , the whole lot being _ under water _ .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 53]: Even after the crisis , there was a man still going about who made a good livelihood by setting up his plan of a city , the lots of which he sold by public auction , on condition of one dollar being paid down to secure the purchase , if approved of .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 20]: The mania had not yet subsided , and many paid down their dollar upon their purchase of a lot .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 6]: This was all he required .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 17]: He went to the next town , and sold the same lots over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 29]: To check this madness of speculation , was one reason why an act of Congress was passed , obliging all purchasers of government lands to pay in specie .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 15]: Nevertheless , government received nine or ten millions in specie after the bill passed .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 81]: Now , when it is considered what a large portion of the capital drawn from England was applied to these wild speculations -- sums which , when they were required , could not be realised , as , when the crisis occurred , property thus purchased immediately fell to about one-tenth of what was paid for it -- it will be clearly seen that , from this unfortunate mania , a great portion of the present distress must have arisen .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 35]: The attempt of General Jackson and his successors , to introduce a specie currency into a country which exists upon credit , was an act of folly , and has ended in complete failure .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 6]: -LSB- See note 1 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 44]: A few weeks after he had issued from the Mint a large coinage of gold , there was hardly an eagle to be seen , and the metal might almost as well have remained in the mine from whence it had been extracted .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 30]: It was still in the country , but had all been absorbed by the agriculturists ; and such will ever be the case in a widely extended agricultural country .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 18]: The farmers , principally Dutch , live upon a portion of their produce and sell the rest .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 32]: Formerly they were content with bank bills or Mexican dollars , which they laid by for a rainy day , and they remained locked up for years before they were required .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 46]: When the gold was issued , it was eagerly collected by these people , as more convenient , and laid by , by the farmers ' wives , in the foot of an old worsted stocking , where the major part of it will remain .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 20]: And thus has the famous gold-currency bill been upset by the hoarding propensities of a parcel of old women .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 6]: -LSB- See note 2 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 4]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note 1 .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 23]: One single proof may be given of the ruinous policy of the Jackson administration in temporising with the credit of the country .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 35]: To check the export of bullion from our country , the Bank of England had but one remedy , that of rendering money scarce : they contracted their issues , and it became so .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 15]: The consequence was , that the price of cotton fell forty dollars per bale .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 29]: The crop of cotton amounted to 1,600,000 bales , which , at forty dollars per bale , was a loss to the southern planters of 64,000,000 of dollars .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 4]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note 2 .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 28]: A curious proof of this system of hoarding , which immediately took place upon the bank stopping payment , was told me by a gentleman from Baltimore .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 32]: He went into a store to purchase , as he often had done , a canvas shot-bag , and to his surprise was asked three times the former price for it .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 48]: Upon his expostulating , the vendors told him , that the demand for them by the farmers and other people who brought their produce to market , and who used them to put their specie in , was so great , that they could hardly supply them .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 26]: Fifty years ago , New York was little more than a village ; now , it is a fine city with three hundred thousand inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 12]: I have never seen any city so admirably adapted for commerce .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 61]: It is built upon a narrow island , between Long Island Sound and the Hudson River , Broadway running up it like the vertebrae of some huge animal , and the other streets diverging from it at right angles , like the ribs ; each street running to the river , and presenting to the view a forest of masts .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 13]: There are some fine buildings in this city , but not many .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 32]: Astor House , although of simple architecture , is , perhaps , the grandest mass ; and next to that , is the City Hall , though in architecture very indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 42]: In the large room of the latter are some interesting pictures and busts of the presidents , mayors of the city , and naval and military officers , who have received the thanks of Congress and the freedom of the city .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 39]: Some are very fair specimens of art : the most spirited is that of Commodore Perry , leaving his sinking vessel , in the combat on the Lakes , to hoist his flag on board of another ship .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 8]: Decatur 's portrait is also very fine .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 14]: Pity that such a man should have been sacrificed in a foolish duel !
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 38]: At the corner of many of the squares , or _ blocks _ of buildings , as they are termed here , is erected a very high mast , with a cap of liberty upon the top .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 73]: The only idea we have of the cap of liberty is , the _ bonnet rouge _ of the French ; but the Americans will not copy the French , although they will the English ; so they have a cap of their own , which -LRB- begging their pardon -RRB- , with its gaudy colours and gilding , looks more like a _ fool 's cap _ than any thing else .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 21]: New York is not equal to London , nor Broadway to Regent Street , although the Americans would compare them .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 69]: Still , New York is very superior to most of our provincial towns , and , to a man who can exist out of London , Broadway will do very well for a lounge -- being wide , three miles long , and the upper part composed of very handsome houses ; besides which , it may almost challenge Regent Street for pretty faces , except on Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 12]: -LSB- On Sundays the coloured population take possession of Broadway . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 63]: Many of the shops , or _ stores _ , as they are here called , -LRB- for in this land of equality nobody keeps a shop -RRB- , have already been fitted up with large plate-glass fronts , similar to those in London , and but for the depression which has taken place , many more would have followed the example .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 19]: Among the few discrepancies observable between this city and London , are the undertakers ' _ shops _ .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 23]: In England they are all wooden windows below and scutcheons above ; planks and shavings within -- in fact , mere workshops .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 45]: Here they are different : they have large glass fronts , like a millinery or cut-glass shop with us , and the shop runs back thirty or forty feet , its sides being filled with coffins standing on end , mahogany and French polished .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 33]: Therein you may select as you please , from the seven feet to receive the well-grown adult , to the tiny receptacle of what Burns calls , `` Wee unchristened babe . ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 27]: I have , however , never heard of any one choosing their own coffin ; they generally leave it to their relatives to perform that office .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 79]: I may here remark , that the Americans are sensible enough not to throw away so much money in funerals as we do ; still it appears strange to an Englishman to see the open hearse containing the body , drawn by only one horse , while the carriages which follow are drawn by two : to be sure , the carriages generally contain six individuals , while the hearse is a sulky , and carries but one .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 41]: The New York tradesmen do all they can , as the English do , to attract the notice of the public by hand-bills , placards , advertisements , etcetera ; but in one point they have gone a-head of us .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 43]: Placards , etcetera , may be read by those who look upwards or straight-forward , or to the right or to the left ; but there are some people who walk with their eyes to the ground , and consequently see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 85]: The New Yorkers have provided for this contingency , by having large marble tablets , like horizontal tomb-stones , let into the flag pavements of the _ trottoir _ in front of their shops , on which is engraven in duplicate , turning both ways , their names and business ; so , whether you walk up or down Broadway , if you cast your eyes downwards so as not to see the placards above , you can not help reading the inscriptions below .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 66]: Every traveller who has visited this city has spoken of the numerous fires which take place in it , and the constant running , scampering , hallooing , and trumpeting of the firemen with their engines ; but I do not observe that any one has attempted to investigate the causes which produce , generally speaking , three or four fires in the twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 38]: New York has certainly great capabilities , and every chance of improvement as a city ; for , about one house in twenty is burnt down every year , and is always rebuilt in a superior manner .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 18]: But , as to the causes , I have , after minute inquiry , discovered as follows .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 7]: These fires are occasioned -- 1st .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 19]: By the notorious carelessness of black servants , and the custom of smoking cigars all the day long .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 2]: 2nd .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 32]: By the knavery of men without capitol , who insure to double and treble the value of their stock , and realise an honest penny by setting fire to their stores .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 17]: -LRB- This is one reason why you can seldom recover from a fire-office without litigation . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 2]: 3rd .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 26]: From the hasty and unsubstantial way in which houses are built up , the rafters and beams often communicating with the flues of the chimneys .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 2]: 4th .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 37]: Conflagrations of houses not insured , effected by agents employed by the _ fire-insurance companies _ , as a punishment to some , and a warning to others , who have neglected to take out policies .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 17]: These were gravely stated to me as the causes of so many fires in New York .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 19]: I can not vouch for the truth of the last , although I feel bound to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 22]: I happen to be lodged opposite to two fire-engine houses , so that I always know when there is a fire .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 57]: Indeed , so does every body ; for the church nearest to it tolls its bell , and this tolling is repeated by all the others ; and as there are more than three hundred churches in New York , if a fire takes place no one can say that he is not aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 44]: The duty of firemen is admirably performed by the young men of the city , who have privileges for a servitude of seven years ; but they pay too dearly for their privileges , which are an exemption from militia and jury summons .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 83]: Many of them are taken off by consumptions , fevers , and severe catarrhs , engendered by the severe trials to which they are exposed : the sudden transitions from extreme heat to extreme cold in winter , being summoned up from a warm bed , when the thermometer is below zero -- then exposed to the scorching flames -- and afterwards -LRB- as I have frequently seen them myself -RRB- , with the water hanging in icicles upon their saturated clothes .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 26]: To recruit themselves after their fatigue and exhaustion they are compelled to drink , and thus it is no wonder that their constitutions are undermined .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 32]: It is nevertheless a favourite service , as the young men have an opportunity of shewing courage and determination , which raises them high in the opinion of their brother citizens .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 20]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I made a purchase at a store ; an intelligent looking little boy brought it home for me .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 36]: As he walked by my side , he amused me very much by putting the following questions : -- `` Pray , captain , has Mr Easy left the King of England 's service ? ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 23]: `` I think he has , '' replied I ; `` if you recollect , he married and went on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 9]: `` Have you seen Mr Japhet lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 5]: was the next query .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 23]: `` Not very lately , '' replied I ; `` the last time I saw him was at the publisher 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 16]: The little fellow went away , perfectly satisfied that they were both alive and well .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 23]: The dogs are all tied up , and the mosquitos have broke loose -- it is high time to leave New York .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 8]: The American steam-boats have been often described .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 73]: When I first saw one of the largest sweep round the battery , with her two decks , the upper one screened with snow-white awnings -- the gay dresses of the ladies -- the variety of colours -- it reminded me of a floating garden , and I fancied that Isola Bella , on the Lake of Como , had got under weigh , and made the first steam voyage to America .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 16]: The Hudson is a noble stream , flowing rapidly through its bold and deep bed .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 25]: Already it has many associations connected with it -- a great many for the time which has elapsed since Henrick Hudson first explored it .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 23]: Where is the race of red men who hunted on its banks , or fished and paddled their canoes in its stream ?
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 19]: They have disappeared from the earth , and scarce a vestige remains of them , except in history .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 14]: No portion of this world was ever intended to remain for ages untenanted .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 47]: Beasts of prey and noxious reptiles are permitted to exist in the wild and uninhabited regions until they are swept away by the broad stream of civilisation , which , as it pours along , drives them from hold to hold , until they finally disappear .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 62]: So it is with the more savage nations : they are but _ tenants at will _ , and never were intended to remain longer than till the time when Civilisation , with the Gospel , Arts , and Sciences , in her train , should appear , and claim as her own that portion of the universe which they occupy .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 36]: About thirty miles above New York is Tarry Town , the abode of Washington Irving , who has here embosomed himself in his own region of romance ; for Sleepy Hollow lies behind his domicile .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 26]: Nearly opposite to it , is the site of a mournful reality -- the spot where poor Major Andre was hung up as a spy .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 36]: You pass the State prison , built on a spot which still retains its Indian name -- Sing Sing -- rather an odd name for a prison , where people are condemned to perpetual silence .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 35]: It is a fine building of white marble , like a palace -- very appropriate for that portion of the _ sovereign _ people , who may qualify themselves for a residence in it .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 14]: I had a genuine Yankee story from one of the party on deck .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 15]: I was enquiring if the Hudson was frozen up or not during the winter ?
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 66]: This led to a conversation as to the severity of the winter , when one man , by way of proving how cold it was , said -- `` Why ; I had a cow on my lot up the river , and last winter she got in among the ice , and was carried down three miles before we could get her out again .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 17]: The consequence has been that she has milked nothing but _ ice-creams _ ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 47]: When you have ascended about fifty miles , the bed of the river becomes contracted and deeper , and it pours its waters rapidly through the high lands on each side , having at some distant time forced its passage through a chain of rocky mountains .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 19]: It was quite dark long before we arrived at West Point , which I had embarked to visit .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 51]: A storm hung over us , and as we passed through the broad masses piled up on each side of the river , at one moment illuminated by the lightning as it burst from the opaque clouds , and the next towering in sullen gloom , the effect was sublime .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 7]: Here I am at West Point .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 12]: West Point is famous in the short history of this country .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 9]: It is the key of the Hudson river .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 33]: The traitor Arnold had agreed to deliver it up to the English , and it was on his return from arranging the terms with Arnold , that Andre was captured and hung .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 19]: At present , a Military College is established here , which turns out about forty officers every year .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 24]: Although they receive commissions in any regiment of the American army when there may be vacancies , they are all educated as engineers .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 27]: The democrats have made several attempts to break up this establishment , as savouring too much of _ monarchy _ , but hitherto have been unsuccessful .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 44]: It would be a pity if they did succeed , for such has been the demand lately for engineers to superintend railroads and canals , that a large portion of them have resigned their commissions , and found employment in the different States .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 45]: This consideration alone is quite sufficient to warrant the keeping up of the college , for civil engineers are a _ sine qua non _ in a country like America , and they are always ready to serve should their military services be required .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 33]: There was an inspection at the time that I was there , and it certainly was highly creditable to the students ; as well as to those who superintend the various departments .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 30]: When I awoke the next morning , I threw open the blinds of my windows , which looked out upon the river , and really was surprised and delighted .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 9]: A more beautiful view I never gazed upon .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 41]: The Rhine was fresh in my memory ; but , although the general features of the two rivers are not dissimilar , there is no one portion of the Rhine which can be compared to the Hudson at West Point .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 52]: It was what you may imagine the Rhine to have been in the days of Caesar , when the lofty mountains through which it sweeps were not bared and naked as they now are , but clothed with forests , and rich in all the variety and beauty of undisturbed nature .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 30]: There is a sweet little spot not far from the college , where a tomb has been erected in honour of Kosciuscko -- it is called Kosciuscko 's Garden .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 15]: I often sat there and talked over the events of the War of Independence .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 13]: Many anecdotes were narrated to me , some of them very original .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 13]: I will mention one or two which have not escaped my memory .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 63]: One of the officers who most distinguished himself in the struggle was a General Starke ; and the following is the speech he is reported to have made to his men previous to an engagement : -- `` Now , my men , -- you see them ere Belgians ; every man of them bought by the king of England at 17s .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 2]: 6d .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 15]: a-head , and I 've a notion he 'd paid too dear for them .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 65]: Now , my men , we either beats them this day , or Molly Starke 's a widow , by G -- d. '' He did beat them , and in his despatch to head-quarters he wrote -- `` We 've had a dreadful hot day of it , General ; and I 've lost my horse , saddle and bridle and all . ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 21]: In those times , losing a _ saddle _ and _ bridle _ was as bad as losing a horse .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 54]: At the same affair , the captain commanding the outposts was very lame , and he thought proper thus to address his men : -- `` Now , my lads , you see we 're only an outpost , and we are not expected to beat the whole army in face of us .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 27]: The duty of an outpost , when the enemy comes on , is to go in , _ tree_ing it , and keeping ourselves not exposed .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 36]: Now , you have my orders ; and as I am a _ little lame _ , I 'll go in first , and mind you do your duty and come in after me . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 17]: I passed several days at this beautiful spot , which is much visited by the Americans .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 35]: Some future day , when America shall have become wealthy , and New York the abode of affluence and ease , what taste may not be lavished on the banks of this noble river !
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 22]: and what a lovely retreat will be West Point , if permitted to remain in all its present wildness and grandeur !
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 21]: I re-embarked at midnight in the steam-boat descending from Albany , and which is fitted out as a night boat .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 52]: When I descended into the cabin , it presented a whimsical sight : two rows of bed-places on each side of the immense cabin , running right fore and aft ; three other rows in the centre , each of these five rows having three bed-places , one over the other .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 42]: There were upwards of five hundred people , lying in every variety of posture , and exhibiting every state and degree of repose -- from the loud uneasy snorer lying on his back , to the deep sleeper tranquil as death .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 23]: I walked up and down , through these long ranges of unconsciousness , thinking how much care was for the time forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 77]: But as the air below was oppressive , and the moon was beautiful in the heavens , I went on deck , and watched the swift career of the vessel , which , with a favouring tide , was flying past the shores at the rate of twenty miles an hour -- one or two people only , out of so many hundreds on board of her , silently watching over the great principle of locomotion .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 70]: The moon sank down , and the sun rose and gilded the verdure of the banks and the spires of the city of New York , as I revelled in my own thoughts and enjoyed the luxury of being alone -- a double luxury in America , where the people are gregarious , and would think themselves very ill-bred if they allowed you one moment for meditation or self-examination .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 10]: Stepped on board of the Narangansett steam-vessel for Providence .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 75]: Here is a fair specimen of American travelling : -- From New York to Providence , by the Long Island Sound , is two hundred miles ; and this is accomplished , under usual circumstances , in thirteen hours : from Providence to Boston , forty miles by railroad , in two hours -- which makes , from New York to Boston , an average speed of sixteen miles an hour , stoppages included .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 36]: I was , I must confess , rather surprised , when in the railroad cars , to find that we were passing through a _ church-yard _ , with tomb-stones on both sides of us .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 71]: In Rhode Island and Massachusetts , where the pilgrim-fathers first landed -- the two States that take pride to themselves -LRB- and with justice -RRB- for superior morality and a strict exercise of religious observances -- they look down upon the other States of the Union , especially New York , and cry out , `` I thank thee , Lord , that I am not as that publican . ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 51]: Yet here , in Rhode Island , are the sleepers of the railway laid over the sleepers in death ; here do they grind down the bones of their ancestors for the sake of gain , and consecrated earth is desecrated by the iron wheels , loaded with Mammon-seeking mortals .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 10]: And this in the puritanical state of Rhode Island !
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 13]: Would any engineer have ventured to propose such a line in England ?
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 4]: I think not .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 9]: After all , it is but human nature .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 52]: I have run over the world a long while , and have always observed that people are very religious so long as religion does not interfere with their pockets ; but , with gold in one hand and godliness in the other , the tangible is always preferred to the immaterial .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 13]: In America everything is sacrificed to time -- for time is money .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 31]: The New Yorkers would have dashed right through the church itself ; but then , _ they _ are publicans , and do n't _ pretend _ to be good .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 21]: Boston is a fine city , and , as a commercial one , almost as well situated as New York .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 30]: It has , however , lost a large portion of its commerce , which the latter has gradually wrested from it , and it must eventually lose much more .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 47]: The population of Boston is about eighty thousand , and it has probably more people of leisure in it -LRB- that is , out of business and living on their own means -RRB- than even Philadelphia ; taking into the estimate the difference between the populations .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 33]: They are more learned and scientific here than at New York , though not more so than at Philadelphia ; but they are more English than in any other city in America .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 15]: The Massachusetts people are very fond of comparing their country with that of England .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 19]: The scenery is not unlike ; but it is not like England in its high state of cultivation .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 9]: Stone walls are bad substitutes for green hedges .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 13]: Still , there are some lovely spots in the environs of Boston .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 27]: Mount Auburn , laid out as a Pere la Chaise , is , in natural beauties , far superior to any other place of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 52]: One would almost wish to be buried there ; and the proprietors , anxious to have it peopled , offer , by their arrangements as to the price of places of interment , a handsome premium to those who will soonest die and be buried -- which is certainly a consideration .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 9]: Fresh Pond is also a very romantic spot .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 23]: It is a lake of about two hundred acres , whose water is so pure that the ice is transparent as glass .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 14]: Its proprietor clears many thousand dollars a year by the sale of it .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 48]: It is cut out in blocks of three feet square , and supplies most parts of America down to New Orleans ; and every winter latterly two or three ships have been loaded and sent to Calcutta , by which a very handsome profit has been realised .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 21]: Since I have been here , I have made every enquiry relative to the sea-serpent which frequents this coast alone .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 37]: There are many hundreds of most respectable people , who , on other points , would be considered as incapable of falsehood , who declare they have seen the animals , and vouch for their existence .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 37]: It is rather singular that in America there is but one copy of Bishop Pontoppidon 's work on Norway , and in it the sea-serpent is described , and a rough wood-cut of its appearance given .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 41]: In all the American newspapers a drawing was given of the animal as described by those who saw it , and it proved to be almost a _ fac-simile _ of the one described by the Bishop in his work .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 35]: Now that we are on marine matters , I must notice the prodigious size of the lobsters off Boston Coast : they could stow a dozen common English lobsters under their coats of mail .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 28]: My very much respected friend Sir Isaac Coffin , when he was here , once laid a wager that he would produce a lobster weighing thirty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 32]: The bet was accepted , and the admiral despatched people to the proper quarter to procure one : but they were not then in season , and could not be had .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 35]: The admiral , not liking to lose his money , brought up , instead of the lobster , the affidavits of certain people that they had often seen lobsters of that size and weight .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 21]: The affidavits of the deponents he submitted to the other party , and pretended that he had won the wager .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 27]: The case was referred to arbitration , and the admiral was cast with the following pithy reply , '' _ Depositions are not lobsters _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 17]: Massachusetts is certainly very English in its scenery , and Boston essentially English as a city .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 38]: The Bostonians assert that they are more English than we are , that is , that they have strictly adhered to the old English customs and manners , as handed down to them previous to the Revolution .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 60]: That of sitting a very long while at their wine after dinner , is one which they certainly adhere to , and which , _ I _ think , would be more honoured in the breach than the observance ; but their hospitality is unbounded , and you do , as an Englishman , feel at home with them .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 28]: I agree with the Bostonians so far , that they certainly appear to have made no change in their manners and customs for these last hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 51]: You meet here with frequent specimens of the Old English Gentleman , descendants of the best old English families who settled here long before the Revolution , and are now living on their incomes , with a town house and a country seat to retire to during the summer season .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 28]: The society of Boston is very delightful ; it wins upon you every day , and that is the greatest compliment that can be paid to it .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 51]: Perhaps of all the Americans the Bostonians are the most sensitive to any illiberal remarks made upon the country , for they consider themselves , and pride themselves , as being peculiarly English ; while , on the contrary , the majority of the Americans deny that they are English .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 18]: There certainly is less intermixture of foreign blood in this city than in any other in America .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 49]: It will appear strange , but so wedded are they to old customs , even to John Bullism , that it is not more than seven or eight years that French wines have been put on the Boston tables , and become in general use in this city .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 27]: It is a pity that this feeling towards England is not likely to continue ; indeed , even at this moment it is gradually wearing away .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 5]: Self-interest governs the world .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 77]: At the declaration of the last war with England , it was the Northern States which were so opposed to it , and the Southern who were in favour of it : but now circumstances have changed ; the Northern States , since the advance in prosperity and increase of produce in the Southern and Western States , feel aware that it is only as manufacturing states that they can hold their rank with the others .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 39]: Their commerce has decreased since the completion of the Erie and Ohio canals , and during the war they discovered the advantage that would accrue to them , as manufacturers , to supply the Southern and Western markets .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 10]: The imports of English goods have nearly ruined them .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 36]: They now manufacture nothing but coarse articles , and as you travel through the Eastern countries , you are surprised to witness splendid fabrics commenced , but , for want of encouragement , not finished .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 10]: This has changed the interests of the opponent States .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 54]: The Southern are very anxious to remain at peace with England , that their produce may find a market ; while the Northern , on the contrary , would readily consent to a war , that they might shut out the English manufactures , and have the supply entirely in their own hands .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 32]: The Eastern States -LRB- I particularly refer to Massachusetts , Connecticut , and Rhode Island -RRB- offer a proof of what can be effected by economy , prudence , and industry .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 74]: Except on the borders of the rivers , the lands are generally sterile , and the climate is severe , yet , perhaps , the population is more at its ease than in any other part of the Union ; but the produce of the States is not sufficient for the increasing population , or rather what the population would have been had it not migrated every year to the West and South .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 59]: They set a higher value upon good connections in these poor States than they do in others ; and if a daughter is to be married , they will ask what family the suitor is of , and if it bears a good name , they are quite indifferent as to whether he has a cent or not .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 101]: It is remarkable , that if a man has three or four sons in these States , one will be a lawyer , another a medical man , another a clergyman , and one will remain at home to take the property ; and thus , out of the proceeds of a farm , perhaps not containing more than fifty acres , all these young men shall be properly educated , and in turn sent forth to the West and South , where they gain an honourable independence , and very often are sent to Congress as senators and representatives .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 14]: Industry and frugality are the only entailed estate bequeathed from father to son .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 16]: Yet this State alone manufactures to the value of 86,282,616 of dollars in the year .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 56]: As a general axiom it may fairly be asserted , that the more sterile the soil , the more virtuous , industrious , and frugal are the inhabitants ; and it may be added , that such a country sends out more clever and intelligent men than one that is nominally more blessed by Providence .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 44]: The fact is , without frugality and industry the Eastern States could not exist ; they become virtues of necessity , and are the basis of others ; whilst , where there is abundance , vice springs up and idleness takes deep root .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 12]: The population of Massachusetts is by the last returns 701,331 souls .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 13]: I rather think the proportion of women to men is very great .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 42]: An energetic and enterprising people are naturally anxious for an investigation into cause and effect , a search into which is , after all , nothing but curiosity well directed , and the most curious of all men is the philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 20]: Curiosity , therefore , becomes a virtue or a small vice , according to the use made of it .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 26]: The Americans are excessively curious , especially the mob : they can not bear anything like a secret , -- that 's _ unconstitutional _ .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 27]: It may be remembered , that the Catholic Convent near Boston , which had existed many years , was attacked by the mob and pulled down .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 64]: I was enquiring into the cause of this outrage in a country where all forms of religion are tolerated ; and an American gentleman told me , that although other reasons had been adduced for it , he fully believed , in his own mind , that the majority of the mob were influenced more by _ curiosity _ than any other feeling .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 20]: The Convent was _ sealed _ to them , and they were determined to know what was in it .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 72]: `` Why , sir , '' continued he , `` I will lay a wager that if the authorities were to nail together a dozen planks , and fix them up on the Common , with a caution to the public that they were not to go near or touch them , in twenty-four hours a mob would be raised to pull them down and ascertain what the planks contained . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 29]: I mention this conversation , to shew in what a dexterous manner this American gentleman attempted to palliate one of the grossest outrages ever committed by his countrymen .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 27]: Crossed over to New Jersey , and took the railroad , to view the falls of the Passaic River , about fifteen miles from New York .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 24]: This water-power has given birth to Patterson , a town with ten thousand inhabitants , where a variety of manufactures is carried on .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 60]: A more beautiful wild spot can hardly be conceived ; and to an European who has been accustomed to travel far in search of the picturesque , it appears singular that at so short a distance from a large city , he should at once find himself in the midst of such a strange combination of nature and art .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 20]: Independent of their beauty , they are , perhaps , the most singular falls that are known to exist .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 17]: The whole country is of trappe formation , and the black rocks rise up strictly vertical .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 63]: The river , which at the Falls is about one hundred and twenty yards wide , pours over a bed of rock between hills covered with chestnut , walnut , pine , and sycamore , all mingled together , and descending to the edge of the bank ; their bright and various foliage forming a lovely contrast to the clear rushing water .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 33]: The bed of black rock over which the river runs , is , at the Fall , suddenly split in two , vertically , and across the whole width of the river .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 19]: The fissure is about seventy feet deep , and not more than twelve feet wide at any part .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 37]: Down into this chasm pour the whole waters of the river , escaping from it , at a right angle , into a deep basin , surrounded with perpendicular rocks from eighty to ninety feet high .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 36]: You may therefore stand on the opposite side of the chasm , looking up the river , within a few feet of the Fall , and watch the roaring waters as they precipitate themselves below .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 81]: In this position , with the swift , clear , but not deep waters before you , forcing their passage through the rocky bed , with the waving trees on each side , their branches feathering to the water 's edge , or dipping and rising in the stream , you might imagine yourself far removed from your fellow-men , and you feel that in such a beauteous spot you could well turn anchorite , and commune with Nature alone .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 42]: But turn round with your back to the Fall -- look below , and all is changed : art in full activity -- millions of reels whirling in their sockets -- the bright polished cylinders incessantly turning , and never tiring .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 53]: What formerly was the occupation of thousands of industrious females , who sat with their distaff at the cottage door , is now effected in a hundredth part of the time , and in every variety , by those compressed machines which require but the attendance of one child to several hundreds .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 28]: But machinery can not perform everything , and notwithstanding this reduction of labour , the romantic Falls of the Passaic find employment for the industry of thousands .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 42]: We walked up the banks of the river above the Fall , and met with about twenty or thirty urchins who were bathing at the mouth of the cut , made for the supply of the water-power to the manufactories below .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 41]: The river is the property of an individual , and is very valuable : he receives six hundred dollars per annum for one square foot of water-power ; ten years hence it will be rented at a much higher price .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 57]: We amused ourselves by throwing small pieces of money into the water , where it was about a fathom deep , for the boys to dive after ; they gained them too easily ; we went to another part in the _ cut _ , where it was much deeper , and threw in a dollar .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 45]: The boys stood naked on the rocks , like so many cormorants , waiting to dart upon their prey ; when the dollar had had time to sink to the bottom the word was given -- they all dashed down like lightning and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 47]: About a minute elapsed ere there was any sign of their re-appearance , when they came up , one by one , breathless and flushed -LRB- like racers who had pulled up -RRB- , and at last the victor appeared with the dollar between his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 15]: We left these juvenile _ Sam Patches _ , and returned to the town .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 26]: -LSB- Sam Patch , an American peripatetic , who used to amuse himself and astonish his countrymen by leaping down the different falls in America .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 30]: He leaped down a portion of the Niagara without injury ; but one fine day , having taken a drop too much , he took a leap too much .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 21]: He went down the Genassee Fall , and since that time he has not been seen or heard of . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 32]: There is no part of the world , perhaps , where you have more difficulty in obtaining permission to be alone , and indulge in a reverie , than in America .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 19]: The Americans are as gregarious as school-boys , and think it an incivility to leave you by yourself .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 12]: Every thing is done in crowds , and among a crowd .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 28]: They even prefer a double bed to a single one , and I have often had the offer to sleep with me made out of real kindness .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 20]: You must go `` east of sun-rise '' -LRB- or west of sun-set -RRB- if you would have solitude .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 63]: I never was in a more meditative humour , more anxious to be left to my own dreamings , than when I ascended the railroad car with my companion to return to Jersey city ; we were the only two in that division of the car , and my friend , who understood me , had the complaisance to go fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 37]: I made sure that , for an hour or two , I could indulge in my own castle-buildings , and allow my fleeting thoughts to pass over my brain , like the scud over the moon .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 15]: At our first stoppage a third party stepped in and seated himself between us .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 11]: He looked at my companion , who was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 12]: He turned to me , and I turned away my head .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 92]: Once more was I standing at the Falls of the Passaic ; once more were the waters rolling down before me , the trees gracefully waving their boughs to the breeze , and the spray cooling my heated brain ; my brain was , like the camera-obscura , filled with the pleasing images , which I watched as they passed before me so vividly portrayed , all in life and motion , when I was interrupted by -- `` I was born in the very heart of Cheshire , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 4]: Confound the fellow !
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 39]: The river , falls , foliage , all vanished at once ; and I found myself sitting in a railroad-car -LRB- which I had been unconscious of -RRB- , with a heavy lump of humanity by my side .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 12]: I wished one of the largest Cheshire cheeses down his throat .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 9]: replied I , not looking at the man .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir -- in the very heart of Cheshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 8]: `` Would you had staid there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 11]: thought I , turning away to the window without replying .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 14]: `` Will you oblige me with a pinch of your snuff , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 9]: I left my box at New York . ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 57]: I gave him the box , and , when he had helped himself , laid it down on the vacant seat opposite to him , that he might not have to apply again , and fell back and shut my eyes , as a hint to him that I did not wish to enter into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 14]: A pause ensued , and I had hopes ; but they were delusive .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 13]: `` I have been eighteen years in this country , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 11]: `` You appear to be quite _ Americanised _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 10]: thought I ; but I made him no answer .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 53]: `` I went up to Patterson , sir , '' continued he -LRB- now turning round to me , and speaking in my ear -RRB- , `` thinking that I could get to Philadelphia by that route , and found that I had made a mistake ; so I have come back .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 15]: I am _ told _ there are some pretty falls there , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 8]: `` Would you were beneath them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 26]: thought I ; but I could not help laughing at the idea of a man going to Patterson , and returning without seeing the falls !
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 59]: By this time he had awakened his companion , who , being American himself , and finding that there was to be no more sleep , took him up , in the American fashion , and put to him successively the following questions , all of which were answered without hesitation : -- `` What is your name ?
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 5]: where are you from ?
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 5]: where are you going ?
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 5]: what is your profession ?
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 7]: how many dollars have you made ?
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 8]: have you a wife and children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 37]: All these being duly responded to , he asked my companion who I might be , and was told that I was an operative artist , and one of the first cotton spinners in the country .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 18]: This communication procured for me considerable deference from our new acquaintance during the remainder of our journey .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 19]: He observed in the ear of my companion , that he thought I knew a thing or two .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 12]: In a country like America the Utilitarian will always command respect .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 12]: The 4th of July , the sixty-first anniversary of American independence !
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 15]: Pop -- pop -- bang -- pop -- pop -- bang -- bang bang !
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 4]: Mercy on us !
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 12]: how fortunate it is that anniversaries come only once a year .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 32]: Well , the Americans may have great reason to be proud of this day , and of the deeds of their forefathers , but why do they get so confoundedly drunk ?
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 22]: why , on this day of independence , should they become so _ dependent _ upon posts and rails for support ?
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 22]: The day is at last over ; my head aches , but there will be many more aching heads tomorrow morning !
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 12]: What a combination of vowels and consonants have been put together !
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 17]: what strings of tropes , metaphors , and allegories , have been used on this day !
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 7]: what varieties and gradations of eloquence !
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 61]: There are at least fifty thousand cities , towns , villages , and hamlets , spread over the surface of America -- in each the Declaration of Independence has been read ; in all one , and in some two or three , orations have been delivered , with as much gunpowder in them as in the squibs and crackers .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 9]: But let me describe what I actually saw .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 108]: The commemoration commenced , if the day did not , on the evening of the 3rd , by the municipal police going round and pasting up placards , informing the citizens of New York , that all persons letting off fireworks would be taken into custody , which notice was immediately followed up by the little boys proving their independence of the authorities , by letting off squibs , crackers , and bombs ; and cannons , made out of shin bones , which flew in the face of every passenger , in the exact ratio that the little boys flew in the face of the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 47]: This continued the whole night , and thus was ushered in the great and glorious day , illumined by a bright and glaring sun -LRB- as if bespoken on purpose by the mayor and corporation -RRB- , with the thermometer at 90 degrees in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 43]: The first sight which met the eye after sunrise , was the precipitate escape , from a city visited with the plague of gunpowder , of respectable or timorous people in coaches , carriages , waggons , and every variety of vehicle .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 8]: `` My kingdom for a horse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 13]: was the general cry of all those who could not stand fire .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 13]: In the mean while , the whole atmosphere was filled with independence .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 45]: Such was the quantity of American flags which were hoisted on board of the vessels , hung out of windows , or carried about by little boys , that you saw more stars at noon-day than ever could be counted on the brightest night .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 69]: On each side of the whole length of Broadway , were ranged booths and stands , similar to those at an English fair , and on which were displayed small plates of oysters , with a fork stuck in the board opposite to each plate ; clams sweltering in the hot sun ; pineapples , boiled hams , pies , puddings , barley-sugar , and many other indescribables .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 39]: But what was most remarkable , Broadway being three miles long , and the booths lining each side of it , in every booth there was a roast pig , large or small , as the centre attraction .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 6]: Six miles of roast pig !
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 27]: and that in New York city alone ; and roast pig in every other city , town , hamlet , and village , in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 11]: What association can there be between roast pig and independence ?
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 24]: Let it not be supposed that there was any deficiency in the very necessary articks of potation on this auspicious day : no !
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 56]: the booths were loaded with porter , ale , cyder , mead , brandy , wine , ginger-beer , pop , soda-water , whiskey , rum , punch , gin slings , cocktails , mint julips , besides many other compounds , to name which nothing but the luxuriance of American-English could invent a word .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 28]: Certainly the preparations in the refreshment way were most imposing , and gave you some idea of what had to be gone through on this auspicious day .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 39]: Martial music sounded from a dozen quarters at once ; and as you turned your head , you tacked to the first bars of a march from one band , the concluding bars of Yankee Doodle from another .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 46]: At last the troops of militia and volunteers , who had been gathering in the park and other squares , made their appearance , well dressed and well equipped , and , in honour of the day , marching as independently as they well could .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 30]: I did not see them go through many manoeuvres , but there was one which they appeared to excel in , and that was grounding arms and eating pies .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 17]: I found that the current went towards Castle Garden , and away I went with it .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 22]: There the troops were all collected on the green , shaded by the trees , and the effect was very beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 15]: The artillery and infantry were drawn up in a line pointing to the water .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 45]: The officers in their regimental dresses and long white feathers , generals and aides-de-camp , colonels , commandants , majors , all galloping up and down in front of the line , -- white horses and long tails appearing the most fashionable and correct .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 16]: The crowds assembled were , as American crowds usually are , quiet and well behaved .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 20]: I recognised many of my literary friends turned into generals , and flourishing their swords instead of their pens .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 47]: The scene was very animating ; the shipping at the wharfs were loaded with star-spangled banners ; steamers paddling in every direction , were covered with flags ; the whole beautiful Sound was alive with boats and sailing vessels , all flaunting with pennants and streamers .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 18]: It was , as Ducrow would call it , `` A Grand Military and Aquatic Spectacle . ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 29]: Then the troops marched up into town again , and so did I follow them as I used to do the reviews in England , when a boy .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 31]: All creation appeared to be independent on this day ; some of the horses particularly so , for they would not keep `` in no line not no how . ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 64]: Some preferred going sideways like crabs , others went backwards , some would not go at all , others went a great deal too fast , and not a few parted company with their riders , whom they kicked off just to shew their independence ; but let them go which way they would , they could not avoid the squibs and crackers .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 54]: And the women were in the same predicament : they might dance right , or dance left , it was only out of the frying-pan into the fire , for it was pop , pop ; bang , bang ; fiz , pop , bang , so that you literally trod upon gunpowder .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 31]: When the troops marched up Broadway , louder even than the music were to be heard the screams of delight from the children at the crowded windows on each side .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 3]: `` Ma !
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 2]: ma !
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 5]: there 's pa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 5]: there 's John . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 10]: `` Look at uncle on his big horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 30]: The troops did not march in very good order , because , independently of their not knowing how , there was a great deal of independence to contend with .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 73]: At one time an omnibus and four would drive in and cut off the general and his staff from his division ; at another , a cart would roll in and insist upon following close upon the band of music ; so that it was a mixed procession -- Generals , omnibus and four , music , cart-loads of bricks , troops , omnibus and pair , artillery , hackney-coach , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 2]: etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 50]: Notwithstanding all this , they at last arrived at the City Hall , when those who were old enough heard the Declaration of Independence read for the sixty-first time ; and then it was -- `` Begone , brave army , and do n't kick up a row . ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 15]: I was invited to dine with the mayor and corporation at the City Hall .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 51]: We sat down in the Hall of Justice , and certainly , great justice was done to the dinner , which -LRB- as the wife says to her husband after a party , where the second course follows the first with unusual celerity -RRB- `` went off remarkably well . ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 11]: The crackers popped outside , and the champagne popped in .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 45]: The celerity of the Americans at a public dinner is very commendable ; they speak only now and then ; and the toasts follow so fast , that you have just time to empty your glass , before you are requested to fill again .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 17]: Thus the arranged toasts went off rapidly , and after them , any one might withdraw .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 65]: I waited till the thirteenth toast , the last on the paper , to wit , the ladies of America ; and , having previously , in a speech from the recorder , bolted Bunker 's Hill and New Orleans , I thought I might as well bolt myself , as I wished to see the fireworks , which were to be very splendid .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 47]: Unless you are an amateur , there is no occasion to go to the various places of public amusement where the fireworks are let off , for they are sent up every where in such quantities that you hardly know which way to turn your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 83]: It is , however , advisable to go into some place of safety , for the little boys and the big boys have all got their supply of rockets , which they fire off in the streets -- some running horizontally up the pavement , and sticking into the back of a passenger ; and others mounting slantingdicularly and Paul-Prying into the bed-room windows on the third floor or attics , just to see how things are going on _ there _ .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 47]: Look in any point of the compass , and you will see a shower of rockets in the sky : turn from New York to Jersey City , from Jersey City to Brooklyn , and shower is answered by shower on either side of the water .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 42]: Hoboken repeats the signal : and thus it is carried on to the east , the west , the north , and the south , from Rhode Island to the Missouri , from the Canada frontier to the Gulf of Mexico .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 22]: At the various gardens the combinations were very beautiful , and exceeded anything that I had witnessed in London or Paris .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 73]: What with sea-serpents , giant rockets scaling heaven , Bengal lights , Chinese fires , Italian suns , fairy bowers , crowns of Jupiter , exeranthemums , Tartar temples , Vesta 's diadems , magic circles , morning glories , stars of Colombia , and temples of liberty , all America was in a blaze ; and , in addition to this mode of manifesting its joy , all America was tipsy .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 12]: There is something grand in the idea of a national intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 48]: In this world , vices on a grand scale dilate into virtues ; he who murders one man , is strung up with ignominy ; but he who murders twenty thousand has a statue to his memory , and is handed down to posterity as a hero .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 54]: A staggering individual is a laughable and , sometimes , a disgusting spectacle ; but the whole of a vast continent reeling , offering a holocaust of its brains for mercies vouchsafed , is an appropriate tribute of gratitude for the rights of equality and the _ levelling spirit _ of their institutions .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 8]: Once more flying up the noble Hudson .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 37]: After you have passed West Point , the highlands , through which the river has forced its passage , gradually diminish , and as the shore becomes level , so does the country become more fertile .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 48]: We passed the manor of Albany , as it is called , being a Dutch grant of land , now in the possession of one person , a Mr Van Rensalaer , and equal to many a German principality , being twenty miles by forty-eight miles square .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 11]: Mr Van Rensalaer still retains the old title of Patroon .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 26]: It is generally supposed in England that , in America , all property must be divided between the children at the decease of the parent .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 6]: This is not the case .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 31]: The entailing of estates was abolished by an act of Congress in 1788 , but a man may will away his property entirely to his eldest son if he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 26]: This is , however , seldom done ; public opinion is too strong against it , and the Americans fear public opinion beyond the grave .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 40]: Indeed , were a man so to act , the other claimants would probably appeal to have the will set aside upon the grounds of lunacy , and the sympathy of an American jury would decree in their favour .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 30]: As you ascend to Albany City , the banks of the river are very fertile and beautiful , and the river is spotted with many very picturesque little islands .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 25]: The country seats , which fringe the whole line of shore , are all built in the same , and very bad , style .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 33]: Every house or tenement , be it a palace or a cottage , has its porticos and pillars -- a string of petty Parthenons which tire you by their uniformity and pretence .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 59]: I had intended to stop at Hudson , that I might proceed from thence to New Lebanon to visit the Shaking Quakers ; but , as I discovered that there was a community of them not five miles from Troy , I , to avoid a fatiguing journey , left Albany , and continued on to that city .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 26]: Albany is one of the oldest Dutch settlements , and among its inhabitants are to be found many of the descendants of the Dutch aristocracy .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 13]: Indeed , it may even now be considered as a Dutch city .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 18]: It is the capital of the state of New York , with a population of nearly 30,000 .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 32]: Its commerce is very extensive , as it is here that the Erie canal communications with the Far West , as well as the Eastern States , debouche into the Hudson .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 29]: We have here a singular proof , not only of the rapidity with which cities rise in America , but also how superior energy will overcome every disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 28]: Little more than twenty years ago , Albany stood by itself , a large and populous city without a rival , but its population was chiefly Dutch .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 24]: The Yankees from the Eastern States came down and settled themselves at Troy , not five miles distant , in opposition to them .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 60]: It would be supposed that Albany could have crushed this city in its birth , but it could not , and Troy is now a beautiful city , with its mayor , its corporation , and a population of 20,000 souls , and divides the commerce with Albany , from which most of the eastern trade has been ravished .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 14]: The inhabitants of Albany are termed Albanians , those of Troy , Trojans !
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 18]: In one feature these cities are very similar , being both crowded with lumber and pretty girls .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 10]: I went out to see the Shakers at Niskayuna .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 46]: So much has already been said about their tenets that I shall not repeat them , further than to observe that all their goods are in common , and that , although the sexes mix together , they profess the vows of celibacy and chastity .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 16]: Their lands are in excellent order , and they are said to be very rich .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 78]: -LSB- I should be very sorry to take away the character of any community , but , as I was a little sceptical as to the possibility of the vow of chastity being observed under circumstances above alluded to , I made some inquiries , and having met with one who had seceded from the fraternity , I discovered that my opinion of human nature was correct , and the conduct of the Shakers not altogether so .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 16]: I must not enter into details , as they would be unfit for publication . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 31]: We were admitted into a long room on the ground-floors where the Shakers were seated on forms , the men opposite to the women , and apart from each other .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 18]: The men were in their waistcoats and shirt-sleeves , twiddling their thumbs , and looking awfully puritanical .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 27]: The women were attired in dresses of very light striped cotton , which hung about them like full dressing-gowns , and concealed all shape and proportions .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 24]: A plain mob cap on their heads , and a thick muslin handkerchief in many folds over their shoulders , completed their attire .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 21]: They each held in their hands a pocket-handkerchief as large as a towel , and of almost the same substance .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 22]: But the appearance of the women was melancholy and unnatural ; I say unnatural because it required to be accounted for .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 98]: They had all the advantages of exercise and labour in the open air , good food , and good clothing ; they were not overworked , for they are not required to work more than they please ; and yet there was something so pallid , so unearthly in their complexions , that it gave you the idea that they had been taken up from their coffins a few hours after their decease : not a hue of health , not a vestige of colour in any cheek or lip ; -- one cadaverous yellow tinge prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 29]: And yet there were to be seen many faces very beautiful , as far as regarded outline , but they were the features of the beautiful in death .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 15]: The men , on the contrary , were ruddy , strong , and vigorous .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 34]: Why , then , this difference between the sexes , where they each performed the same duties , where none were taxed beyond their strength , and all were well fed and clothed ?
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 55]: After a silence of ten minutes , one of the men of the community , evidently a coarse illiterate person , rose and addressed a few words to the spectators , requesting them not to laugh at what they saw , but to behave themselves properly , etcetera , and then he sat down .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 25]: One of the leaders then burst out into a hymn , to a jigging sort of tune , and all the others joined chorus .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 64]: After the hymn was sung they all rose , put away the forms on which they had been seated , and stood in lines , eight in a row , men and women separate , facing each other , and about ten feet apart -- the ranks of men being flanked by the boys , and those of the women by the girls .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 48]: They commenced their dancing by advancing in rows , just about as far as profane people do in _ L'ete _ when they dance quadrilles , and then retreated the same distance , all keeping regular time , and turning back to back after every third advance .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 79]: The movement was rather quick , and they danced to their own singing of the following beautiful composition : -- Law , law , de lawdel law , Law , law , de law , Law , law , de lawdel law , Lawdel , lawdel , law -- keeping time also with the hands as well as feet , the former raised up to the chest , and hanging down like the fore-paws of a dancing bear .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 27]: After a quarter of an hour they sat down again , and the women made use of their large towel pocket-handkerchiefs to wipe off the perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 47]: Another hymn was sung , and then the same person addressed the spectators , requesting them not to laugh , and inquiring if any of them felt a wish to be saved -- adding , `` Not one of you , I do n't think . ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 47]: He looked round at all of us with the most ineffable contempt , and then sat down ; and they sang another hymn , the burden of which was -- `` Our souls are saved , and we are free From vice and all in-i-qui-ty . ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 11]: which was a very comfortable delusion , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 18]: They then rose again , put away the forms as before , and danced in another fashion .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 13]: Instead of _ L'ete _ , it was _ Grande ronde _ .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 55]: About ten men and women stood in two lines in the centre of the room , as a vocal band of music , while all the others , two and two , women first and men following , promenaded round , with a short quick step , to the tune chaunted in the centre .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 42]: As they went round and round , shaking their paws up and down before them , the scene was very absurd , and I could have laughed had I not felt disgusted at such a degradation of rational and immortal beings .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 34]: This dance lasted a long while , until the music turned to croaking , and the perspiration was abundant ; they stopped at last , and then announced that their exercise was finished .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 20]: I waited a little while after the main body had dispersed , to speak with one of the elders .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 22]: `` I will be with you directly , '' replied he , walking hastily away ; but he never came back .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 10]: I never heard the principle upon which they dance .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 21]: David danced before the ark ; but it is to be presumed that David danced as well as he sung .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 24]: At least he thought so ; for when his wife Michal laughed at him , he made her conduct a ground of divorce .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 30]: Every community which works in common , and is provided for in the mass , must become _ rich _ , especially when it has no children to maintain .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 33]: It is like receiving a person 's labour in exchange for victuals and clothing only , and this is all I can perceive that can be said in favour of these people .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 42]: Suffice it to say , I have a very bad opinion of them : and were I disposed to dilate on the subject , I should feel no inclination to treat them with the lenity shewn to them by other travellers .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 31]: From this mockery , I went to see what had a real tendency to make you feel religious -- the Falls of the Mohawk , about three miles from Troy .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 100]: Picturesque and beautiful as all falling water is , to describe it is extremely difficult , unless , indeed by a forced simile ; the flow of language is too tame for the flow of water ; but if the reader can imagine a ledge of black rocks , about sixty or seventy feet high , and that over this ledge was poured simultaneously the milk of some millions of cows , he will then have some idea of the beauty of the creaming Falls of the Mohawk , imbedded as they are in their wild and luxuriant scenery .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 53]: Close to the Falls , I perceived a few small wooden shealings , appearing , under the majestic trees which overshadowed them , more like dog-kennels than the habitations of men : they were tenanted by Irish emigrants , who had taken work at the new locks forming on the Erie canal .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 6]: I went up to them .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 42]: In a tenement about fourteen feet by ten , lived an Irishman , his wife , and family , and seven boys as he called them , young men from twenty to thirty years of age , who boarded with him .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 18]: There was but one bed , on which slept the man , his wife , and family .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 35]: Above the bed were some planks , extending half way the length of the shealing , and there slept the seven boys , without any mattress , or even straw , to lie upon .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 39]: I entered into conversation with them : they complained bitterly of the times , saying that their pay was not 2 shillings 6 pence of our money per day , and that they could not live upon it .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 34]: This was true , but the distress had been communicated to all parts , and they were fortunate in finding work at all , as most of the public works had been discontinued .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 37]: I mentioned to them that the price of labour in Ohio , Illinois , and the West , was said to be two dollars a-day , and asked them , why they did not go there ?
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 59]: They replied , that such were the price quoted , to induce people to go , but that they never could find it when they arrived ; that the clearing of new lands was attended with ague and fever ; and that if once down with these diseases there was no one to help them to rise again .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 18]: I looked for the pig , and there he was , sure enough , under the bed .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 29]: Troy , like a modern academy , is classical , as well as commercial , having Mount Olympus on one side , and Mount Ida in its rear .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 11]: The panorama from the summit of the latter is splendid .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 25]: A few years back a portion of Mount Ida made a slip , and the avalanche destroyed several cottages and five or six individuals .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 15]: The avalanche took place on a dark night and in a heavy snow storm .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 38]: Two brick kilns were lighted at the time , and , as the mountain swept them away , the blaze of the disturbed fires called out the fire engines , otherwise more lives would have been lost .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 13]: Houses , stables , and sheds , were all hurled away together .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 12]: Horses , children , and women , rolled together in confusion .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 8]: One child had a very strange escape .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 40]: It had been forced out of its bed , and was found on the top of a huge mass of clay , weighing forty or fifty tons ; he was crying , and asking who had put him there .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 59]: Had all the inhabitants of the cottages been within , at least forty must have perished ; but notwithstanding the severity of the weather , the day being Sunday , they had all gone to evening meeting , and thus , being good Christians , they were for once rewarded for it on this side of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 53]: As I surveyed the busy scene below me , the gentleman who accompanied me to the summit of the mountain , informed me that forty-three years ago his father was the first settler , and that then there was but his one hut in the place where now stood the splendid town .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 10]: But signs of the times were manifest here also .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 22]: Commerce had stopped for the present , and a long line of canal boats was laid up for want of employment .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 12]: I remained two hours perched upon the top of the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 30]: I should not have staid so long , perhaps , had they not brought me a basket of cherries , so that I could gratify more senses than one .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 70]: I felt becomingly classical whilst sitting on the precise birth-place of Jupiter , attended by Pomona , with Troy at my feet , and Mount Olympus in the distance ; but I was obliged to descend to lumber and gin-slings , and I set off for Albany , where I had an engagement , having been invited to attend at the examination of the young ladies at the seminary .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 48]: Here again is a rivalry between Albany and Troy , each of them glorying in possessing the largest seminary for the education of young ladies , who are sent from every State of the Union , to be finished off at one or the other of them .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 29]: Here , and indeed in many other establishments , the young ladies now quitting it have diplomas given , to them , if they pass their examinations satisfactorily .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 31]: They are educated upon a system which would satisfy even Miss Martineau , and prepared to exercise the rights of which she complains that women have been so unjustly deprived .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 33]: Conceive three hundred modern Portias , who regularly take their degrees , and emerge from the portico of the seminary full of algebra , equality , and the theory of the constitution !
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 12]: The quantity and variety crammed into them is beyond all calculation .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 39]: The examination takes place yearly , to prove to the parents that the preceptors have , done their duty , and is in itself very innocent , as it only causes the young ladies to blush a little .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 15]: This afternoon they were examined in algebra , and their performance was very creditable .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 36]: Under a certain age girls are certainly much quicker than boys , and I presume would retain what they learnt if it were not for their subsequent duties in making puddings , and nursing babies .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 37]: Yet there are affairs which must be performed by one sex or the other , and of what use can algebra and other abstruse matters be to a woman in her present state of domestic thraldom .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 51]: The theory of the American constitution was the next subject on which they were examined ; by their replies , this appeared to be to them more abstruse than algebra : but the fact is , women are born tories , and admit no other than petticoat government as legitimate .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 31]: The next day we again repaired to the hall , and French was the language in which they were to be examined , and the examination afforded us much amusement .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 14]: The young ladies sat down in rows on one side of the room .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 48]: In the centre , towards the end , was an easel , on which was placed a large black board on which they worked with chalk the questions in algebra , etcetera , -- a towel hanging to it , that they might wipe out and correct .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 36]: The French preceptor , an old Emigre Count , sat down with the examiners before the board , the visitors -LRB- chiefly composed of anxious papas and mammas -RRB- being seated on benches behind them .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 32]: As it happened , I had taken my seat close to the examining board , and at some little distance from the other persons who were deputed or invited to attend .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 9]: I do n't knew how I came there .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 28]: I believe I had come in too late ; but there I was , within three feet of every young lady who came up to the board .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 21]: `` Now , messieurs , have the kindness to ask any question you please , '' said the old Count .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 13]: `` Mademoiselle , you will have the goodness to step forward . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 18]: A question was proposed in English , which the young lady had to write down in French .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 28]: The very first went wrong : I perceived it , and without looking at her , pronounced the right word , so that she could hear it .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 17]: She caught it , rubbed out the wrong word with the towel , and rectified it .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 23]: This was carried on through the whole sentence , and then she retreated from the board that her work might be examined .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 24]: `` Very well , very well , indeed , Miss , c'est parfaitement bien ; '' and the young lady sat down blushing .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 28]: Thus were they all called up , and one after another prompted by me ; and the old Count was delighted at the success of his pupils .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 36]: Now , what amused me in this was the little bit of human nature ; the _ tact _ displayed by the sex , which appears to be innate , and which never deserts them .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 40]: Had I prompted a boy , he would most likely have turned his head round towards me , and thus have revealed what I was about ; but not one of the whole class was guilty of such indiscretion .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 38]: They heard me , rubbed out , corrected , waited for the word when they did not know it , but never by any look or sign made it appear that there was any understanding between us .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 22]: Their eyes were constantly fixed on the board , and they appeared not to know that I was in the room .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 5]: It was really beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 28]: When the examination was over , I received a look from them all , half comic , half serious , which amply repaid me for my assistance .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 43]: As young ladies are assembled here from every State of the Union , it was a _ fair _ criterion of American beauty , and it must be acknowledged that the American women are the _ prettiest _ in the whole world .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 3]: Saratoga Springs .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 57]: -- Watering places all over the world are much alike : they must be well filled with company , and full of bustle , and then they answer the purpose for which they are intended -- a general muster , under the banner of folly , to drive care and common sense out of the field .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 55]: Like assembly-rooms , unless lighted up and full of people , they look desolate and forlorn : so it was with Saratoga : a beautiful spot , beautiful hotels , and beautiful water ; but all these beauties were thrown away , and the water ran away unheeded , because the place was empty .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 12]: People 's pockets were empty , and Saratoga was to let .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 41]: The consequence was that I remained a week there , and should have remained much longer had I not been warned , by repeated arrivals , that the visitors were increasing , and that I should be no longer alone .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 145]: The weariness of solitude , as described by Alexander Selkirk and the Anti-Zimmermanns , can surely not be equal to the misery of never being alone ; of feeling that your thoughts and ideas , rapidly accumulating , are in a state of chaos and confusion , and that you have not a moment to put them into any lucid order ; of finding yourself , against your will , continually in society , bandied from one person to the other , to make the same bows , extend the same hand to be grasped , and reply to the same eternal questions ; until , like a man borne down by sleep after long vigils , and at each moment roused to reply , you either are not aware of what you do say , or are dead beat into an unmeaning smile .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 53]: Since I have been in this country , I have suffered this to such a degree as at last to become quite nervous on the subject ; and I might reply in the words of the spirit summoned by Lochiel -- `` Now my weary lips I close ; Leave , oh !
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 6]: leave me to repose . ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 31]: It would be a strange account , had it been possible to keep one , of the number of introductions which I have had since I came into this country .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 81]: Mr A introduces Mr B and C , Mr B and C introduce Mr D , E , F , and G. Messrs. D , E , F , and G introduce Messrs. H , I , J , K , L , M , N , O , and so it goes on , _ ad infinitum _ during the whole of the day ; and this to me who never could remember either a face or a name .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 45]: At introduction it is invariably the custom to shake hands ; and thus you go on shaking hands here , there , and everywhere , and with everybody ; for it is impossible to know who is who , in this land of equality .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 51]: But one shake of the hand will not do ; if twenty times during the same day you meet a person to whom you have been introduced , the hand is every where extended with -- `` Well , captain , how do you find yourself by this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 29]: and , in their good-will , when they seize your hand , they follow the apothecary 's advice -- `` When taken , to be well shaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 15]: As for the constant query -- `` How do you like our country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 6]: -- that is natural enough .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 22]: I should ask the same of an American in England , but to reply to it is not the less tedious .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 20]: It is all well meant , all kindness , but it really requires fortitude and patience to endure it .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 26]: Every one throws in his voluntary tribute of compliments and good-will , but the accumulated mass is too great for any one individual to bear .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 13]: How I long for the ocean prairies , or the wild forests .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 28]: Subsequently , I begged hard to be shut up for six months in the Penitentiary at Philadelphia , but Sammy Wood said it was against the regulations .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 28]: He comforted me with a _ tete-a-tete _ dinner , which was so agreeable , that at the time I quite forgot I wished to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 43]: When I left Saratoga , I found no one , as I thought , in the car , who knew me ; and I determined , if possible , they should , in the Indian phrase , _ lose my trail _ .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 11]: I arrived at Schenectady , and was put down there .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 45]: I amused myself until the train started for Utica , which was to be in a few hours , in walking about the engine-house , and examining the locomotives ; and having satisfied myself , set out for a solitary walk in the country .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 24]: There was no name on my luggage , and I had not given my name when I took my ticket for the railroad .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 18]: `` At last , '' said I to myself , '' _ I am incog _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 58]: I had walked out of the engine-house , looked round the compass , and resolved in which direction I would bend my steps , when a young man came up to me , and very politely taking off his hat , said , `` I believe I have the pleasure of speaking to Captain M -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 14]: Had he known my indignation when he mentioned my name , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 15]: but there was no help for it , and I replied in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 17]: After apologising , he introduced himself , and then requested the liberty of introducing his friend .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 36]: `` Well , if ever , '' thought I ; and , `` no never , '' followed afterwards as a matter of course , and as a matter of course his friend was introduced .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 32]: It reminded me of old times , when , midshipmen at balls , we used to introduce each other to ladies we had none of us seen before in our lives .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 24]: Well , there I was , between two overpowering civilities , but they meant it kindly , and I could not be angry .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 14]: These were students of Schenectady College : would I like to see it ?
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 10]: a beautiful location , not half a mile off .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 38]: I requested to know if there was any thing to be seen there , as I did not like to take a hot walk for nothing , instead of the shady one I had proposed for myself .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 18]: `` Yes , there was Professor Nott '' -- I had of course heard of Professor Nott .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 25]: -- Professor Nott , who governed by moral influence and paternal sway , and who had written so largely on stones and anthracite coal .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 15]: I had never before heard of moral influence , stones , or anthracite coal .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 22]: Then there were more professors , and a cabinet of minerals -- the last was an inducement , and I went .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 19]: I saw Professor Nott , but not the cabinet of minerals , for Professor Savage had the key .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 22]: With Professor Nott I had rather a hot argument about anthracite coal , and then escaped before he was cool again .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 26]: The students walked back with me to the hotel , and , with many apologies for leaving me , informed me that dinner was ready .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 13]: I would not tax their politeness any longer , and they departed .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 44]: Schenectady College , like most of the buildings in America , was commenced on a grand scale , but has never been finished ; the two wings are finished , and the centre is lithographed , which looks very imposing in the plate .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 55]: There is a peculiarity in this college : it is called the Botany Bay , from its receiving young men who have been expelled from other colleges , and who are kept in order by moral influence and paternal sway , the only means certainly by which wild young men are to be reclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 28]: Seriously speaking Professor Nott is a very clever man , and I suspect this college will turn out more clever men than any other in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 10]: It differs from the other colleges in another point .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 15]: It upholds no peculiar sect of religion , which almost all the rest do .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 31]: For instance , Yule -LSB- Yale -RSB- , William 's Town , and Amherst Colleges , are under presbyterian influence ; Washington episcopal ; Cambridge , in Massachusets , unitarian .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 8]: There is one disadvantage generally attending railroads .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 15]: Travellers proceed more rapidly , but they lose all the beauty of the country .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 33]: Railroads of course run through the most level portions of the States ; and the levels , except they happen to be on the banks of a river , are invariably uninteresting .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 30]: The road from Schenectady to Utica is one of the exceptions to this rule : there is not perhaps a more beautiful variety of scenery to be found anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 21]: You run the whole way through the lovely valley of the Mohawk , on the banks of the Mohawk river .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 19]: It was really delightful , but the motion was so rapid that you lamented passing by so fast .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 35]: The Utica railroad is one of the best in America ; the eighty miles are performed in four hours and a-half , stoppages for taking in water , passengers , and refreshments , included .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 42]: The locomotive was of great power , and as it snorted along with a train of carriages of half a mile long in tow , it threw out such showers of fire , that we were constantly in danger of conflagration .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 54]: The weather was too warm to admit of the windows being closed , and the ladies , assisted by the gentlemen , were constantly employed in putting out the sparks which settled on their clothes -- the first time I ever heard ladies complain of having too many _ sparks _ about them .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 30]: As the evening closed in we actually were whirled along through a stream of fiery threads -- a beautiful , although humble imitation of the tail of a comet .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 20]: I had not been recognised in the rail car , and I again flattered myself that I was unknown .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 38]: I proceeded , on my arrival at Utica , to the hotel , and asking at the bar for a bed , the book was handed to me , and I was requested to write my name .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 46]: Wherever you stop in America , they generally produce a book and demand your name , not on account of any police regulations , but merely because they will not allow secrets in America , and because they choose to know who you may be .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 64]: Of course , you may frustrate this espionage by putting down any name you please ; and I had the pen in my hand , and was just thinking whether I should be Mr Snooks or Mr Smith , when I received a slap on the shoulder , accompanied with -- `` Well , captain , how are you by this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 26]: In despair I let the pen drop out of my hand , and instead of my name I left on the book a large blot .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 28]: It was an old acquaintance from Albany , and before I had been ten minutes in the hotel , I was recognised by at least ten more .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 31]: The Americans are such locomotives themselves , that it is useless to attempt the incognito in any part except the west side of the Missisippi , or the Rocky Mountains .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 31]: Once known at New York , and you are known every where , for in every place you will meet with some one whom you have met walking in Broadway .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 22]: A tremendous thunder-storm , with torrents of rain , prevented my leaving Utica for Trenton Falls until late in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 42]: The roads , ploughed up by the rain , were any thing but democratic ; there was no level in them ; and we were jolted and shaken like peas in a rattle , until we were silent from absolute suffering .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 9]: I rose the next morning at four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 22]: There was a heavy fog in the air , and you could not distinguish more than one hundred yards before you .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 32]: I followed the path pointed out to me the night before , through a forest of majestic trees , and descending a long flight of steps found myself below the Falls .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 45]: The scene impressed you with awe -- the waters roared through deep chasms , between two walls of rock , one hundred and fifty feet high , perpendicular on each side , and the width between the two varying from forty to fifty feet .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 24]: The high rocks were of black carbonate of lime in perfectly horizontal strata , so equally divided that they appeared like solid masonry .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 65]: For fifty or sixty feet above the rushing waters they were smooth and bare ; above that line vegetation commenced with small bushes , until you arrived at their summits , which were crowned with splendid forest trees , some of them inclining over the chasm , as if they would peep into the abyss below and witness the wild tumult of the waters .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 47]: From the narrowness of the pass , the height of the rocks , and the superadded towering of the trees above , but a small portion of the heavens was to be seen , and this was not blue , but of a misty murky grey .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 30]: The first sensation was that of dizziness and confusion , from the unusual absence of the sky above , and the dashing frantic speed of the angry boiling waters .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 48]: The rocks on each side have been blasted so as to form a path by which you may walk up to the first fall ; but this path was at times very narrow and you have to cling to the chain which is let into the rock .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 51]: The heavy storm of the day before had swelled the torrent so that it rose nearly a foot above this path ; and before I had proceeded far , I found that the flood swept between my legs with a force which would have taken some people off their feet .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 65]: The rapids below the Falls are much grander than the Falls themselves ; there was one down in a chasm between two riven rocks which it was painful to look long upon , and watch with what a deep plunge -- what irresistible force -- the waters dashed down and then returned to their own surface , as if struggling and out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 69]: As I stood over them in their wild career , listening to their roaring as if in anger , and watching the madness of their speed , I felt a sensation of awe -- an inward acknowledgment of the tremendous power of Nature ; and , after a time , I departed with feelings of gladness to escape from thought which became painful when so near to danger .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 25]: I gained the lower falls , which now covered the whole width of the rock , which they seldom do except during the freshets .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 7]: They were extraordinary from their variety .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 45]: On the side where I stood , poured down a rapid column of water about one-half of the width of the fall ; on the other , it was running over a clear thin stream , as gentle and amiable as water could be .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 38]: That part of the fall reminded me of ladies ' hair in flowing ringlets , and the one nearest me of the Lord Chancellor Eldon , in all the pomposity and frowning dignity of his full-bottomed wig .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 60]: And then I thought of the lion and the lamb , not lying down , but falling down together ; and then I thought that I was wet through , which was a fact ; so I climbed up a ladder , and came to a wooden bridge above the fall , which conveyed me to the other side .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 26]: The bridge posses over a staircase of little falls , sometimes diagonally , sometimes at right angles with the sites , and is very picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 29]: On the other side you climb up a ladder of one hundred feet , and arrive at a little building with a portico , where travellers are refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 25]: Here you have a view of all the upper falls , but these seem tame after witnessing the savage impetuosity of the rapids below .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 29]: You ascend another ladder of one hundred feet , and you arrive at a path pointed out to you by the broad chips of the woodman 's axe .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 24]: Follow the chips and you will arrive four or five hundred feet above both the bridge and the level of the upper fall .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 5]: This scene is splendid .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 95]: The black perpendicular rocks on the other side ; the succession of falls ; the rapids roaring below ; the forest trees rising to the clouds and spreading with their majestic boughs the vapour ascending from the falling waters ; together with the occasional glimpses of the skies here and there -- all this induces you to wander with your eyes from one point of view to another , never tiring with its beauty , wildness , and vastness : and , if you do not exclaim with the Mussulman , God is great !
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 17]: you _ feel _ it through every sense , and at every pulsation of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 30]: The mountain was still above me , and I continued my ascent ; but the chips now disappeared , and , like Tom Thumb , I lost my way .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 45]: I attempted to retreat , but in vain ; I was no longer amongst forest trees , but in a maze of young mountain ash , from which I could not extricate myself : so I stood still to think what I should do .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 29]: I recollected that the usual course of proceeding on such occasions , was either to sit down and cry , or attempt to get out of your scrape .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 44]: Tom Thumb did both ; but I had no time to indulge in the former luxury , so I pushed and pushed , till I pushed myself out of my scrape , and found myself in a more respectable part of the woods .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 7]: I then stopped to take breath .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 40]: I heard a rustling behind me , and made sure it was a panther : -- it was a beautiful little palm squirrel , who came close to me , as if to say `` Who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 36]: I took off my hat and told him my name , when , very contemptuously , as I thought , he turned short round , cocked his tail over his back , and skipped away .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 20]: `` Free , but not enlightened , '' thought I ; `` has n't a soul above nuts . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 66]: I also beat a retreat , and on my arrival at the hotel , found that , although I had no guides to pay , Nature had made a very considerable levy upon my wardrobe : my boots were bursting , my trowsers torn to fragments , and my hat was spoilt ; and , moreover , I sat shivering in the garments which remained .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 43]: So I , in my turn , levied upon a cow that was milking , and having improved her juice very much by the addition of some rum , I sat down under the portico , and smoked the cigar of meditation .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 20]: The walls of the portico were , as usual , scribbled over by those who would obtain cheap celebrity .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 13]: I always read these productions ; they are pages of human life .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 29]: The majority of the scribblers leave a name and nothing more : beyond that , some few of their productions are witty , some sententious , mostly gross .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 35]: My thoughts , as I read over the rubbish , were happily expressed by the following distich which I came to : -- Les Fenetres et les Murailles , Sont le papier des Canailles .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 48]: A little farther on , I found the lie given to this remark by some philosophic Spaniard : Amigo quien quiera que seas , piensa que si acqui Pones tu nombre , pronto il tiempo lo borrara Escribe lo pues en il libro de Dio en donde .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 6]: Permancera eternamente -- In Amigo .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 45]: Returning to Utica , I fell in with a horse bridled and saddled , that was taking his way home without his master , every now and then cropping the grass at the road-side , and then walking on in a most independent manner .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 30]: His master had given him a certificate of leave , by chalking in large letters on the saddle-flaps on each side , '' _ Let him go _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 41]: This was a very primitive proceeding ; but I am not quite sure that it could be ventured upon in Yorkshire , or in Virginia either , where they know a good horse , and are particularly careful of it .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 17]: It is a fact , that wherever they breed horses they invariably learn to steal them .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 36]: Set off for Oswego in a canal boat ; it was called a packet-boat because it did not carry merchandise , but was a very small affair , about fifty feet long by eight wide .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 29]: The captain of her was , however , in his own opinion , no small affair ; he puffed and swelled until he looked larger than his boat .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 83]: This personage , as soon as we were under weigh , sat down in the narrow cabin , before a small table ; sent for this writing-desk , which was about the size of street organ , and , like himself , no small affair ; ordered a bell to be rung in our ears to summon the passengers ; and , then , taking down the names of four or five people , received the enormous sum of ten dollars passage-money .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 34]: He then locked his desk with a key large enough for a street-door , ordered his steward to remove it , and went on deck to walk just three feet and return again .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 11]: After all , there is nothing like being a captain .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 18]: Although many of the boats are laid up , there is still considerable traffic on this canal .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 23]: We passed Rome , a village of two thousand inhabitants , at which number it has for many years been nearly stationary .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 76]: This branch of the canal is , of course , cut through the levels , and we passed through swamps and wild forests ; here and there some few acres were cleared , and a log-house was erected , looking very solitary and forlorn , surrounded by the stumps of the trees which had been felled , and which now lay corded up on the banks of the canal , ready to be disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 55]: Wild and dreary as the country is , the mass of forest is gradually receding , and occasionally some solitary tree is left standing , throwing out its wide arms , and appearing as if in lamentation at its separation from its companions , with whom for centuries it had been in close fellowship .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 71]: Extremes meet : as I looked down from the roof of the boat upon the giants of the forest , which had for so many centuries reared their heads undisturbed , but now lay prostrate before civilisation , the same feelings were conjured up in my mind as when I have , in my wanderings , surveyed such fragments of dismembered empires as the ruins of Carthage or of Rome .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 31]: There the reign of Art was over , and Nature had resumed her sway -- here Nature was deposed , and about to resign her throne to the usurper Art .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 21]: By the bye , the mosquitoes of this district have reaped some benefit from the cutting of the canal here .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 64]: Before these impervious forest retreats were thus pierced , they could not have tasted human blood ; for ages it must have been unknown to them , even by tradition ; and if they taxed all other boats on the canal as they did , ours , a _ canal share _ with them must be considerably above par , and highly profitable .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 8]: At five o'clock we arrived at Syracuse .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 9]: I do detest these old names vamped up .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 10]: Why do not the Americans take the Indian names ?
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 19]: They need not be so very scrupulous about it ; they have robbed the Indians of everything else .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 15]: After you pass Syracuse , the country wears a more populous and inviting appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 69]: Salina is a village built upon a salt spring , which has the greatest flow of water yet known , and this salt spring is the cause of the improved appearance of the country ; the banks of the canal , for three miles , are lined with buildings for the boiling down of the salt water , which is supplied by a double row of wooden pipes .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 19]: Boats are constantly employed up and down the canal , transporting wood for the supply of the furnaces .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 55]: It is calculated that two hundred thousand cord of wood are required every year for the present produce ; and as they estimate upon an average about sixty cord of wood per acre in these parts , those salt works are the means of yearly clearing away upwards of three thousand acres of land .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 37]: Two million of bushels of salt are boiled down every year : it is packed in barrels , and transported by the canals and lakes to Canada , Michigan , Chicago , and the far West .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 61]: When we reflect upon the number of people employed in the manufactories , and in cutting wood , and making barrels , and engaged on the lakes and canals in transporting the produce so many thousand miles , we must admire the spring to industry which has been created by this little , but bounteous , spring presented by nature .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 79]: The first sixty miles of this canal -LRB- I get on very slow with my description , but canal travelling is very slow -RRB- , which is through a flat swampy forest , is without a lock ; but after you pass Syracuse , you have to descend by locks to the Oswego river , and the same at every rapid of the river ; in all , there is a fall of one hundred and sixty feet .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 37]: Simple as locks are , I could not help reverting to the wild rapids at Trenton Falls , and reflecting upon how the ingenuity of man had so easily been able to overcome and control Nature !
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 15]: The locks did not detain us long -- they never lose time in America .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 36]: When the boat had entered the lock , and the gate was closed upon her , the water was let off with a rapidity which considerably affected her level , and her bows pointed downwards .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 11]: I timed one lock with a fall of fifteen feet .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 50]: From the time the gate was closed behind us until the lower one was opened for our egress , was exactly one minute and a quarter ; and the boat sank down in the lock so rapidly as to give you the idea that she was scuttled and sinking .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 26]: The country round the Oswego is fertile and beautiful , and the river , with its islands , falls , and rapids , very picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 69]: At one p.m. we arrived at the town of Oswego , on Lake Ontario ; I was pleased with the journey , although , what with ducking to bridges , bites from mosquitoes , and the constant blowing of their unearthly horn with only one note , and which one must have been borrowed from the gamut of the infernal regions , I had had enough of it .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 29]: For the first time since my arrival in the country , no one -- that is to say , on board the canal-boat -- knew who I was .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 25]: As we tracked above the Oswego river , I fell into conversation with a very agreeable person , who had joined us at Syracuse .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 32]: We conversed the whole day , and I obtained much valuable information from him about the country : when we parted , he expressed a wish that we should meet again .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 76]: He gave me his name and address , and when I gave my card in return , he looked at it , and then said , `` I am most happy to make your acquaintance , sir ; but I will confess that had I known with whom I had been conversing , I should not have _ spoken so freely _ upon certain points connected with the government and institutions of this country . ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 24]: This was American all over ; they would conceal the truth , and then blame us because we do not find it out .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 17]: I met him afterwards , but he never would enter into any detailed conversation with me .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 3]: Niagara Falls .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 76]: -- Perhaps the wisest , if not the best description of the Falls of Niagara , is in the simple ejaculation of Mrs Butler ; for it is almost useless to attempt to describe when you feel that language fails ; but if the falls can not be described , the ideas which are conjured up in the mind , when we contemplate this wonderful combination of grandeur and beauty , are often worth recording .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 14]: The lines of Mrs Sigourney , the American poetess , please me most .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 32]: Flow on for ever , in thy glorious robe Of terror and of beauty ; God hath set His rainbow on thy forehead , and the cloud Mantles around thy feet .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 34]: And he doth give Thy voice of thunder power to speak of him Eternally -- bidding the lip of man Keep silence , and upon thy rocky altar pour Incense of awe-struck praise .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 21]: When the Indian first looked upon the falls , he declared them to be the dwelling of the Great Spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 42]: The savage could not imagine that the Great Spirit dwelt also in the leaf which he bruised in his hand ; but here it appealed to his senses in thunder and awful majesty , and he was compelled to acknowledge it .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 25]: The effects which the contemplation of these glorious waters produce , are of course very different , according to one 's temperament and disposition .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 114]: As I stood on the brink above the falls , continuing for a considerable time to watch the great mass of water tumbling , dancing , capering , and rushing wildly along , as if in a hurry to take the leap and , delighted at it , I could not help wishing that I too had been made of such stuff as would have enabled me to have joined it ; with it to have rushed innocuously down the precipice ; to have rolled uninjured into the deep unfathomable gulf below , or to have gambolled in the atmosphere of spray , which rose again in a dense cloud from its recesses .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 55]: For about half an hour more I continued to watch the rolling waters , and then I felt a slight dizziness and a creeping sensation come over me -- that sensation arising from strong excitement , and the same , probably , that occasions the bird to fall into the jaws of the snake .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 29]: This is a feeling which , if too long indulged in , becomes irresistible , and occasions a craving desire to leap into the flood of rushing waters .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 32]: It increased upon me every minute ; and retreating from the brink , I turned my eyes to the surrounding foliage , until the effect of the excitement had passed away .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 21]: I looked upon the waters a second time , and then my thoughts were directed into a very different channel .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 52]: I wished myself a magician , that I might transport the falls to Italy , and pour their whole volume of waters into the crater of Mount Vesuvius ; witness the terrible conflict between the contending elements , and create the largest steam-boiler that ever entered into the imagination of man .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 42]: I have no doubt that the opinion that these falls have receded a distance of seven miles is correct ; but what time must have passed before even this tremendous power could have sawed away such a mass of solid rock !
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 17]: Within the memory of man it has receded but a few feet -- changed but little .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 28]: How many thousand years must these waters have been flowing and falling , unvarying in their career , and throwing up their sheets of spray to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 48]: It is impossible for either the eye or the mind to compass the whole mass of falling water ; you can not measure , can not estimate its enormous volume ; and this is the reason , perhaps , why travellers often express themselves disappointed by it .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 114]: But fix your eye upon one portion -- one falling and heaving wave out of the millions , as they turn over the edge of the rocks ; watch , I say , this fragment for a few minutes , its regular time-beating motion never varying or changing ; pursuing the laws of nature with a regularity never ceasing and never tiring ; minute after minute ; hour after hour ; day after day ; year after year , until time recedes into creation : then cast your eyes over the whole multitudinous mass which is , and has been , performing the same and coeval duty , and you feel its vastness !
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 25]: Still the majesty of the whole is far too great for the mind to compass -- too stupendous for its limited powers of reception .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 2]: Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 70]: -- I had intended to have passed the whole day at the Falls ; but an old gentleman whose acquaintance I had made in the steam boat on Lake Ontario , asked me to go to church ; and as I felt he would be annoyed if I did not , I accompanied him to a Presbyterian meeting not far from the Falls , which sounded like distant thunder .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 32]: The sermon was upon temperance -- a favourite topic in America ; and the minister rather quaintly observed , that `` alcohol was not sealed by the hand of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 46]: It was astonishing to me that he did not allude to the Falls , point out that the seal of God was there , and shew how feeble was the voice of man when compared to the thunder of the Almighty so close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 70]: But the fact was , he had been accustomed to preach every Sunday with the Falls roaring in his ear , and -LRB- when the wind was in a certain quarter , -RRB- with the spray damping the leaves of his sermon : he therefore did not feel as we did , and , no doubt , thought his sermon better than that from the God of the elements .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 93]: Yes , it is through the elements that the Almighty has ever deigned to commune with man , or to execute his supreme will , whether it has been by the wild waters to destroy an impious race -- by the fire hurled upon the doomed cities -- by seas divided , that the chosen might pass through them -- by the thunders on Sinai 's Mount when his laws were given to man -- by the pillar of fire or the gushing rock , or by the rushing of mighty winds .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 36]: And it is still through the elements that the Almighty speaks to man , to warn , to terrify , to chasten ; to raise him up to wonder , to praise , and adore .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 148]: The forked and blinding lightning which , with the rapidity of thought , dissolves the union between the body and the soul ; the pealing thunder , announcing that the bolt has sped ; the fierce tornado , sweeping away everything in its career , like a besom of wrath ; the howling storm ; the mountain waves ; the earth quaking , and yawning wide , in a second overthrowing the work and pride of centuries , and burying thousands in a living tomb ; the fierce vomiting of the crater , pouring out its flames of liquid fire , and changing fertility to the arid rock : it is through these that the Deity still speaks to man ; yet what can inspire more awe of him , more reverence , and more love , than the contemplation of thy falling waters , great Niagara !
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 28]: Two gentlemen have left their cards , and will be happy to see me on my route ; one lives at Batavia , the other at Pekin .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 35]: I recollect going over the ferry to Brooklyn to visit the Commodore at the Navy Yard ; I walked to where the omnibuses started from , to see if one was going my way .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 23]: There were but two on the stand : one was bound to _ Babylon _ , the other to _ Jericho _ .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 9]: Buffalo is one of the wonders of America .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 24]: It is hardly to be credited that such a beautiful city could have risen up in the wilderness in so short a period .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 33]: In the year 1814 it was burnt down , being then only a village ; only one house was left standing , and now it is a city with twenty-five thousand inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 39]: The Americans are very judicious in planning their new towns ; the streets are laid out so wide that there will never be any occasion to pull down to widen and improve , as we do in England .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 29]: The city of Buffalo is remarkably well built ; all the houses in the principal streets are lofty and substantial , and are either of brick or granite .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 20]: The main street is wider , and the stores handsomer , than the majority of those in New York .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 60]: It has five or six very fine churches , a handsome theatre , town-hall , and market , and three or four hotels , one of which is superior to most others in America ; and to these we must add a fine stone pier , with a lighthouse , and a harbour full of shipping and magnificent steam-boats .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 17]: It is almost incomprehensible , that all this should have been accomplished since the year 1814 .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 25]: And what has occasioned this springing up of a city in so short a time as to remind you of Aladdin 's magic palace ?
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 27]: -- the Erie Canal , which here joins the Hudson River with the Lake , passing through the centre of the most populous and fertile States .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 45]: At present , however , the business of Buffalo , as well as of every other city , is nearly at a stand-still ; the machinery of America is under repair , and until that repair is completed , the country will remain paralysed .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 25]: America may just now be compared to one of her own steamboats , which , under too high pressure , has burst her boiler .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 59]: Some of her passengers have -LRB- in a commercial point of view -RRB- been killed outright , others severely injured , and her progress has for a time been stopped : but she will soon be enabled to go a-head again as fast as ever , and will then probably pay a little more attention to her safety-valve .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 41]: I went out to the Indian reservation , granted to the remnant of the Seneca tribe of Indians , once a portion of the Mohawks , and all that now remains in the United States of the famed six nations .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 22]: The chief of them -LRB- Red Jacket -RRB- , lately dead , might be considered as the last of the Mohicans .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 44]: I had some conversation with his daughter , who was very busily employed in the ornamenting of a pair of mocassins , and then visited the tomb , or rather the spot , where her father was buried , without name or record .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 17]: This omission has since been repaired , and a tablet is now raised over his grave .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 28]: It is creditable to the profession that the `` poor player , '' as Shakespeare hath it , should be the foremost to pay tribute to worth .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 71]: Cooke , the tragedian , was lying without a stone to mark his resting-place , when Kean came to America , found out the spot , and raised a handsome cenotaph to his memory ; and it is to Mr Placide , one of the very best of American actors , that Red Jacket is indebted for the tablet which has been raised to rescue his narrow home from oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 40]: Red Jacket was a great chief and a great man , but , like most of the Indians , he could not resist the temptations of alcohol , and was during the latter part of his life very intemperate .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 79]: When Red Jacket was sober , he was the proudest chief that ever walked , and never would communicate even with the highest of the American authorities but through his interpreter ; but when intoxicated , he would speak English and French fluently , and then the proud Indian warrior , the most eloquent of his race , the last chief of the six nations , would demean himself by begging for a sixpence to buy more rum .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 52]: I must now revert to the singular causes by which , independent of others , such as locality , etcetera , Buffalo was so rapidly brought to a state of perfection -- not like many other towns which , commencing with wooden houses , gradually supersede them by brick and stone .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 27]: The person who was the cause of this unusual rise was a Mr Rathbun , who now lies incarcerated in a gaol of his own building .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 40]: It was he who built all the hotels , churches , and other public edifices ; in fact , every structure worthy of observation in the whole town was projected , contracted for , and executed by Mr Rathbun .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 5]: His history is singular .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 59]: Of quiet , unassuming manners , Quaker in his dress , moderate in all his expenses , -LRB- except in charity , wherein , assisted by an amiable wife , he was very liberal -RRB- he concealed under this apparent simplicity and goodness a mind capable of the vastest conceptions , united with the greatest powers of execution .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 16]: He undertook contracts , and embarked in building speculations , to an amount almost incredible .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 15]: Rathbun undertook every thing , and every thing undertaken by Rathbun was well done .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 39]: Not only at Buffalo , but at Niagara and other places , he was engaged in raising vast buildings , when the great crash occurred , and Rathbun , with others , was unable to meet his liabilities .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 58]: Then , for the first time , it was discovered that for more than five years he had been conniving at a system of forgery , to the amount of two millions of dollars : the forgery consisted in putting to his bills the names of responsible parties as indorsers , that they might be more current .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 48]: It does not appear that he ever intended to defraud , for he took up all his notes as fast as they became due ; and it was this extreme regularity on his part which prevented the discovery of his fraud for so unusually long a period .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 40]: It is surmised , that had not the general failure taken place , he would have eventually withdrawn all these forged bills from the market , and have paid all his creditors , reserving for himself a handsome fortune .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 25]: It is a singular event in the annals of forgery , that this should have been carried on undiscovered for so unprecedented a time .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 20]: Mr Rathbun is to be tried as an accessory , as it was his brother who forged the names .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 30]: As soon as it was discovered , the latter made his escape , and he is said to have died miserably in a hovel on the confines of Texas .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 10]: Embarked on board of the Sandusky , for Detroit .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 41]: As we were steering clear of the pier , a small brig of about two hundred tons burthen was pointed out to me as having been the _ flag-ship _ of Commodore Barclay , in the action upon Lake Erie .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 11]: The appearance of Buffalo from the Lake is very imposing .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 10]: Stopped at Dunkirk to put some emigrants on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 24]: As they were landing , I watched them carefully counting over their little property , from the iron tea-kettle to the heavy chest .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 27]: It was their whole fortune , and invaluable to them ; the nest-egg by which , with industry , their children were to rise to affluence .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 22]: They remained on the wharf as we shoved off , and no wonder that they seemed embarrassed and at a loss .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 59]: There was the baby in the cradle , the young children holding fast to their mother 's skirt , while the elder had seated themselves on a log , and watched the departure of the steam-vessel ; -- the bedding , cooking utensils , etcetera , all lying in confusion , and all to be housed before night .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 26]: Weary did they look , and weary indeed they were , and most joyful would they be when they at last should gain their resting-place .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 49]: It appears from the reports sent in , that upwards of 100,000 emigrants pass to the west every year by the route of the Lakes , of which it is estimated that about 30,000 are from Europe , the remainder migrating from the eastern States of the Union .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 7]: I may keep a log now .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 18]: -- 5 AM Light breezes and clear weather , land trending from South to South South West .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 6]: Five sail in the offing .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 9]: At 6 AM , ran into Grand River .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 21]: Within these last two years , three towns have sprung up here , containing between them about three thousand inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 50]: How little are they aware , in Europe , of the vastness and extent of commerce carried on in these inland seas whose coasts are now lined with flourishing towns and cities , and whose waters are ploughed by magnificent steam-boats , and hundreds of vessels laden with merchandise .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 21]: Even the Americans themselves are not fully aware of the rising importance of these Lakes as connected with the West .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 26]: Since the completion of the Ohio Canal , which enters the Lake Erie at Cleveland , that town has risen almost as rapidly as Buffalo .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 5]: It is beautifully situated .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 27]: It is about six years back that it may be said to have commenced its start , and it now contains more than ten thousand inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 78]: The buildings are upon the same scale as those of Buffalo , and it is conjectured with good reason , that it will become even a larger city than the other , as the ice breaks up here and the navigation is open in the spring , six weeks sooner than it is at Buffalo ; abreast of which town the ice is driven down and collected , previous to its forcing its passage over the falls .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 34]: Erie , which was the American naval depot during the war , has a fine bay , but it is now falling into insignificance : it has a population of about one thousand .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 28]: Sandusky is a fast-rising town , beautifully situated upon the verge of a small prairie ; it is between Sandusky and Huron that the prairie lands commence .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 15]: The bay of Sandusky is very picturesque , being studded with small verdant islands .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 36]: On one of these are buried in the same grave all those who fell in the hard-fought battle of the Lakes , between Perry and Barclay , both of whom have since followed their companions .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 11]: Toledo is the next town of consequence on the Lake .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 42]: It is situated at the mouth of the Miami River ; and as a railroad has already been commenced across the isthmus , so as to avoid going round the whole peninsula of Michigan , it is fast rising into importance .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 30]: Three years ago the land was purchased at a dollar and a-half per acre ; now , it is selling for building lots at one hundred dollars per foot .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 57]: They handed me a paper printed in this town called `` The Toledo Blade ; '' a not inappropriate title , though rather a bold one for an editor to write up to , as his writings ought to be very _ sharp _ , and , at the same time , extremely _ well-tempered _ .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 12]: The American government have paid every attention to their inland waters .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 37]: The harbours , light-houses , piers , etcetera , have all been built at the expense of government , and every precaution has been taken to make the navigation of the Lakes as safe as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 41]: In speaking of the new towns rising so fast in America , I wish the reader to understand that , if he compares them with the country towns of the same population in England , he will not do them .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 54]: In the smaller towns of England you can procure but little , and you have to send to London for any thing good : in the larger towns , such as Norwich , etcetera , you may procure most things ; but , still , luxuries must usually be obtained from the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 25]: But in such places as Buffalo and Cleveland , every thing is to be had that you can procure at New York or Boston .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 50]: In those two towns on Lake Erie are stores better furnished , and handsomer , than any shops at Norwich , in England ; and you will find , in either of them , articles for which , at Norwich , you would be obliged to send to London .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 17]: It is the same thing at almost every town in America with which communication is easy .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 59]: Would you furnish a house in one of them , you will find every article of furniture -- carpets , stoves , grates , marble chimney-pieces , pier-glasses , pianos , lamps , candelabra , glass , china , etcetera , in twice the quantity , and in greater variety , than at any provincial town in England .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 80]: This arises from the system of credit extended through every vein and artery of the country , and by which English goods are forced , as if with a force-pump , into every available depot in the Union ; and thus , in a town so newly raised , that the stumps of the forest-trees are not only still surrounding the houses , but remain standing in the cellars , you will find every luxury that can be required .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 11]: It may be asked what becomes of all these goods .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 27]: It must be recollected that hundreds of new houses spring up every year in the towns , and that the surrounding country is populous and wealthy .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 24]: In the farmhouses -- mean-looking and often built of logs -- is to be found not only comfort , but very often luxury .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 24]: The French never have succeeded as colonists , and their want of success can only be ascribed to an amiable want of energy .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 46]: When located at any spot , if a Frenchman has enough , he seeks no more ; and , instead of working as the Englishman or the American does , he will pass his time away , and spend his little surplus in social amusements .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 40]: The town of Detroit was founded as early as the city of Philadelphia , but , favourably as it is situated , it never until lately rose to any thing more than , properly speaking , a large village .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 17]: There is not a paved street in it , or even a foot-path for a pedestrian .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 40]: In winter , in rainy weather , you are up to your knees in mud ; in summer , invisible from dust : indeed , until lately , there was not a practicable road for thirty miles round Detroit .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 23]: The muddy and impassable state of the streets has given rise to a very curious system of making morning or evening calls .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 64]: A small one-horse cart is backed against the door of a house ; the ladies dressed get into it , and seat themselves upon a buffalo skin at the bottom of it ; they are carried to the residence of the party upon whom they wish to call ; the cart is backed in again , and they are landed dry and clean .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 29]: An old inhabitant of Detroit complained to me that people were now getting so proud , that many of them refused to visit in that way any longer .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 71]: But owing to the rise of the other towns on the lake , the great increase of commerce , and Michigan having been admitted as a State into the Union , with Detroit as its capital , a large Eastern population has now poured into it , and Detroit will soon present an appearance very different from its present , and become one of the most flourishing cities of America .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 16]: Within these last six years it has increased its population from two to ten thousand .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 17]: The climate here is the very best in America , although the State itself is unhealthy .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 8]: The land near the town is fertile .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 33]: A railroad from Detroit already extends thirty miles through the State ; and now that the work has commenced , it will be carried on with the usual energy of the Americans .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 57]: Left Detroit in the Michigan steam-vessel for Mackinaw ; passed through the Lake St Clair , and entered Lake Huron ; stopped at a solitary wharf to take in wood , and met there with a specimen of American politeness or -LRB- if you please -RRB- independence in the gentleman who cut down and sold it .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 39]: Without any assignable motive , he called out to me , `` You are a damned fool of an Englishman ; '' for which , I suppose , I ought to have been very much obliged to him .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 13]: Miss Martineau has not been too lavish in her praises of Mackinaw .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 50]: It has the appearance of a fairy isle floating on the water , which is so pure and transparent that you may see down to almost any depth ; and the air above is as pure as the water , so that you feel invigorated as you breathe it .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 42]: The first reminiscence brought to my mind after I had landed , was the description by Walter Scott of the island and residence of Magnus Troil and his daughters Minna and Brenda , in the novel of the `` Pirate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 115]: The low buildings , long stores , and out-houses full of nets , barrels , masts , sails , and cordage ; the abundance of fish lying about ; the rafters of the houses laden with dried and smoked meat ; and the full and jolly proportions of most of the inhabitants , who would have rivalled Scott 's worthy in height and obesity , immediately struck my eye ; and I might have imagined myself transported to the Shetland isle , had it not been for the lodges of the Indians on the beach , and the Indians themselves either running about , or lying stripped in the porches before the whisky stores .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 50]: I inquired of one of the islanders , why all the white residents were generally such large portly men , which they are at a very early age ; he replied , `` We have good air , good water , and what we eat agrees with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 5]: This was very conclusive .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 49]: I enquired of another , if people lived to a good old age in the island ; his reply was quite American -- `` I guess they do ; if people want to die , they ca n't die here -- they 're obliged to go elsewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 31]: Wandering among the Indian lodges -LRB- wigwams is a term not used now-a-days -RRB- , I heard a sort of flute played in one of them , and I entered .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 14]: The young Indian who was blowing on it , handed it to me .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 26]: It was an imperfect instrument , something between a flute and a clarionet , but the sound which it gave out was soft and musical .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 38]: An islander informed me that it was the only sort of musical instrument which the Northern tribes possessed , and that it was played upon by the young men only when they were _ in love _ .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 21]: I suspected at first that he was bantering me , but I afterwards found that what he said was true .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 29]: The young Indian must have been very deeply smitten , for he continued to play all day and all night , during the time that I was there .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 13]: `` If music be the food of love , play on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 33]: Started in a birch canoe for Sault St Marie , a small town built under the rapids of that name , which pour out a portion of the waters of Lake Superior .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 25]: Two American gentlemen , one a member of Congress , and the other belonging to the American Fur Company , were of the party .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 21]: Our crew consisted of five Canadian half-breeds -- a mixture between the Indian and the white , which spoils both .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 66]: It was a lovely morning ; not a breath of air stirred the wide expanse of the Huron , as far as the eye could scan ; and the canoe , as it floated along side of the landing-place , appeared as if it were poised in the air , so light did it float , and so clear and transparent are these northern waters .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 24]: We started , and in two hours arrived at Goose Island , unpoetical in its name , but in itself full of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 46]: As you stand on the beach , you can look down through the water on to the shelving bottom , bright with its variety of pebbles , and trace it almost as far off as if it had not been covered with water at all .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 44]: The island was small , but gay as the gayest of parterres , covered with the sweet wild rose in full bloom -LRB- certainly the most fragrant rose in the world -RRB- , blue campanellos , yellow exeranthemums , and white ox-eyed daisies .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 34]: Underneath there was a perfect carpet of strawberries , ripe , and inviting you to eat them , which we did , while our Canadian brutes swallowed long strings of raw salt pork .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 48]: And yet , in two months hence , this lovely little spot will be but one mass of snow -- a mound rising above to serve as a guide to the chilled traveller who would find his way over the frozen expanse of the wide Huron Lake .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 46]: As soon as our Canadians had filled themselves to repletion with raw pork , we continued our route that we might cross the lake and gain the detour , or point which forms the entrance of the river St Marie , before it was dark .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 23]: We arrived a little before sunset , when we landed , put up our light boat , and bivouacked for the night .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 19]: As soon as we put our feet on shore , we were assailed by the mosquitoes in myriads .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 34]: They congregated from all quarters in such numbers , that you could only see as if through a black veil , and you could not speak without having your mouth filled with them .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 25]: But in ten minutes we had a large fire , made , not of logs or branches , but of a dozen small trees .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 43]: The wind eddied , and the flame and smoke , as they rose in masses , whirled about the mosquitoes right and left , and in every quarter of the compass , until they were fairly beaten off to a respectable distance .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 23]: We supped upon lake-trout and fried ham ; and rolling ourselves up in our Mackinaw blankets , we were soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 11]: There was no occasion to call us the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 14]: The Canadians were still snoring , and had let the fires go down .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 54]: The mosquitoes , taking advantage of this neglect , had forced their way into the tent , and sounded the reveille in our ears with their petty trumpets ; following up the summons with the pricking of pins , as the fairies of Queen Mab are reported to have done to lazy housemaids .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 37]: We kicked up our half-breeds , who gave us our breakfast , stowed away the usual quantity of raw pork , and once more did we float on the water in a piece of birch bark .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 63]: The heat of the sun was oppressive , and we were broiled ; but we dipped our hands in the clear cool stream as we skimmed along , listening to the whistling of the solitary loon as it paddled away from us , or watching the serrated back of the sturgeon , as he rolled lazily over and showed above the water .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 32]: Now and then we stopped , and the silence of the desert was broken by the report of our fowling-pieces , and a pigeon or two was added to our larder .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 35]: At noon a breeze sprung up , and we hoisted our sail , and the Canadians who had paddled dropped asleep as we glided quietly along under the guidance of the `` timonier . ''
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 24]: After you have passed through the river St Clair , and entered the Huron lake , the fertility of the country gradually disappears .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 46]: Here and there indeed , especially on the Canadian side , a spot more rich than the soil in general is shewn by the large growth of the timber ; but the northern part of the Lake Huron shores is certainly little fit for cultivation .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 33]: The spruce fir now begins to be plentiful ; for , until you come to the upper end of the lake , they are scarce , although very abundant in Upper Canada .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 31]: The country wears the same appearance all the way up to the Sault St Marie , shewing maple and black poplar intermingled with fir : the oak but rarely appearing .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 13]: The whole lake from Mackinaw to the Detour is studded with islands .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 15]: A large one at the entrance of the river is called St Joseph 's .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 35]: The Hudson Bay Company had a station there , which is now abandoned , and the island has been purchased , or granted , to an English officer , who has partly settled it .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 19]: It is said to be the best land in this region , but still hardly fit for cultivation .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 28]: It was late before our arrival at the Sault , and we were obliged to have recourse to our paddles , for the wind had died away .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 35]: As the sun went down , we observed a very curious effect from the refraction of tints , the water changing to a bright violet every time that it was disturbed by the paddles .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 15]: I have witnessed something like this just after sunset on the Lake of Geneva .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 39]: We landed at dusk , much fatigued ; but the Aurora Borealis flashed in the heavens , spreading out like a vast plume of ostrich feathers across the sky , every minute changing its beautiful and fanciful forms .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 22]: Tired as we were , we watched it for hours before we could make up our minds to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 12]: Sault St Marie -- Our landlord is a very strange being .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 42]: It appears that he has been annoyed by some traveller , who has published a work in which he has found fault with the accommodations at Sault St Marie , and spoken very disrespectfully of our host 's beds and bed-furniture .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 87]: I have never read the work , but I am so well aware how frequently travellers fill up their pages with fleas , and `` such small gear , '' that I presume the one in question was short of matter to furnish out his book ; yet it was neither just nor liberal on his part to expect at Sault St Marie , where , perhaps , not five travellers arrive in the course of a year , the same accommodations as at New York .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 17]: The bedsteads certainly were a little rickety , but every thing was very clean and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 82]: The house was not an inn , nor , indeed , did it pretend to be one , but the fare was good and well cooked , and you were waited upon by the host 's two pretty modest daughters -- not only pretty , but well-informed girls ; and , considering that this village is the Ultima Thule of this portion of America , I think that a traveller might have been very well content with things as they were .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 20]: In two instances , I found in the log-houses of this village complete editions of Lord Byron 's works .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 29]: Sault St Marie contains , perhaps , fifty houses , mostly built of logs , and has a palisade put up to repel any attack of the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 9]: There are two companies of soldiers quartered here .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 31]: The rapids from which the village takes its name are just above it ; they are not strong or dangerous , and the canoes descend them twenty times a day .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 32]: At the foot of the rapids the men are constantly employed in taking the white fish in scoop nets , as they attempt to force their way up into Lake Superior .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 9]: The majority of the inhabitants here are half-breeds .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 20]: It is remarkable that the females generally improve , and the males degenerate , from the admixture of blood .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 50]: Indian wives are here preferred to white , and perhaps with reason -- they make the best wives for poor men ; they labour hard , never complain , and a day of severe toil is amply recompensed by a smile from their lord and master in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 28]: They are always faithful and devoted , and very sparing of their talk , all which qualities are considered as recommendations in this part of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 45]: It is remarkable , that although the Americans treat the negro with contumely , they have a respect for the red Indian : a well-educated half-bred Indian is not debarred from entering into society ; indeed , they are generally received with great attention .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 38]: The daughter of a celebrated Indian chief brings heraldry into the family , for the Indians are as proud of their descent -LRB- and with good reason -RRB- as we , in Europe , are of ours .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 31]: The Randolph family in Virginia still boast of their descent from Pocahontas , the heroine of one of the most remarkable romances in real life which was ever heard of .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 27]: The whole of this region appears to be incapable of cultivation , and must remain in its present state , perhaps , for centuries to come .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 29]: The chief produce is from the lakes ; trout and white fish are caught in large quantities , salted down , and sent to the west and south .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 86]: At Mackinaw alone they cure about two thousand barrels , which sell for ten dollars the barrel ; at the Sault , about the same quantity ; and on Lake Superior , at the station of the American Fur Company , they have commenced the fishing , to lessen the expenses of the establishment , and they now salt down about four thousand barrels ; but this traffic is still in its infancy , and will become more profitable as the west becomes more populous .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 34]: Be it here observed that , although the Canadians have the same rights and the same capabilities of fishing , I do not believe that one barrel is cured on the Canadian side .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 25]: As the American fish is prohibited in England , it might really become an article of exportation from the Canadas to a considerable amount .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 31]: There is another source of profit , which is the collecting of the maple sugar ; and this staple , if I may use the term , is rapidly increasing .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 29]: At an average , the full grown maple-tree will yield about five pounds of sugar each tapping , and , if carefully treated , will last forty years .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 24]: All the State of Michigan is supplied from this quarter with this sugar , which is good in quality , and refines well .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 12]: At Mackinaw they receive about three hundred thousand pounds every year .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 39]: It may be collected in any quantity from their vast wildernesses of forests , and although the notion may appear strange , it is not impossible that one day the Northern sugar may supersede that of the Tropics .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 29]: The island of St Joseph , which I have mentioned , is covered with large maple trees , and they make a great quantity upon that spot alone .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 15]: I was amused by a reply given me by an American in office here .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 22]: I asked how much his office was worth , and his answer was six hundred dollars , besides _ stealings _ .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 23]: This was , at all events , frank and honest ; in England the word would have been softened down to perquisites .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 23]: I afterwards found that it was a common expression in the States to say a place was worth so much besides cheatage .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 47]: In all this country , from Mackinaw to the Sault , hay is very scarce ; and , during the short summer season , the people go twenty or thirty miles in their canoes to any known patch of prairie or grass land to collect it .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 32]: Nevertheless , they are very often obliged , during the winter , to feed their cattle upon fish , and , strange to say , they acquire a taste for it .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 59]: You will see the horses and cows disputing for the offal ; and our landlord told me that he has often witnessed a particular horse wait very quietly while they were landing the fish from the canoes , watch his opportunity , dart in , steal one , and _ run away with it in his mouth _ .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 30]: A mutiny among our lazzaroni of half-breeds , they refuse to work today , because they are tired , they say , and we are obliged to procure others .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 24]: Carried our canoe over the pasturage into the canal , and in five minutes were on the vast inland sea of Lake Superior .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 41]: The waters of this lake are , if possible , more transparent than those of the Huron , or rather the variety and bright colours of the pebbles and agates which lie at the bottom , make them appear so .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 38]: The appearance of the coast , and the growth of timber , are much the same as on Lake Huron , until you arrive at Gros Cape , a bold promontory , about three hundred feet high .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 43]: We ascended this cape , to have a full view of the expanse of water : this was a severe task , as it was nearly perpendicular , and we were forced to cling from tree to tree to make the ascent .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 73]: In addition to this difficulty , we were unremittingly pursued by the mosquitoes , which blinded us so as to impede our progress , being moreover assisted in their malevolent attacks by a sort of sand-fly , that made triangular incisions behind our ears , exactly like a small leech bite , from which the blood trickled down two or three inches as soon as the little wretch let go his hold .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 24]: This variety of stinging made us almost mad , and we descended quite exhausted , the blood trickling down our faces and necks .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 38]: We threw off our clothes , and plunged into the lake ; the water was too cold ; the agates at the bottom cut our feet severely , and thus were we phlebotomised from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 38]: There is a singular geological feature at this cape ; you do not perceive it until you have forced your way through a belt of firs , which grow at the bottom and screen it from sight .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 71]: It is a ravine in which the rocks are pouring down from the top to the bottom , all so equal in size , and so arranged , as to wear the appearance of a cascade of stones ; and when , half blinded by the mosquitoes , you look upon them , they appear as if they are actually in motion , and falling down in one continued stream .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 27]: We embarked again , and after an hour 's paddling landed upon a small island , where was the tomb of an Indian chief or warrior .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 19]: It was in a beautiful spot , surrounded by the wild rose , blue peas , and campanellas .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 17]: The kinnakinnee , or weed which the Indians smoke as tobacco , grew plentifully about it .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 50]: The mound of earth was surrounded by a low palisade , about four feet wide and seven feet long , and at the head of it was the warrior 's pole , with eagle feathers , and notches denoting the number of scalps he had taken from the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 33]: The Hudson Bay and American Fur Companies both have stations on Lake Superior , on their respective sides of the lake , and the Americans have a small schooner which navigates it .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 45]: There is one question which the traveller can not help asking himself as he surveys the vast mass of water , into which so many rivers pour their contributions , which is -- In what manner is all this accumulation of water carried off ?
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 55]: Except by a very small evaporation in the summer time , and the outlet at Sault St Marie , where the water which escapes is not much more than equal to two or three of the rivers which feed the lake , there is no apparent means by which the water is carried off .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 47]: The only conclusion that can be arrived at is , that when the lake rises above a certain height , as the soil around is sandy and porous , the surplus waters find their way through it ; and such I believe to be the case .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 5]: We saw no bears .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 26]: They do not come down to the shores , -LRB- or travel , as they term it here , -RRB- until the huckleberries are ripe .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 14]: We were told that a month later there would be plenty of them .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 28]: It is an ascertained fact , that the bears from this region migrate to the west every autumn , but it is not known when they return .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 40]: They come down to the eastern shores of the Lakes Superior and Huron , swim the lakes and rivers from island to island , never deviating from their course , till they pass through by Wisconsin to the Missisippi .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 35]: Nothing stops them ; the sight of a canoe will not prevent their taking the water ; and the Indians in the River St Marie have been known to kill fifteen in one day .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 27]: It is singular that the bears on the other side of the Missisippi are said to migrate to the east , exactly in the contrary direction .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 8]: Perhaps the Missisippi is their fashionable watering-place .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 17]: A gathering storm induced us to return , instead of continuing our progress on the lake .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 20]: A birch canoe in a gale of wind on Lake Superior , would not be a very insurable risk .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 30]: On our return , we found our half-breeds very penitent , for had we not taken them back , they would have stood a good chance of wintering there .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 49]: But we had had advice as to the treatment of these lazy gluttonous scoundrels , who swallowed long pieces of raw pork the whole of the day , and towards evening were , from repletion , hanging their heads over the sides of the canoe and quite ill .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 37]: They had been regaled with pork and whisky going up ; we gave them salt fish and a broomstick by way of variety on their return , and they behaved very well under the latter fare .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 36]: We started again down with the stream , and the first night took up our quarters on a prairie spot , where they had been making hay , which was lying in cocks about us .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 27]: To have a soft bed we carried quantities into our tent , forgetting that we disturbed the mosquitoes who had gone to bed in the hay .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 29]: We smoked the tent to drive them out again ; but in smoking the tent we set fire to the hay , and it ended in a conflagration .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 12]: We were burnt out , and had to re-pitch our tent .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 39]: I was sauntering by the side of the river when I heard a rustling in the grass , and perceived a garter snake , an elegant and harmless little creature , about a foot and a half long .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 34]: It had a small toad in its mouth , which it had seized by the head : but it was much too large for the snake to swallow , without leisure and preparation .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 57]: I was amused at the precaution , I may say invention of the toad , to prevent its being swallowed : it had inflated itself , till it was as round as a bladder , and upon this , issue was joined -- the snake would not let go , the toad would not be swallowed .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 19]: I lifted up the snake by the tail and threw them three or four yards into the river .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 42]: The snake rose to the surface , as majestic as the great sea serpent in miniature , carrying his head well out of the water , with the toad still in his mouth , reminding me of Caesar with his Commentaries .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 62]: He landed close to my feet ; I threw him in again , and this time he let go the toad , which remained floating and inanimate an the water ; but after a time he discharged his superfluous gas , and made for the shore ; while the snake , to avoid me , swam away down with the current .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 45]: The next morning it blew hard , and as we opened upon Lake Huron , we had to encounter a heavy sea ; fortunately , the wind was fair for the island of Mackinaw , or we might have been delayed for some days .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 22]: As soon as we were in the Lake we made sail , having fifty-six miles to run before it was dark .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 19]: The gale increased , but the canoe flew over the water , skimming it like a sea bird .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 33]: It was beautiful , but not quite so pleasant , to watch it , as , upon the least carelessness on the part of the helmsman , it would immediately have filled .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 28]: As it was , we shipped some heavy seas , but the blankets at the bottom being saturated , gave us the extra ballast which we required .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 59]: Before we were clear of the islands , we were joined by a whole fleet of Indian canoes , with their dirty blankets spread to the storm , running , as we were , for Mackinaw , being on their return from Maniton Islands , where they had congregated to receive presents from the Governor of Upper Canada .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 28]: Their canoes were , most of them , smaller than ours , which had been built for speed , but they were much higher in the gunnel .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 61]: It was interesting to behold so many hundreds of beings trusting themselves to such fragile conveyances , in a heavy gale and running sea ; but the harder it blew , the faster we went ; and at last , much to my satisfaction , we found ourselves in smooth water again , alongside of the landing wharf at Mackinaw .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 27]: I had had some wish to see a freshwater gale of wind , but in a birch canoe I never wish to try the experiment again .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 2]: Mackinaw .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 33]: -- I mentioned that , in my trip to Lake Superior , I was accompanied by a gentleman attached to the American Fur Company , who have a station at this island .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 31]: I was amusing myself in their establishment , superintending the unpacking and cleaning of about forty or fifty bales of skins , and during the time collected the following information .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 23]: It is an average computation of the furs obtained every year , and the value of each to the American Fur Company .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 42]: The Hudson Bay Company are supposed to average about the same quantity , or rather more ; and they have a larger proportion of valuable furs , such as beaver and sable , but they have few deer and no buffalo .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 39]: When we consider how sterile and unfit for cultivation are these wild northern regions , it certainly appears better that they should remain as they are : -- besides skunks , ground-hogs , hares , and many others .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 22]: These are priced at the lowest : in proportion as the skins are finer , so do they yield higher profit .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 26]: The two companies may be said to receive , between them , skins yearly to the amount of from two to three millions of dollars .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 6]: FABLE APROPOS TO THE SUBJECT .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 28]: A hare and a fox met one day on the vast prairie , and after a long conversation , they prepared to start upon their several routes .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 19]: The hare , pleased with the fox , lamented that they would in all probability separate for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 20]: `` No , no , '' replied the fox , `` we shall meet again , never fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 4]: inquired his companion .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 22]: `` In the _ hatter 's shop _ , to be sure , '' rejoined the fox , tripping lightly away .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 4]: _ Detroit _ .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 23]: -- There are some pleasant people in this town , and the society is quite equal to that of the eastern cities .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 33]: From the constant change and transition which take place in this country , go where you will you are sure to fall in with a certain portion of intelligent , educated people .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 32]: This is not the case in the remoter portions of the Old Continent , where every thing is settled , and generation succeeds generation , as in some obscure country town .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 56]: But in America , where all is new , and the country has to be peopled from the other parts , there is a proportion of intelligence and education transplanted with the inferior classes , either from the Eastern States or from the Old World , in whatever quarter you may happen to find yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 13]: Left my friends at Detroit with regret , and returned to Buffalo .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 49]: There is a marked difference between the behaviour of the lower people of the eastern cities and those whom you fall in with in this town : they are much less civil in their behaviour here ; indeed , they appear to think rudeness a proof of independence .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 25]: I went to the theatre , and the behaviour of the majority of the company just reminded me of the Portsmouth and Plymouth theatres .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 11]: I had forgotten that Buffalo was a fresh-water sea-port town .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 21]: Returning to Niagara , I took possession of the roof of the rail-coach , that I might enjoy the prospect .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 56]: I had not travelled three miles before I perceived a strong smell of burning ; at last the pocket of my coat , which was of cotton , burst out into flames , a spark having found its way into it : fortunately -LRB- not being insured -RRB- there was no property on the premises .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 39]: When the celebrated Colonel David Crocket first saw a locomotive , with the train smoking along the rail-road , he exclaimed , as it flew past him , `` Hell in harness , by the ` tarnel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 13]: I may , in juxtaposition with this , mention an Indian idea .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 58]: Nothing surprised the Indians so much at first , as the percussion for guns : they thought them the _ ne plus ultra _ of invention : when , therefore , an Indian was first shewn a locomotive , he reflected a little while , and then said , `` I see -- _ percussion _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 33]: There is a beautiful island , dividing the Falls of Niagara , called Goat Island : they have thrown a bridge across the rapids , so that you can now go over .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 25]: A mill has already been erected there , which is a great pity ; it is a contemptible disfigurement of nature 's grandest work .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 39]: At the head of the island , which is surrounded by the rapids , exactly where the waters divide to run on each side of it , there is a small triangular portion of still or slack water .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 10]: I perceived this , and went in to bathe .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 66]: The line of the current on each side of it is plainly marked , and runs at the speed of nine or ten miles an hour ; if you put your hand or foot a little way outside this line , they are immediately borne away by its force ; if you went into it yourself , nothing could prevent your going down the falls .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 18]: As I returned , I observed an ugly snake in my path , and I killed it .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 21]: An American , who came up , exclaimed , `` I reckon that 's a _ copper-head _ , stranger !
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 11]: I never knew that they were in this island . ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 22]: I found out that I had killed a snake quite as venomous , if not more so , than a rattlesnake .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 24]: One never tires with these falls ; indeed , it takes a week at least to find out all their varieties and beauties .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 17]: There are some sweet spots on Goat Island , where you can meditate and be alone .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 24]: I witnessed , during my short stay here , that indifference to the destruction of life , so very remarkable in this country .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 53]: The rail-car crushed the head of a child of about seven years old , as it was going into the engine-house ; the other children ran to the father , a blacksmith , who was at work at his forge close by , crying out , `` Father , Billy killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 39]: The man put down his hammer , walked leisurely to where the boy lay , in a pool of his own blood , took up the body , and returned with it under his arm to his house .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 14]: In a short time , the hammer rang upon the anvil as before .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 21]: The game of nine-pins is a favourite game in America , and very superior to what it is in England .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 29]: In America , the ground is always covered properly over , and the balls are rolled upon a wooden floor , as correctly levelled as a billiard table .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 21]: The ladies join in the game , which here becomes an agreeable and not too fatiguing -LSB- an -RSB- exercise .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 60]: I was very fond of frequenting their alleys , not only for the exercise , but because , among the various ways of estimating character , I had made up my mind that there was none more likely to be correct , than the estimate formed by the manner in which people roll the balls , especially the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 17]: There were some very delightful specimens of American females when I was this time at Niagara .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 35]: We sauntered about the falls and wood in the day time , or else played at nine-pins ; in the evening we looked at the moon , spouted verses , and drank mint juleps .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 45]: But all that was too pleasant to last long : I felt that I had not come to America to play at nine-pins ; so I tore myself away , and within the next twenty-four hours found myself at Toronto , in Upper Canada .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 41]: Toronto , which is the present capital and seat of government of Upper Canada , is , from its want of spires and steeples , by no means an imposing town , as you view it on entering the harbour .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 14]: The harbour itself is landlocked , and when deepened will be very good .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 22]: A great deal of money has been expended by the English government upon the Canadian provinces , but not very wisely .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 57]: The Rideau and Willend canals are splendid works ; they have nothing to compare with them in the United States ; but they are too much in advance of the country , and will be of but little use for a long period , if the provinces do not go a-head faster than they do now .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 28]: One half the money spent in making good roads through the provinces would have done more good , and would have much increased the value of property .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 37]: The proposed rail-road from Hamilton to Detroit would be of greater importance ; and if more money is to be expended on Upper Canada , it can not be better disposed of than in this undertaking .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 42]: The minute you put your foot on shore , you feel that you are no longer in the United States ; you are at once struck with the difference between the English and the American population , systems , and ideas .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 22]: On the other side of the Lake you have much more apparent property , but much less real solidity and security .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 19]: The houses and stores at Toronto are not to be compared with those of the American towns opposite .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 18]: But the Englishman has built according to his means -- the American , according to his expectations .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 30]: The hotels and inns at Toronto are very bad ; at Buffalo they are splendid : for the Englishman travels little ; the American is ever on the move .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 68]: The private houses of Toronto are built , according to the English taste and desire of exclusiveness , away from the road , and are embowered in trees ; the American , let his house be ever so large , or his plot of ground however extensive , builds within a few feet of the road , that he may see and know what is going on .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 52]: You do not perceive the bustle , the energy , and activity at Toronto , that you do at Buffalo , nor the profusion of articles in the stores ; but it should be remembered that the Americans procure their articles upon credit , whilst at Toronto they proceed more cautiously .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 24]: The Englishman builds his house and furnishes his store according to his means and fair expectations of being able to meet his acceptances .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 23]: If an American has money sufficient to build a two-story house , he will raise it up to four stories on speculation .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 29]: We must not , on one side , be dazzled with the effects of the credit system in America , nor yet be too hasty in condemning it .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 45]: It certainly is the occasion of much over-speculation ; but if the parties who speculate are ruined , provided the money has been laid out , as it usually is in America , upon real property -- such as wharfs , houses , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 23]: -- a new country becomes a gainer , as the improvements are made and remain , although they fall into other hands .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 44]: And it should be further pointed out , that the Americans are justified in their speculations from the fact , that property improved rises so fast in value , that they are soon able to meet all claims and realise a handsome profit .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 47]: They speculate on the future ; but the future with them is not distant as it is with us , ten years in America being , as I have before observed , equal to a century in Europe : they are therefore warranted in so speculating .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 43]: The property in Buffalo is now worth one hundred times what it was when the first speculators commenced ; for as the country and cities become peopled , and the communication becomes easy , so does the value of every thing increase .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 11]: Why , then , does not Toronto vie with Buffalo ?
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 24]: Because the Canadas can not obtain the credit which is given to the United States , and of which Buffalo has her portion .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 29]: America has returns to make to England in her cotton crops : Canada has nothing ; for her timber would be nothing , if it were not protected .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 12]: She can not , therefore , obtain credit as America does .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 15]: What , then , do the Canadas require , in order to become prosperous ?
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 2]: Capital !
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 89]: I must not , however , omit to inform my readers that at Toronto I received a letter from a `` Brother Author , '' who was polite enough to send me several specimens of his poetry ; stating the remarkable fact , that he had never written a verse until he was past forty-five years of age ; and that , as to the unfair accusation of his having plagiarised from Byron , it was not true , for he never had read Byron in his life .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 44]: Having put the reader in possession of these facts , I shall now select one of his printed poems for his gratification : -- From the Regard the Author has for the LADIES OF TORONTO , He presents them with the following ODE .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 11]: _ To the Ladies of the City of Toronto _ .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 27]: How famed is our city For the beauty and talents Of our ladies , that 's pretty And _ chaste _ in their _ sentiments _ .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 23]: The ladies of Toronto Are fine , noble , and charming , And are a great memento To all , most fascinating .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 27]: Our ladies are the best kind , Of all others the most fine ; In their manners and their minds Most refined and _ genuine _ .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 2]: 4 .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 20]: We are proud of our ladies , For they are superior To all other beauties And others are inferior .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 2]: 5 .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 18]: How favoured is our land To be honoured with the fair , That is so majestic grand !
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 8]: And to please them is our care .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 2]: 6 .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 21]: Who would not choose them before All others that 's to be found , And think of others no more ?
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 9]: Their like is not in the world round .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 7]: TS TORONTO , 21st Jan. 1837 .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 20]: Through Lake Ontario to Montreal , by rail road to Lake Champlain , and then by steamboat to Burlington .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 53]: Burlington is a pretty county town on the border of the Lake Champlain ; there is a large establishment for the education of boys kept here by the Bishop of Vermont , a clever man : it is said to be well conducted , and one of the best in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 36]: The bishop 's salary , as bishop , is only five hundred dollars ; as a preacher of the established church he receives seven hundred ; whilst as a schoolmaster his revenue becomes very handsome .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 28]: The bishop is just now in bad odour with the _ majority _ , for having published some very sensible objections to the Revivals and Temperance Societies .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 2]: Plattsburg .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 10]: -- This was the scene of an American triumph .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 26]: I was talking with a States officer , who was present during the whole affair , and was much amused with his description of it .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 39]: There appeared to be some fatality attending almost all our attacks upon America during the last war ; and it should be remarked , that whenever the Americans entered upon our territory , they met with similar defeat .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 51]: Much allowance must at course be made for ignorance of the country , and of the strength and disposition of the enemy 's force ; but certainly there was no excuse for the indecision shewn by the British general , with such a force as he had under his command .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 18]: Now that the real facts are known , one hardly knows whether to laugh or feel indignant .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 13]: The person from whom I had the information is of undoubted respectability .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 36]: At the time that our general advanced with an army of 7,000 Peninsular troops , there were but 1,000 militia at Plattsburg , those ordered out from the interior of the State not having arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 73]: It is true that there were 2,000 of the Vermont militia at Burlington opposite to Plattsburg , but when they were sent for , they refused to go there ; they were alarmed at the preponderating force of the British , and they stood upon their State rights -- i.e. , militia raised in a State are not bound to leave it , being raised for the defence of that State alone .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 30]: The small force at Plattsburg hardly knew whether to retreat or not ; they expected large reinforcements under General McCoomb , but did not know when they would come .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 54]: At last it was proposed and agreed to that they should spread themselves and keep up an incessant firing , but out of distance , so as to make the British believe they had a much larger force than they really possessed ; and on this judicious plan they acted , and succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 38]: In the mean time , the British general was anxious for the assistance of the squadron on the lakes , under Commodore Downie , and pressed him to the attack of the American squadron then off Plattsburg .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 14]: Some sharp remarks from the General proved fatal to our cause by water .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 16]: Downie , stung by his insinuations , rushed inconsiderately into a _ close _ engagement .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 11]: Now , Commodore Downie 's vessels had all long guns .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 7]: McDonough 's vessels had only carronades .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 89]: Had , therefore , Downie not thrown away this advantage , by engaging at close quarters , there is fair reason to suppose that the victory would have been ours , as he could have chosen his distance , and the fire of the American vessels would have been comparatively harmless ; but he ran down close to McDonough 's fleet , and engaged them broadside to broadside , and then the carronades of the Americans , being of heavy calibre , threw the advantage on their side .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 19]: Downie was killed by the wind of a shot a few minutes after the commencement of the action .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 21]: Still it was the hardest contested action of the war ; Pring being well worthy to take Downie 's place .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 75]: It was impossible to have done more on either side ; and the gentleman who gave me this information added , that McDonough told him that so nicely balanced were the chances , that he took out his watch just before the British colours were hauled down , and observed , `` If they hold out ten minutes more , it will be more than , I am afraid , we can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 30]: As soon as the victory was decided on the part of the Americans , the British general commenced his retreat , and was followed by this handful of militia .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 23]: In a day or two afterwards , General McCoomb came up , and a large force was poured in from all quarters .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 17]: There was something very similar and quite as ridiculous in the affair at Sackett 's harbour .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 51]: Our forces advancing would have cut off some hundreds of the American militia , who were _ really _ retreating , but by a road which led in such a direction as for a time to make the English commandant suppose that they were intending to take him in flank .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 28]: This made him imagine that they must be advancing in large numbers , when , the fact was , they were running away from his superior force .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 21]: He made a retreat ; upon ascertaining which , the Americans turned back and followed him , harassing his rear .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 34]: I was told , at Baltimore , that had the English advanced , the American militia was quite ready to run away , not having the idea of opposing themselves to trained soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 47]: It really was very absurd ; but in many instances during the war , which have come to my knowledge , it was exactly this , -- `` If you do n't run , I will ; but if you will , I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 39]: The name given by the French to Vermont , designates the features of the country , which is composed of small mountains , covered with verdure to their summits ; but the land is by no means good .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 54]: At the bottoms , on the banks of the rivers , the alluvial soil is rich , and , generally speaking , the land in this State admits of cultivation about half-way up the mountains ; after which , it is fit for nothing but sheep-walks , or to grow small timber upon .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 97]: I have travelled much in the Eastern States , and have been surprised to find how very small a portion of all of them is under cultivation , considering how long they have been settled ; nor will there be more of the land taken up , I presume , for a long period ; that is to say , not until the West is so over-peopled that a reflux is compelled to fall back into the Eastern States , and the crowded masses , like the Gulf-stream , find vent to the northward and eastward .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 9]: Set off by coach , long before day-light .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 40]: There is something very gratifying when once you _ are up _ , in finding yourself up before the sun ; you can repeat to yourself , `` How doth the little busy bee , '' with such satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 33]: Some few stars still twinkled in the sky , winking like the eyelids of tired sentinels , but soon they were relieved , one after another , by the light of morning .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 36]: It was still dark when we started , and off we went , up hill and down hill -- short steep _ pitches _ , as they term them here -- at a furious rate .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 18]: There was no level ground ; it was all undulating , and very trying to the springs .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 51]: But an American driver stops at nothing ; he will flog away with six horses in hand ; and it is wonderful how few accidents happen : but it is very fatiguing , and one hundred miles of American travelling by stage , is equal to four hundred in England .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 37]: There is much amusement to be extracted from the drivers of these stages , if you will take your seat with them on the front , which few Americans do , as they prefer the inside .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 27]: One of the drivers , soon after we had changed our team , called out to the off-leader , as he flanked her with his whip .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 11]: `` Go along , you _ no-tongued _ crittur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 7]: `` Why _ no-tongued _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 34]: enquired I. `` Well , I reckon she has no tongue , having bitten it off herself , I was going to say -- but it was n't exactly that , neither . ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 8]: `` How was it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 35]: `` Well now , the fact is , that she is awful ugly , '' -LRB- ill-tempered -RRB- ; `` she bites like a badger , and kicks up as high as the church-steeple .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 8]: She 's an almighty crittur to handle .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 59]: I was trying to hitch her under-jaw like , with the halter , but she worretted so , that I could only hitch her tongue : she ran back , the end of the halter was fast to the ring , and so she left her tongue in the hitch -- that 's a _ fact _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 16]: `` I wonder it did not kill her ; did n't she bleed very much ?
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 10]: How does she contrive to eat her corn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 16]: `` Well , now , she bled pretty considerable -- but not to speak off .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 48]: I did keep her _ one day _ in the stable , because I thought she might feel _ queer _ ; since that she has worked in the team every day ; and she 'll eat her peck of corn with any horse in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 21]: But her tongue is out , that 's certain -- so _ she 'll tell no more lies _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 43]: Not the least doubting my friend 's veracity I , nevertheless , took an opportunity , when we changed , of ascertaining the fact ; and her tongue was _ half _ of it out , that _ is _ the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 14]: When we stopped , we had to shift the luggage to another coach .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 95]: The driver , who was a slight man , was , for some time , looking rather puzzled at the trunks which lay on the road , and which he had to put on the coach : he tried to lift one of the largest , let it down again , and then beckoned to me : -- `` I say , captain , them four large trunks be rather overmuch for me ; but I guess you can master them , so just lift them up on the hind board for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 22]: I complied ; and as I had to lift them as high as my head , they required all my strength .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 27]: `` Thank ye , captain ; do n't trouble yourself any more , the rest be all right , and I can manage them myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 14]: The Americans never refuse to assist each other in such difficulties as this .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 27]: In a young country they must assist each other , if they wish to be assisted themselves -- and there always will be a mutual dependence .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 26]: If a man is in a _ fix _ in America , every one stops to assist him , and expects the same for himself .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 23]: Bellows Falls , a beautiful , romantic spot on the Connecticut River , which separates the States of New Hampshire and Vermont .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 36]: The masses of rocks through which the river forces its way at the Falls , are very grand and imposing ; and the surrounding hills , rich with the autumnal tints , rivet the eye .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 27]: On these masses of rocks are many faces , cut out by the tribe of Pequod Indians , who formerly used to fish in their waters .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 17]: Being informed that there was to be a militia muster , I resolved to attend it .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 14]: The militia service is not in good odour with the Americans just now .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 32]: Formerly , when they did try to do as well as they could , the scene was absurd enough ; but now they do all they can to make it ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 67]: In this muster there were three or four companies , well equipped ; but the major part of the men were what they call here _ flood-wood _ , that is , of all sizes and heights -- a term suggested by the pieces of wood borne down by the freshets of the river , and which are of all sorts , sizes , and lengths .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 45]: But not only were the men of all sorts and sizes , but the uniforms also , some of which were the most extraordinary I ever beheld , and not unlike the calico dresses worn by the tumblers and vaulters at an English fair .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 72]: As for the exercise , they either did not , or would not , know any thing about it ; indeed , as they are now mustered but once a year , it can not be expected that they should ; but as they faced every way , and made mistakes on purpose , it is evident , from their consistent pertinacity in being wrong , that they did know something .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 41]: When they marched off single file , quick time , they were one half of them dancing in and out of the ranks to the lively tune which was played -- the only instance I saw of their keeping time .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 38]: But the most amusing part of the ceremony was the speech made by the brigade major , whose patience had certainly been tried , and who wished to impress his countrymen with the importance of the militia .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 9]: He ordered them to form a hollow square .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 32]: They formed a circle , proving that if they could not square the circle , at all events they could circle the square , which is coming very near to it .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 27]: The major found himself , on his white horse , in an arena about as large as that in which Mr Ducrow performs at Astley 's .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 25]: He then commenced a sort of perambulating equestrian speech , riding round and round the circle , with his cocked hat in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 62]: As the arena was large , and he constantly turned his head as he spoke to those nearest to him in the circle , it was only when he came to within a few yards of you , that you could distinguish what he was saying ; and of course the auditors at the other point were in the same predicament .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 159]: However , he divided his speech out in portions very equally , and those which came to my share were as follows : `` Yes , gentlemen -- the president , senate , and house of representatives , and all others ... you militia , the bones and muscle of the land , and by whom ... Eagle of America shall ruffle her wings , will ever dart ... those days so glorious , when our gallant forefathers ... terrible effect of the use of ardent spirits , and shewing ... Temperance societies , the full benefits of which , I am ... Star-spangled banner , ever victorious , blazing like ... '' The last word I heard was _ glory _ ; but his audience being very impatient for their dinner , cried out loudly for it -- preferring it to the mouthfuls of eloquence which fell to their share , but did not stay their stomach .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 11]: Altogether it was a scene of much fun and good-humour .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 19]: Stopped at the pretty village of Charlestown , celebrated for the defence it made during the French war .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 50]: There is here , running by the river side , a turnpike road , which gave great offence to the American citizens of this State : they declared that to pay toll was _ monarchical _ , as they always assert every thing to be which taxes their pockets .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 57]: So , one fine night , they assembled with a hawser and a team or two of horses , made the hawser fast to the house at the gate , dragged it down to the river , and sent it floating down the stream , with the gate and board of tolls in company with it .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 38]: Progressing in the stage , I had a very amusing specimen of the ruling passion of the country -- the spirit of barter , which is communicated to the females , as well as to the boys .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 74]: I will stop for a moment , however , to say , that I heard of an American , who had two sons , and he declared that they were so clever at barter , that he locked them both up together in a room , without a cent in their pockets , and that before they had _ swopped _ for an hour , they had each gained two dollars a piece .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 25]: But now for my fellow-passengers -- both young , both good-looking , and both ladies , and evidently were total strangers to each other .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 21]: One had a pretty pink silk bonnet , very fine for travelling ; the other , an indifferent plush one .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 41]: The young lady in the plush , eyed the pink bonnet for some time : at last _ Plush _ observed in a drawling half-indifferent way : `` That 's rather a pretty bonnet of your 's , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 15]: `` Why yes , I calculate it 's rather smart , '' replied Pink .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 7]: After a pause and closer survey .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 16]: -- `` You would n't have any objection to part with it , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 24]: `` Well now , I do n't know but I might ; I have worn it but three days , I reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 5]: `` Oh , my !
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 19]: I should have reckoned that you carried it longer -- perhaps it rained on them three days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 13]: `` I 've a notion it did n't rain , not one .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 13]: -- It 's not the only bonnet I have , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 20]: `` Well now , I should not mind an exchange , and paying you the _ balance _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 14]: `` That 's an awful thing that you have on , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 13]: `` I rather think not , but that 's as may be .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 11]: -- Come , miss , what will you take ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 14]: `` Why I do n't know , -- what will you give ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 14]: `` I reckon you 'll know best when you answer my question . ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 14]: `` Well then , I should n't like less than five dollars . ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 7]: `` Five dollars and my bonnet !
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 17]: I reckon two would be nearer the mark -- but it 's of no consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 17]: `` None in the least , miss , only I know the value of my bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 10]: -- We 'll say no more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 7]: `` Just so , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 42]: A pause and silence for half a minute , when Miss Plush , looks out of the window , and says , as if talking to herself , `` I should n't mind giving four dollars , but no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 50]: She then fell back in her seat , when Miss Pink , put her head out of the window , and said : -- `` I should n't refuse four dollars after all , if it was offered , '' and then she fell back to her former position .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 12]: `` Did you think of taking four dollars , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 14]: I do n't care , I 've plenty of bonnets at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 18]: `` Well , '' replied Plush , taking out her purse , and offering her the money .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 9]: `` What bank is this , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 15]: `` Oh , all 's right there , Safety Fund , I calculate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 12]: The two ladies exchange bonnets , and Pink pockets the balance .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 23]: I may here just as well mention the custom of _ whittling _ , which is so common in the Eastern States .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 35]: It is a habit , arising from the natural restlessness of the American when he is not employed , of cutting a piece of stick , or any thing else , with his knife .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 38]: Some are so wedded to it from long custom , that if they have not a piece of stick to cut , they will whittle the backs of the chairs , or any thing within their reach .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 26]: A yankee shewn into a room to await the arrival of another , has been known to whittle away nearly the whole of the mantle-piece .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 20]: Lawyers in court whittle away at the table before them ; and judges will cut through their own bench .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 15]: In some courts , they put sticks before noted whittlers to save the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 65]: The Down-Easters , as the yankees are termed generally , whittle when they are making a bargain , as it fills up the pauses , gives them time for reflection , and moreover , prevents any examination of the countenance -- for in bargaining , like in the game of brag , the countenance is carefully watched , as an index to the wishes .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 29]: I was once witness to a bargain made between two respectable yankees , who wished to agree about a farm , and in which whittling was resorted to .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 63]: They sat down on a log of wood , about , three or four feet apart from each other , with their faces turned opposite ways -- that is , one had his legs on one side of the log with his face to the East , and the other his legs on the other side with his face to the West .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 31]: One had a piece of soft wood , and was sawing it with his penknife ; the other had an unbarked hiccory stick which he was peeling for a walking-stick .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 20]: The reader will perceive a strong analogy between this bargain and that in the stage between the two ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 12]: `` Well , good morning -- and about this farm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 12]: `` I do n't know ; what will you take ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 7]: `` What will you give ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 6]: Silence , and whittle away .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 19]: `` Well , I should think two thousand dollars , a heap of money for this farm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 17]: `` I 've a notion it will never go for three thousand , any how . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 16]: `` There 's a fine farm , and cheaper , on the North side . ''
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 12]: `` But where 's the sun to ripen the corn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 8]: `` Sun shines on all alike . ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 11]: `` Not exactly through a Vermont hill , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 16]: The driver offered me as much as I say , if I recollect right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 9]: `` Money not always to be depended upon .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 6]: Money not always forthcoming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 19]: `` I reckon , I shall make an elegant ` backy stopper of this piece of sycamore . ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 6]: Silence for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 5]: Knives hard at work .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 21]: `` I 've a notion this is as pretty a hiccory stick as ever came out of a wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 16]: `` I should n't mind two thousand five hundred dollars , and time given . ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 19]: `` It could n't be more than six months then , if it goes at that price . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 4]: -LRB- Pause . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 9]: `` Well , that might suit me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 9]: `` What do you say , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 8]: `` Suppose it must be so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 20]: `` It 's a bargain then , '' rising up ; `` come let 's liquor on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 6]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 17]: The farmers on the banks of the Connecticut river are the richest in the Eastern States .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 22]: The majestic growth of the timber certified that the soil is generally good , although the crops were off the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 53]: They grow here a large quantity of what is called the broom corn : the stalk and leaves are similar to the maize or Indian corn , but , instead of the ear , it throws out , at top and on the sides , spiky plumes on which seed is carried .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 26]: These plumes are cut off , and furnish the brooms and whisks of the country ; it is said to be a very profitable crop .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 37]: At Brattleboro ' we stopped at an inn kept by one of the State representatives , and , as may be supposed , had very bad fare in consequence , the man being above his business .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 21]: We changed horses at Bloody Brook , so termed in consequence of a massacre of the settlers by the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 15]: But there are twenty Bloody Brooks in America , all records of similar catastrophes .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 29]: Whether the Blue laws of Connecticut are supposed to be still in force I know not , but I could not discover that they had ever been repealed .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 17]: At present there is no theatre in Connecticut , nor does anybody venture to propose one .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 43]: The proprietors of one of the equestrian studs made their appearance at the confines of the State , and intimated that they wished to perform , but were given to understand that their horses would be confiscated if they entered the State .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 81]: The consequence is that Connecticut is the dullest , most disagreeable State in the Union ; and , if I am to believe the Americans themselves , so far from the morals of the community being kept uncontaminated by this rigour , the very reverse is the case -- especially as respects the college students , who are in the secret practice of more vice than is to be found in any other establishment of the kind in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 27]: But even if I had not been so informed by creditable people , I should have decided in my own mind that such was the case .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 7]: Human nature is everywhere the same .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 50]: It may be interesting to make a few extracts from a copy of the records and of the Blue laws which I have in my possession , as it will show that if these laws were still in force how hard they would now bear upon the American community .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 37]: In the extracts from the records which follow I have altered a word or two , so as to render them fitter for perusal , but the sense remains the same : '' -LRB- 13 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 80]: If any childe or children above sixteene yeares old , and of suffitient understanding , shall curse or smite their naturall father or mother , hee or they shall bee _ put to death _ ; unless it can be sufficiently testified that the parents have been very unchristianly negligent in the education of such children , or so provoke them by extreme and cruell correction that they have been forced thereunto to preserve themselves from death , maiming .

Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 21]: Among the records we have some curious specimens : -- `` At a Court , held May 1 , 1660 .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 110]: `` Jacob M Murline and Sarah Tuttle being called , appeared , concerning whom the governor declared , that the business for which they were warned to this Court , he had heard in private at his house , which he related thus : -- On the day that John Potter was married , Sarah Tuttle went to Mistress Murline 's house for some thredd ; Mistress Murline bid her go to her daughters in the other roome , where she felle into speeche of John Potter and his wife , that they were both lame ; upon which Sarah Tuttle said , how very awkward it would be .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 15]: Whereupon Jacob came in , and tooke up , or tooke away her gloves .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 99]: Sarah desired him to give her the gloves , to which he answered , he would do so if she would give him a kysse ; upon which they sat down together , his arme being about her waiste , and her arme upon his shoulder , or about his neck , and _ he _ kissed her , and _ she _ kissed him , or they kissed one another , continuing in this posture about half an hour , as Marian and Susan testified , which Marian , now in Court , affirmed to be so .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 33]: `` Mistress Murline , now in Court , said that she heard Sarah say , how very awkward it would be ; but it was matter of sorrow and shame unto her .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 71]: `` Jacob was asked what he had to say to these things ; to which he answered , that he was in the other roome , and when he heard Sarah speak those words , he went in , when shee having let fall her gloves , he tooke them up , and she asked him for them ; he told her he would , if she would kisse him .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 81]: Further said , hee took her by the hand , and they both sat down upon a chest , but whether his arme were about her waiste , and her arme upon his shoulder , or about his neck , he knows not , for he never thought of it since , till Mr Raymond told him of it at Mannatos , for which he was blamed , and told he had not layde it to heart as he ought .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 12]: But Sarah Tuttle replied , that shee did not kysse him .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 22]: Mr Tuttle replied , that Marian hath denied it , and he doth not looke upon her as a competent witness .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 19]: Thomas Tuttle said , that he asked Marian if his sister kyssed Jacob , and she said not .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 21]: Moses Mansfield testified , that he told Jacob Murline that he heard Sarah kyssed him , but he denied it .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 8]: But Jacob graunted not what Moses testified .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 16]: `` Mr Tuttle pleaded that Jacob had endeavoured to steal away his daughter 's affections .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 15]: But Sarah being asked , if Jacob had inveigled her , she said no .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 64]: Thomas Tuttle said , that he came to their house two or three times before he went to Holland , and they two were together , and to what end he came he knows not , unless it were to inveigle her : and their mother warned Sarah not to keep company with him : and to the same purpose spake Jonathan Tuttle .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 23]: But Jacob denied that he came to their house with any such intendment , nor did it appear so to the Court .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 67]: `` The governor told Sarah that her miscarriage is the greatest , that a virgin should be so bold in the presence of others , to carry it as she had done , and to speake suche corrupt words ; most of the things charged against her being acknowledged by herself , though that about kyssing is denied , yet the _ thing _ is proved .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 39]: `` Sarah professed that she was sorry that she had carried it so sinfully and foolishly , which she saw to be hateful : she hoped God would help her to carry it better for time to come .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 88]: `` The governor also told Jacob that his carriage hath been very evil and sinful , so to carry it towards her , and to make such a light matter of it as not to think of it , -LRB- as he exprest -RRB- doth greatly aggravate ; and for Marian , who was a married woman , to suffer her brother and a man 's daughter to sit almost half an hour in such a way as they have related , was a very great evil .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 29]: She was told that she should have showed her indignation against it , and have told her mother , that Sarah might have been shut out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 18]: Mrs Murline was told , that she , hearing such words , should not have suffered it .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 20]: Mrs Tuttle and Mrs Murline being asked if they had any more to say , they said , no .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 41]: `` Whereupon the Court declared , that we have heard in the publique ministry , that it is a thing to be lamented , that young people should have their meetings , to the corrupting of themselves and one another .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 53]: As for Sarah Tuttle , her miscarriages are very great , that she should utter so corrupt a speeche as she did , concerning the persons to be married ; and that she should carry it in such a wanton , uncivil , immodest , and lacivious manner as hath been proved .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 23]: And for Jacob , his carriage hath been very corrupt and sinful , such as brings reproach upon the family and place .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 28]: `` The sentence , therefore , concerning them is , that they shall pay either of them as a fine , twenty shillings to the treasurer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 22]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ `` Isaiah , Captain Turner 's man , fined 5 pounds for being drunk on the Lord 's - day .

Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 11]: Here comes a very disorderly reprobate , called Will Harding .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 8]: `` 1st of 1st month , 1643 .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 62]: `` John Lawrence and Valentine , servants to Mr Malbon , for imbezilling their master 's goods , and keeping disorderly night meetings with Will Harding , a lewd and disorderly person , plotting with him to carry their master 's daughters to the farmes in the night , concealing divers dalliances ; all which they confessed , and were whipped .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 33]: `` Ruth Acie , a covenant-servant to Mr Malbon , for stubornes , lyeing , stealing from her mistress , and yielding to dalliance with Will Harding , was _ whipped _ .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 43]: `` Martha Malbon , for consenting to goe in the night to the farmes , with Will Harding , to a venison feast ; for stealing things from her parents , and dalliance with the said Harding , was _ whipped _ .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 79]: `` Goodman Hunt and his wife , for keeping the councells of the said Will Harding , _ bakeing him a pastry and plum cakes _ , and keeping company with him on the Lord 's - day ; and she suffering Harding to kisse her , they being only admitted to sojourn in this plantation upon their good behaviour , was ordered to be sent out of this towne within one month after the date hereof .

Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 13]: Will Harding , however , appears to have met with his deserts .

Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 82]: `` Will Harding , being convicted of a great deal of base carriage with divers yonge girls , together with enticing and corrupting divers men-servants in this plantation , haunting with them at night meetings and junketings , etcetera , was sentenced to be _ severely _ whipped , and fined 5 pounds to Mr Malbon , and 5 pounds to Will Andrews , whose famylyes and daughters he hath so much wronged ; and presently to depart the plantation .

Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 16]: Thus winds up the _ disgraceful _ end of our Colonial Don Juan of 1643 .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 52]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The articles of the Blue laws , which I have extracted , are from a portion which appears to have been drawn up more in detail ; but , generally , they are much more pithy and concise , as the following examples will show : -- `` No. 13 .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 16]: No food and lodgings shall be allowed a Quaker , Adamite , or other heretic .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 4]: `` No. 14 .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 23]: If any person turns Quaker , he shall be banished , and not suffered to return , on pain of death . ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 16]: I was walking in Philadelphia , when I perceived the name of Buffum , Hatter .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 35]: Wishing to ascertain whether it was an English name or not , I went in , and entered into conversation with Mr Buffum , who was dressed as what is termed a wet Quaker .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 39]: He told me that his was an English name , and that his ancestor had been banished from Salem for a heinous crime -- which was , as the sentence worded it , for being a damned Quaker .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 25]: The reason why Quakers were banished by the Puritans , was because they would not ; go out to _ shoot the Indians _ !
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 8]: To continue : -- `` No. 17 .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 25]: No one shall _ run _ of a Sabbath-day , or walk in his garden or elsewhere , except reverently to and from church .

Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 17]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I do not know any thing that disgusts me so much as _ cant _ .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 23]: Even now we continually hear , in the American public orations , about the _ stern virtues _ of the pilgrim fathers .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 6]: _ Stern _ , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 28]: The fact is , that these pilgrim fathers were fanatics and bigots , without charity or mercy , wanting in the very _ essence _ of Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 13]: Witness their conduct to the Indians when they thirsted for their territory .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 28]: After the death -LRB- murder , we may well call it -RRB- of Alexander , the brother of the celebrated Philip , the latter prepared for war .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 75]: `` And now , '' says a reverend historian of the times , `` war was begun by a fierce nation of Indians upon an _ honest , harmless _ Christian generation of English , who might very truly have said to the aggressors , as it was said of old unto the Ammonites , ` I have not sinned against thee ; but thou doest me wrong to war against me . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 15]: Fanaticism alone -- deep , incurable fanaticism -- could have induced such a remark .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 20]: Well may it be said , `` We deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 80]: And when the war was brought to a close by the death of the noble-minded , high-spirited Philip ; when the _ Christians _ had slaked their revenge in his blood , exposed his head in triumph on a pike , and captured his helpless innocent child of nine years old ; would it be credited , that there was council held to put this child to death , and that the clergy were summoned to give their opinion ?
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 16]: And the clergy _ quoted Scripture _ , that the _ child must die _ !
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 24]: Dr Increase Mather compared it with the child of Hadid , and recommended , with his brother apostles , that it be murdered .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 26]: But these pious men were overruled ; and , with many others , it was sent to the Bermudas , and sold as a slave .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 11]: _ Stern virtues _ !! Call them rather diabolical vices .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 4]: God of Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 12]: when shall we learn to call things by their right names ?
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 30]: The next time Governor Everett is called up for an oration at Bloody Brook , let him not talk quite so much of the virtues of the pilgrim fathers .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 20]: This reminds me of a _ duty _ towards this gentleman , which I have great pleasure in performing .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 23]: Every one who is acquainted with him must acknowledge his amiable manners , and his high classical attainments and power of eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 17]: His orations and speeches are printed , and are among the best specimens of American talent .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 83]: Miss Martineau , in her work upon America , states that she went up to hear the orator at Bloody Brook ; and , in two pages of very coarse , unmeasured language , states `` that all her _ sympathies _ were baffled , and that she was deeply disgusted ; '' that the orator `` offered them shreds of tawdry sentiment , without the intermixture of one sound thought or simple and natural feeling , simply and naturally expressed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 10]: I have the Address of Governor Everett before me .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 34]: To insert the whole of it would be inconvenient ; but I do most unequivocally deny this , as I must , I am afraid , to many of Miss Martineau 's assertions .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 72]: To prove , in this one instance alone , the very contrary to what she states , I will merely quote the peroration of Governor Everett 's Address : -- `` Yon simple monument shall rise a renewed memorial of their names on this sacred spot , where the young , the brave , the patriotic , poured out their life-blood in defence of that heritage which has descended to us .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 10]: We this day solemnly bring our tribute of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 89]: Ages shall pass away ; the majestic tree which overshadows us shall wither and sink before the blast , and we who are now gathered beneath it shall mingle with the honoured dust we eulogise ; but the ` Flowers of Essex ' shall bloom in undying remembrance ; and , with every century , these rites of commemoration shall be repeated , as the lapse of time shall continually develope , in rich abundance , the fruits of what was done and suffered by our forefathers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 47]: I can , however , give the reader a key to Miss Martineau 's praise or condemnation of every person mentioned in her two works : you have but to ask the question , `` Is he , or is he not , an abolitionist ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 7]: Governor Everett is _ not _ .

Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 27]: Every hour brings fresh intelligence of the movements of the rebels , or patriots -- the last term is doubtful , yet it may be correct .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 47]: When they first opened the theatre at Botany Bay , Barrington spoke the prologue , which ended with these two lines : -- `` True _ Patriots _ we , for be it understood , We left our country , for our country 's good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 32]: In this view of the case , some of them , it is hoped , will turn out patriots before they die , if they have not been made so already .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 52]: Every hour comes in some poor wretch , who , for refusing to join the insurgents , has been made a beggar ; his cattle , sheep , and pigs driven away ; his fodder , his barns , his house , all that he possessed , now reduced to ashes .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 52]: The cold-blooded , heartless murder of Lieutenant Weir has , however , sufficiently raised the choler of the troops , without any further enormities on the part of the insurgents being requisite to that end : when an English soldier swears to shew no mercy , he generally keeps his word .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 64]: Of all wars , a civil war is the most cruel , the most unrelenting , and the most exterminating ; and deep indeed must be the responsibility of those , who , by their words or their actions , have contrived to set countryman against countryman , neighbour against neighbour , and very often brother against brother , and father against child .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 78]: On the morning of the -- the ice on the branch of the Ottawa river , which we had to cross , being considered sufficiently strong to bear the weight of the artillery , the whole force marched out , under the command of Sir John Colborne in person , to reduce the insurgents , who had fortified themselves at St Eustache and St Benoit , two towns of some magnitude in the district of Bois Brule .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 34]: The snow , as I before observed , lay very deep ; but by the time we started , the road had been well beaten down by the multitudes which had preceded us .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 39]: The effect of the whole line of troops , in their fur caps and great-coats , with the trains of artillery , ammunition , and baggage-waggons , as they wound along the snow-white road , was very beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 36]: It is astonishing how much more numerous the force , and how much larger the men and horses appeared to be , from the strong contrast of their colours with the wide expanse of snow .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 77]: As we passed one of the branches of the Ottawa , one of the ammunition-waggons falling through the ice , the horses were immediately all but choaked by the drivers -- a precaution which was novel to me , and a singular method of saving their lives : but such was the case : the air within them , rarified by heat , inflated their bodies like balloons , and they floated high on the water .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 46]: In this state they were easily disengaged from their traces , and hauled out upon the ice ; the cords which had nearly strangled them were then removed , and , in a few minutes , they recovered sufficiently to be led to the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 15]: Let it not be supposed that I am about to write a regular dispatch .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 56]: I went out with the troops , but was of about as much use as the fifth wheel of a coach ; with the exception , that as I rode one of Sir John Colborne 's horses , I was , perhaps , so far supplying the place of a groom who was better employed .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 47]: The town of St Eustache is very prettily situated on the high banks of the river , the most remarkable object being the Catholic church , a very large massive building , raised about two hundred yards from the river side , upon a commanding situation .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 63]: This church the insurgents had turned into a fortress , and perhaps , for a fortress '' _ d'occasion _ , '' there never was one so well calculated for a vigorous defence , it being flanked by two long stone-built houses , and protected in the rear by several lines of high and strong palisades , running down into the river .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 45]: The troops halted about three hundred yards from the town , to reconnoitre ; the artillery were drawn up and opened their fire , but chiefly with a view that the enemy , by returning the fire , might demonstrate their force and position .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 28]: These being ascertained , orders were given by Sir John Colborne , so that in a short time the whole town would be invested by the troops .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 21]: The insurgents perceiving this , many of them escaped , some through the town , others by the frozen river .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 59]: Those who crossed on the ice were chased by the volunteer dragoons , and the slipping and tumbling of the pursued and the pursuers , afforded as much merriment as interest ; so true it is , that any thing ludicrous will make one laugh , in opposition to the feelings of sympathy , anxiety , and fear .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 14]: Some of the runaways were cut down , and many more taken prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 57]: As soon as that portion of the troops which had entered the town , and marched up the main street towards the church , arrived within half-musket shot , they were received with a smart volley , which was fired from the large windows of the church , and which wounded a few of the men .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 107]: The soldiers were then ordered to make their approaches under cover of the houses ; and the artillery being brought up , commenced firing upon the church : but the walls of the building were much too solid for the shot to make any impression , and had the insurgents stood firm they certainly might have given a great deal of trouble , and probably have occasioned a severe loss of men ; but they became alarmed , and fired one of the houses which abutted upon and flanked the church , -- this they did with the view of escaping under cover of the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 37]: In a few minutes the church itself was obscured by the volumes of smoke thrown out ; and at the same time that the insurgents were escaping , the troops marched up and surrounded the church .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 30]: The poor wretches attempted to get away , either singly or by twos and threes ; but the moment they appeared a volley was discharged , and they fell .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 53]: Every attempt was made by the officers to make prisoners , but with indifferent success ; indeed , such was the exasperation of the troops at the murder of Lieut. Weir , that it was a service of danger to attempt to save the life of one of these poor deluded creatures .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 11]: The fire from the house soon communicated to the church .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 34]: Chenier , the leader , with ten others , the remnant of the insurgents who were in the church , rushed out ; there was one tremendous volley , and all was over .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 40]: By this time many other parts of the town were on fire , and there was every prospect of the whole of it being burnt down , leaving no quarters for the soldiers to protect them during the night .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 15]: The attention of everybody was therefore turned to prevent the progress of the flames .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 33]: Some houses were pulled down , so as to cut off the communication with the houses in the centre of the town , and in these houses the troops were billeted off .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 69]: The insurgents had removed their families , and most of their valuables and furniture , before our arrival ; but in one house were the commissariat stores , consisting of the carcases of all the cattle , sheep , pigs , etcetera , which they had taken from the loyal farmers ; there was a very large supply , and the soldiers were soon cooking in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 12]: The roll was called , men mustered , and order established .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 84]: The night was bitterly cold : the sky was clear , and the moon near to her full : houses were still burning in every direction , but they were as mere satellites to the lofty church , which was now one blaze of fire , and throwing out volumes of smoke , which passed over the face of the bright moon , and gave to her a lurid reddish tinge , as if she too had assisted in these deeds of blood .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 76]: The distant fires scattered over the whole landscape , which was one snow-wreath ; the whirling of the smoke from the houses which were burning close to us , and which , from the melting of the snow , were surrounded by pools of water , reflecting the fierce yellow flames , mingled with the pale beams of the bright moon -- this , altogether , presented a beautiful , novel , yet melancholy panorama .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 14]: I thought it might represent , in miniature , the burning of Moscow .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 42]: About midnight , when all was quiet , I walked up to the church , in company with one of Sir John Colborne 's aides-de-camp : the roof had fallen , and the flames had subsided for want of further aliment .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 72]: As we passed by a house which had just taken fire we heard a cry , and , on going up , found a poor wounded Canadian , utterly incapable of moving , whom the flames had just reached ; in a few minutes he would have been burned alive : we dragged him out , and gave him in charge of the soldiers , who carried him to the hospital .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 15]: But what was this compared to the scene which presented itself in the church !
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 73]: But a few weeks back , crowds were there , kneeling in adoration and prayer ; I could fancy the Catholic priests in their splendid stoles , the altar , its candlesticks and ornaments , the solemn music , the incense , and all that , by appealing to the senses , is so favourable to the cause of religion with the ignorant and uneducated ; and what did I now behold ?
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 27]: -- nothing but the bare and blackened walls , the glowing beams and rafters , and the window-frames which the flames still licked and flickered through .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 90]: The floor had been burnt to cinders , and upon and between the sleepers on which the floor had been laid , were scattered the remains of human creatures , injured in various degrees , or destroyed by the fire ; some with merely the clothes burnt off , leaving the naked body ; some burnt to a deep brown tinge ; others so far consumed that the viscera were exposed ; while here and there the blackened ribs and vertebra were all that the fierce flames had spared .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 18]: Not only inside of the church , but without its walls , was the same revolting spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 63]: In the remains of the small building used as a receptacle for the coffins previous to interment , were several bodies , heaped one upon another , and still burning , the trestles which had once supported the coffins serving as fuel ; and further off were bodies still unscathed by fire , but frozen hard by the severity of the weather .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 54]: I could not help thinking , as I stood contemplating this melancholy scene of destruction , bloodshed , and sacrilege , that if Mr Hume or Mr Roebuck had been by my side , they might have repented their inflammatory and liberal opinions , as here they beheld the frightful effects of them .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 7]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 48]: Crossing the river St Lawrence at this season of the year is not very pleasant , as you must force your passage through the large masses of ice , and are occasionally fixed among them ; so that you are swept down the current along with them .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 29]: Such was our case for about a quarter of an hour , and , in consequence , we landed about three miles lower down than we had intended .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 36]: The next day the navigation of the river , such as it was , was stopped , and in eight and forty hours heavy waggons and carts were passing over where we had floated across .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 34]: My course lay through what were termed the _ excited _ districts ; I had promised to pass through them , and supply the folks at Montreal with any information I could collect .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 60]: The weather was bitterly cold , and all communication was carried on by sleighs , a very pleasant mode of travelling when the roads are smooth , but rather fatiguing when they are uneven , as the sleigh then jumps from hill to hill , like an oyster-shell thrown by a boy to skim the surface of the water .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 55]: To defend myself from the cold , I had put on , over my coat , and under my cloak , a wadded black silk dressing-gown ; I thought nothing of it at the time , but I afterwards discovered that I was supposed to be one of the rebel priests escaping from justice .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 66]: Although still in the English dominions , I had not been over on the opposite side more than a quarter of an hour before I perceived that it would be just as well to hold my tongue ; and my adherence to this resolution , together with my supposed canonicals , were the cause of not a word being addressed to me by my fellow-travellers .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 23]: They presumed that I spoke French only , which they did not , and I listened in silence to all that passed .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 21]: It is strange how easily the American people are excited , and when excited , they will hesitate at nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 36]: The coach -LRB- for it was the stage-coach although represented by an open sleigh -RRB- , stopped at every town , large or small , every body eager to tell and to receive the news .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 57]: I always got out to warm myself at the stove in the bar , and heard all the remarks made upon what I do really believe were the most absurd and extravagant lies ever circulated -- lies which the very people who uttered them knew to be such , but which produced the momentary effect intended .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 46]: They were even put into the newspapers , and circulated every where ; and when the truth was discovered , they still remained uncontradicted , except by a general remark that such was the Tory version of the matter , and of course was false .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 123]: The majority of those who travelled with me were Americans who had crossed the St Lawrence in the same boat , and who must , therefore , have known well the whole circumstances attending the expedition against St Eustache ; but , to my surprise , at every place where we stopped they declared that there had been a battle between the insurgents and the King 's troops , in which the insurgents had been victorious ; that Sir John Colborne had been compelled to retreat to Montreal ; that they had themselves seen the troops come back -LRB- which was true -RRB- , and that Montreal was barricaded -LRB- which was also true -RRB- to prevent the insurgents from marching in .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 28]: I never said one word ; I listened to the exultations -- to the declarations of some that they should go and join the patriots , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 49]: One man amused me by saying -- `` I 've a great mind to go , but what I want is a good general to take the command ; I want a Julius Caesar , or a Bonaparte , or a Washington -- then I 'll go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 10]: I stopped for some hours at St Alban 's .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 49]: I was recommended to go to an inn , the landlord of which was said not to be of the democratic party , for the other two inns were the resort of the Sympathisers , -- and in these , consequently , scenes of great excitement took place .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 34]: The landlord put into my hand a newspaper , published that day , containing a series of resolutions , founded upon such falsehoods that I thought it might be advantageous to refute them .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 49]: I asked the landlord whether I could see the editor of the paper ; he replied that the party lived next door ; and I requested that he would send for him , telling him that I could give him information relative to the affair of St Eustache .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 39]: I had been shewn into a large sitting-room on the ground-floor , which I presumed was a private room , when the editor of the newspaper , attracted by the message I had sent him , came in .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 26]: I then pointed to the resolutions passed at the meeting , and asked him whether he would allow me to answer them in his paper .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 16]: His reply was , `` Certainly ; that his paper was open to all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 43]: `` Well , then , call in an hour , and I will by that time prove to you that they can only be excused or accounted for by the parties who framed them being totally ignorant of the whole affair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 13]: He went away , but did not return at the time requested .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 34]: It was not until late in the evening that he came ; and , avoiding the question of the resolutions , begged that I would give him the information relative to St Eustache .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 51]: As I presumed that , like most other editors in the United States , he dared not put in anything which would displease his subscribers , I said no more on that subject , but commenced dictating to him , while he wrote the particulars attending the St Eustache affair .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 68]: I was standing by the stove , giving the editor this information , when the door of the room opened , and in walked seven or eight people , who , without speaking , took chairs ; in a minute , another party of about the same number was ushered into the room by the landlord , who , I thought , gave me a significant look .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 38]: I felt surprised at what I thought an intrusion , as I had considered my room to be private ; however , I appeared to take no notice of it , and continued dictating to the editor .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 42]: The door opened again and again , and more chairs were brought in for the accommodation of the parties who entered , until at last the room was so full that I had but just room to walk round the stove .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 51]: Not a person said a word ; they listened to what I was dictating to the editor , and I observed that they all looked rather fierce ; but whether this was a public meeting , or what was to be the end of it , I had no idea .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 38]: At last , when I had finished , the editor took up his papers and left the room , in which I suppose there might have been from one hundred to a hundred and fifty persons assembled .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 34]: As soon as the door closed , one of them struck his thick stick on the floor -LRB- they most of them had sticks -RRB- , and gave a loud `` Hem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 14]: `` I believe , sir , that you are Captain M -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' replied I , `` that is my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 38]: `` We are informed , sir , by the gentleman who has just gone out , that you have asserted that our resolutions of yesterday could only be excused or accounted for from our total ignorance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 13]: Here he struck his stick again upon the floor , and paused .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 14]: thinks I to myself , `` the editor has informed against me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 43]: `` Now , sir , '' continued the spokesman , `` we are come to be enlightened ; we wish you to prove to us that we are totally ignorant ; you will oblige us by an explanation of your assertion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 5]: He was again silent .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 37]: -LRB- Thinks I to myself , I 'm in for it now , and if I get away without a broken head , or something worse , I am fortunate ; however , here goes . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 36]: Whereupon , without troubling the reader with what I did say , I will only observe , that I thought the best plan was to gain time by going back as far as I could .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 80]: I therefore commenced my oration at the period ; when the Canadas were surrendered to the English ; remarking upon the system which had been acted upon by our government from that time up to the present ; proving , as well as I could , that the Canadians had nothing to complain of , and that if England had treated her other American colonies as well , there never would have been a declaration of independence , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 2]: etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 24]: Having spoken for about an hour , and observing a little impatience on the part of some of my company , I stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 40]: Upon which , one rose and said , that there were several points not fully explained , referring to them one after another , whereupon `` the honourable member rose to explain , '' -- and was again silent .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 15]: Another then spoke , requesting information as to points not referred to by me .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 25]: I replied , and fortunately had an opportunity of paying the Americans a just compliment ; in gratitude for which their features relaxed considerably .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 17]: Perceiving this , I ventured to introduce a story or two , which made them laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 57]: After this , the day was my own ; for I consider the Americans , when not excited -LRB- which they too often are -RRB- , as a very good-tempered people : at all events , they wo n't break your head for making them laugh ; at least , such I found was the case .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 36]: We now entered freely into conversation ; some went away , others remained , and the affair ended by many of them shaking hands with me , and our taking a drink at the bar .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 62]: I must say , that the first appearances of this meeting were not at all pleasant ; but I was rightly served for my own want of caution , in so publicly stating , that the free and enlightened citizens of St Alban 's were very ignorant , and for opposing public opinion at a time when the greatest excitement prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 27]: I have mentioned this circumstance , as it threws a great deal of light upon the character of the Yankee or American of the Eastern States .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 57]: They would not suffer opposition to the majority to pass unnoticed -LRB- who , in England , would have cared what a stranger may have expressed as his opinion -RRB- ; but , at the same time , they gave me a patient hearing , to knew whether I could shew cause for what I said .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 34]: Had I refused this , I might have been very roughly handled ; but as I defended my observations , although they were not complimentary to them , they gave me fair play .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 33]: They were evidently much excited when they came into the room , but they gradually cooled down until convinced of the truth of my assertions ; and then all animosity was over .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 21]: The landlord said to me afterwards , `` I reckon you got out of that uncommon well , captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 21]: I perfectly agreed with him , and made a resolution to hold my tongue until I arrived at New York .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 35]: The next day , as I was proceeding on my journey , I fell in with General Brown , celebrated for running away so fast at the commencement of the fight at St Charles .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 9]: He had a very fine pair of mustachios .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 13]: We both warmed our toes at the same stove in solemn silence .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 5]: Sunday , at Burlington .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 30]: -- The young ladies are dressing up the church with festoons , and garlands of evergreens for the celebration of Christmas , and have pressed me into the service .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 48]: Last Sunday I was meditating over the blackened walls of the church at St Eustache , and the roasted corpses lying within its precincts ; now I am in another church , weaving laurel and cypress , in company with some of the prettiest creatures in creation .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 11]: As the copy-book says , _ variety is charming _ .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 7]: VOLUME ONE , CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 17]: Philadelphia is certainly , in appearance , the most wealthy and imposing city in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 53]: It is well built , and ornamented with magnificent public edifices of white marble ; indeed there is a great show of this material throughout the whole of the town , all the flights of steps to the doors , door-lintels , and window-sills , being very generally composed of this material .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 53]: The exterior of the houses , as well as the side pavement , are kept remarkably clean ; and there is no intermixture of commerce , as there is at New York , the bustle of business being confined to the Quays , and one or two streets adjoining the river side .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 67]: The first idea which strikes you when you arrive at Philadelphia , is that it is Sunday : every thing is so quiet , and there are so few people stirring ; but by the time that you have paraded half a dozen streets , you come to a conclusion that it must be Saturday , as that day is , generally speaking , a washing-day .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 47]: Philadelphia is so admirably supplied with water from the Schuykill water-works , that every house has it laid on from the attic to the basement ; and all day long they wash windows , door , marble step , and pavements in front of the houses .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 19]: Indeed , they have so much water , that they can afford to be very liberal to passers-by .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 98]: One minute you have a shower-bath from a negress , who is throwing water at the windows on the first floor ; and the next you have to hop over a stream across the pavement , occasioned by some black fellow , who , rather than go for a broom to sweep away any small portion of dust collected before his master 's door , brings out the leather hose , attached to the hydrants , as they term them here , and fizzes away with it till the stream has forced the dust into the gutter .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 11]: Of course , fire has no chance in this city .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 28]: Indeed , the two elements appear to have arranged that matter between them ; fire has the ascendant in New York , while water reigns in Philadelphia .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 61]: If a fire does break out here , the housekeepers have not the fear of being _ burnt _ to death before them ; for the water is poured on in such torrents , that the furniture is washed out of the windows , and all that they have to look out for , is to escape from being drowned .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 36]: The public institutions , such as libraries , museums , and the private cabinets of Philadelphia , are certainly very superior to those of any other city or town in America , Boston not excepted .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 55]: Every thing that is undertaken in this city is well done ; no expense is spared , although they are not so rapid in their movements as at New York : indeed the affluence and ease pervading the place , with the general cultivation which invariably attend them , are evident to a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 16]: Philadelphia has claimed for herself the title of the most aristocratic city in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 66]: If she refers to the aristocracy of wealth , I think she is justified ; but if she would say the aristocracy of family , which is much more thought of by the few who can claim it , she must be content to divide that with Boston , Baltimore , Charlestown , and the other cities which can date as far back as herself .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 54]: One thing is certain , that in no city is there so much fuss made about lineage and descent ; in no city are there so many cliques and sets in society , who keep apart from each other ; and it is very often difficult to ascertain the grounds of their distinctions .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 69]: One family will live at No. 1 , and another at No. 2 in the same street , both have similar establishments , both keep their carriages , both be well educated , and both may talk of their grandfathers and grandmothers ; and yet No. 1 will tell you that No. 2 is nobody , and you must not visit there ; and when you enquire why ?
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 16]: there is no other answer , but that they are not of the right sort .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 76]: As long as a portion are rich and a portion are poor , there is a line of demarcation easy to be drawn , even in a democracy ; but in Philadelphia , where there are so many in affluent circumstances , that line has been effaced , and they now seek an imaginary one , like the equinoctial , which none can be permitted to pass without going through the ceremonies of perfect ablution .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 42]: This social contest , as may be supposed , is carried on among those who have no real pretensions ; but there are many old and well-connected families in Philadelphia , whose claims are universally , although perhaps unwillingly , acknowledged .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 22]: I doubt if the claims of Boston to be the most scientific city in the Union , can be now established .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 31]: I met a greater number of scientific men in Philadelphia than I did in Boston ; and certainly the public and private collections in the former city are much superior .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 52]: The collection of shells and minerals belonging to Mr Lee , who is well known as an author and a naturalist , is certainly the most interesting I saw in the States , and I passed two days in examining it : it must have cost him much trouble and research .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 14]: The Girard College , when finished , will be a most splendid building .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 36]: It is , however , as they have now planned it , incorrect , according to the rules of architecture , in the number of columns on the sides in proportion to those in front .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 33]: This is a great pity ; perhaps the plan will be re-considered , as there is plenty of time to correct it , as well as money to defray the extra expense .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 20]: The water-works at Schuykill are well worth a visit , not only for their beauty , but their simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 30]: The whole of the river Schuykill is dammed up , and forms a huge water-power , which forces up the supply of water for the use of the city .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 48]: As I presume that river has a god as well as others , I can imagine his indignation , not only at his waters being diverted from his channel , but at being himself obliged to do all the work for the benefit of his tyrannical masters .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 49]: I have said that the museums of Philadelphia are far superior to most in the States ; but I may just as well here observe , that , as in many other things , a great improvement is necessary before they are such as they ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 50]: There is not only in these museums , but in all that I have ever entered in the United States , a want of taste and discrimination , of that correct feeling which characterises the real lovers of science , and knowledge of what is worthy of being collected .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 22]: They are such collections as would be made by school-boys and school-girls , not those of erudite professors and scientific men .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 55]: Side by side with the most interesting and valuable specimens , such as the fossil mammoth , etcetera , you have the greatest puerilities and absurdities in the world -- such as a cherry-stone formed into a basket , a fragment of the boiler of the Moselle steamer , and Heaven knows what besides .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 74]: Then you invariably have a large collection of daubs , called portraits , of eminent personages , one-half of whom a stranger never heard of -- but that is national vanity ; and lastly , I do not recollect to have seen a museum that had not a considerable portion of its space occupied by most execrable wax-work , in which the sleeping beauty -LRB- a sad misnomer -RRB- generally figures very conspicuously .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 75]: In some , they have models of celebrated criminals in the act of committing a murder , with the very hatchet or the very knife : or such trophies as the bonnet worn by Mrs -- when she was killed by her husband ; or the shirt , with the blood of his wife on it , worn by Jack Sprat , or whoever he might be , when he committed the bloody deed .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 27]: The most favourite subject , after the sleeping beauty in the wax-work , is General Jackson , with the battle of New Orleans in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 62]: Now all these things are very well in their places : exhibit wax-work as much as you please -- it amuses and interests children ; but the present collections in the museums remind you of American society -- a chaotic mass , in which you occasionally meet what is valuable and interesting , but of which the larger proportion is pretence .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 49]: It was not until I had been some time in Philadelphia that I became convinced how very superior the free coloured people were in intelligence and education , to what , from my knowledge of them in our West-India Islands , I had ever imagined them capable of .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 38]: Not that I mean to imply that they will ever attain to the same powers of intellect as the white man , for I really believe that the race are not formed for it by the Almighty .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 41]: I do not mean to say that there _ never _ will be great men among the African race , but that such instances will always be very _ rare _ , compared to the numbers produced among the white .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 36]: But this is certain , that in Philadelphia the free coloured people are a very respectable class , and , in my opinion , quite as intelligent as the more humble of the free whites .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 33]: I have been quite surprised to see them take out their pencils , write down and calculate with quickness and precision , and in every other point shew great intelligence and keenness .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 10]: In this city they are both numerous and wealthy .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 39]: The most extravagant funeral I saw in Philadelphia was that of a black ; the coaches were very numerous , as well as the pedestrians , who were all well dressed , and behaving with the utmost decorum .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 16]: They were preceded by a black clergyman , dressed in his full black silk canonicals .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 10]: He did look very odd , I must confess .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 23]: Singular is the degree of contempt and dislike in which the free blacks are held in all the free States of America .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 47]: They are deprived of their rights as citizens ; and the white pauper , who holds out his hand for charity -LRB- and there is no want of beggars in Philadelphia -RRB- , will turn away from a negro , or coloured man , with disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 15]: It is the same thing in the Eastern States , notwithstanding their religious professions .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 27]: In fact , in the United States , a negro , from his colour , and I believe his colour alone , is a degraded being .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 21]: Is not this extraordinary , in a land which professes universal liberty , equality , and the rights of man ?
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 8]: In England this is not the case .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 25]: In private society no one objects to sit in company with a man of colour , provided he has the necessary education and respectability .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 100]: Nor , indeed , is it the case in the Slave States , where I have frequently seen a lady in a public conveyance with her negress sitting by her , and no objection has been raised by the other parties in the coach ; but in the Free States a man of colour is not admitted into a stage coach ; and in all other public places , such as theatres , churches , etcetera , there is always a portion divided off for the negro population , that they may not be mixed up with the whites .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 16]: When I first landed at New York , I had a specimen of this feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 48]: Fastened by a rope yarn to the rudder chains of a vessel next in the tier , at the wharf to which the packet had hauled in , I perceived the body of a black man , turning over and over with the ripple of the waves .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 26]: I was looking at it , when a lad came up : probably his curiosity was excited by my eyes being fixed in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 25]: He looked , and perceiving the object , turned away with disdain , saying , `` Oh , it 's only a nigger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 20]: And all the Free States in America respond to the observation , `` It 's only a nigger . ''

Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 14]: At the time that I was at Philadelphia a curious cause was decided .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 62]: A coloured man of the name of James Fortin , who was , I believe , a sailmaker by profession , but at all events a person not only of the highest respectability , but said to be worth 150,000 dollars , appealed because he was not permitted to vote at elections , and claimed his right as a free citizen .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 56]: The cause was tried , and the verdict , a very lengthy one , was given by the judge against him , I have not that verdict in my possession ; but I have the opinion of the Supreme Court on one which was given before , and I here insert it as a curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 110]: It is a remarkable feature in the tyranny and injustice of this case , that although James Fortin was not considered white enough -LRB- he is , I believe , a mulatto -RRB- to _ vote _ as a citizen , he has always been quite white enough to be _ taxed _ as one , and has to pay his proportion , -LRB- which , from the extent of his business , is no trifle -RRB- of all the rates and assessments considered requisite for the support of the poor , and improving and beautifying that city , of which he is declared not to be a citizen .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 79]: Although the decision of the Supreme Court enters into a lengthened detail , yet as it is very acute and argumentative , and touches upon several other points equally anomalous to the boasted freedom of the American institutions , I wish the reader would peruse it carefully , as it will amply repay him for his trouble ; and it is that he _ may _ read it , that I have not inserted it in an Appendix .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 51]: The question arose upon a writ of error to the judgment of the Common Pleas of Luzerne county , in an action by Wm. Fogg , a negro , against Hiram Hobbs , inspector , and Levi Baldwin and others , judges of the election , for refusing his vote .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 8]: In the Court below the plaintiff recovered .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 24]: The Supreme Court being of opinion that a negro has not a right to vote under the present constitution , reversed the judgment .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 6]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ `` Respectfully , FRED .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 2]: WATTS .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 11]: `` Wm. Fogg _ versus _ Hiram Hobbs and others .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 13]: `` The opinion of the Court was delivered by Gibson , CJ .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 85]: `` This record raises , a second time , the only question on a phrase in the Constitution which has occurred since its adoption ; and , however partisans may have disputed the clearness and precision of phraseology , we have often been called upon to enforce its limitations of legislative power ; but the business of interpretation was incidental , and the difficulty was not in the diction , but in the uncertainty of the act to which it was to be applied .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 17]: I have said a question on the meaning of a phrase has arisen a second time .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 18]: It would be more accurate to say the _ same _ question has arisen the second time .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 42]: About the year 1795 , as I have it from James Gibson , Esquire , of the Philadelphia bar , the very point before us was ruled by the High Court of Errors and Appeals against the right of negro suffrage .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 27]: Mr Gibson declined an invitation to be concerned in the argument , and therefore has no memorandum of the cause to direct us to the record .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 26]: I have had the office searched for it ; but the papers had fallen into such disorder as to preclude a hope of its discovery .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 13]: Most of them were imperfect , and many were lost or misplaced .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 17]: But Mr Gibson 's remembrance of the decision is perfect , and entitled to full confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 49]: That the case was not reported , is probably owing to the fact that the judges gave no reasons ; and the omission is the more to be regretted , as a report of it would have put the question at rest , and prevented much unpleasant excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 13]: Still , the judgment is not the less authoritative as a precedent .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 44]: Standing as the court of last resort , that tribunal bore the name relation to this court that the Supreme Court does to the Common Pleas ; and as its authority could not be questioned then , it can not be questioned now .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 14]: The point , therefore , is not open to discussion on original grounds .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 25]: `` But the omission of the judges renders it proper to show that their decision was founded in the true principles of the constitution .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 65]: In the first section of the third article it is declared , that ` in elections by the citizens , every _ freeman _ of the age of twenty-one years , having resided in the State two years before the election , and having within that time paid _ a state or county tax _ , ' shall enjoy the rights of an elector .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 68]: Now , the argument of those who assert the claim of the coloured population is , that a negro is a _ man _ ; and when not held to involuntary service , that he is free , consequently that he is a _ freeman _ ; and if a freeman in the common acceptation of the term , then a freeman in every acceptation of it .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 26]: This pithy and syllogistic sentence comprises the whole argument , which , however elaborated , perpetually goes back to the point from which it started .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 32]: The fallacy of it is its assumption that the term ` freedom ' signifies nothing but exemption from involuntary service ; and that it has not a legal signification more specific .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 51]: The freedom of a municipal corporation , or body politic , implies fellowship and participation , of corporate rights ; but an inhabitant of an incorporated place , who is neither servant nor slave , though bound by its laws , may be no freeman in respect to its government .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 65]: It has indeed been affirmed by text writers , that habitance , paying scot and lot , give an incidental right to corporate freedom ; but the courts have refused to acknowledge it , even when the charter seemed to imply it ; and when not derived from prescription or grant , it has been deemed a qualification merely , and not a title .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 7]: -LRB- _ Wilcox _ , chap .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 2]: iii .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 4]: p. 456 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 33]: Let it not be said that the legal meaning of the word freeman is peculiar to British corporations , and that we have it not in the charters and constitutions of Pennsylvania .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 196]: The laws agreed upon in England in May 1682 , use the word in this specific sense , and even furnish a definition of it : ` Every inhabitant of the said province that is , or shall be , a purchaser of one hundred acres of land or upwards , his heirs or assigns , and every person who shall have paid his passage , and shall have taken up one hundred acres of land , at a penny an acre , and have cultivated ten acres thereof ; and every person that hath been a servant or bondsman , and is free by his service , that shall have taken up his fifty acres of land , and shall have cultivated twenty thereof ; and every inhabitant , artificer , or other resident in the said province , that pays scot and lot to the government , _ shall be deemed and accounted a * freeman * of the said province _ ; and every such person shall be capable of electing , or being elected , representatives of the people in provincial council , or general assembly of the said province . '
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 9]: Now , why this minute and elaborate detail ?
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 28]: Had it been intended that all but servants and slaves should be freemen to every intent , it had been easier and more natural to say so .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 6]: But it was not intended .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 53]: It was foreseen that there would be inhabitants , neither planters nor taxable , who , though free as the winds , might be unsafe depositories of popular power ; and the design was , to admit no man to the freedom of the province who had not a stake in it .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 41]: That the clause which relates to freedom by service was not intended for manumitted slaves is evident , from the fact that there were none ; and it regarded not slavery , but limited servitude expired by efflux of time .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 88]: At that time , certainly , the case of a manumitted slave , or of his free-born progeny , was not contemplated as one to be provided for in the founder 's scheme of policy : I have quoted the passage , however , to show that the word freeman was applied in a peculiar sense to the political compact of our ancestors , resting like a corporation , on a charter from the crown ; and exactly as it was applied to bodies politic at home .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 129]: In entire consonance , it was declared in the Act of Union , given at Chester in the same year , that strangers and foreigners holding land ` according to the law of a freeman , ' and promising obedience to the proprietary , as well as allegiance to the crown , ` shall be held and reputed freemen of the province and counties aforesaid ; ' and it was further declared , that when a foreigner ` shall make his request to the governor of the province _ for the aforesaid freedom _ , the same person shall be _ admitted _ on the conditions herein expressed , paying twenty shillings sterling , and no more : ' -- modes of expression peculiarly appropriate to corporate fellowship .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 106]: The word in the same sense pervades the charter of privileges , the act of settlement , and the act of naturalisation , in the preamble to the last of which it was said , that some of the inhabitants were ` foreigners and not freemen , according to the acceptation of the laws of England ; ' it held its place also in the legislative style of enactment down to the adoption of the present constitution ; after which , the words ` by and with the advice and consent of the freemen , ' were left out , and the present style substituted .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 48]: Thus , till the instant when the phrase on which the question turns was penned , the term freeman had a peculiar and specific sense , being used like the term citizen , which supplanted it , to denote one who had a voice in public affairs .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 50]: The citizens were denominated freemen even in the constitution of 1776 ; and under the present constitution , the word , though dropped in the style , was used in legislative acts , convertible with electors , so late as the year 1798 , when it grew into disuse .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 41]: In an act passed the 4th of April in that year for the establishment of certain election districts , it was , for the first time , used indiscriminately with that word ; since when it has been entirely disused .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 62]: Now , it will not be pretended , that the legislature meant to have it inferred , that every one not a freeman within the purview , should be deemed a slave ; and how can a convergent intent be collected from the same word in the constitution , that every one not a slave is to be accounted an elector ?
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 58]: Except for the word citizen , which stands in the context also as a term of qualification , an affirmance of these propositions would extend the right of suffrage to aliens ; and to admit of any exception to the argument , its force being derived from the supposed universality of the term , would destroy it .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 28]: Once concede that there may be a freeman in one sense of it , who is not so in another , and the whole ground is surrendered .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 19]: In what sense , then , must the convention of 1790 be supposed to have used the term ?

Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 3]: 169 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 56]: On this principle , it is difficult to discover how the word freeman , as used in previous public acts , could have been meant to comprehend a coloured race : as well might it be supposed , that the declaration of universal and unalienable freedom in both our constitutions was meant to comprehend it .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 37]: Nothing was ever more comprehensively predicted , and a practical enforcement of it would have liberated every slave in the State ; yet mitigated slavery long continued to exist among us , in derogation of it .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 64]: Rules of interpretation demand a strictly verbal construction of nothing but a penal statute ; and a constitution is to be construed still more liberally than even a remedial one , because a convention legislating for masses , can do little more than mark an outline of fundamental principles , leaving the interior gyrations and details to be filled up by ordinary legislation .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 27]: ` Conventions intended to regulate the conduct of nations , ' said Chief Justice Tilghman , in the Farmers ' Bank versus Smith , 3 Sergt .

Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 20]: It is of little importance to the public , whether a tract of land belongs to A or B .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 33]: In deciding these titles , strict rules of construction may be adhered to ; and it is best that they should be adhered to , though sometimes at the expense of justice .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 27]: But where multitudes are to be affected by the construction of an amendment , great regard is to be paid to the spirit and intention . '
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 21]: What better key to these , than the tone of antecedent legislation discoverable in the application of the disputed terms .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 26]: `` But in addition to interpretation from usage , this antecedent legislation furnishes other proofs that no coloured race was party to our social compact .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 79]: As was justly remarked by President Fox , in the matter of the late contested election , our ancestors settled the province as a community of white men , and the blacks were introduced into it as a race of slaves , whence an unconquerable prejudice of caste , which has come down to our day , insomuch that a suspicion of taint still has the unjust effect of sinking the subject of it below the common level .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 22]: Consistently with this prejudice , is it to be credited that parity of rank would be allowed to such a race ?
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 103]: Let the question be answered by the statute of 1726 , which denominated it an idle and a slothful people ; which directed the magistrates to bind out free negroes for laziness or vagrancy ; which forbade them to harbour Indian or mulatto slaves , on pain of punishment by fine , or to deal with negro slaves , on pain of stripes ; which annexed to the interdict of marriage with a white , the penalty of reduction to slavery ; which punished them for tippling with stripes , and even a white person with servitude for intermarriage with a negro .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 29]: If freemen , in a political sense , were subjects of these cruel and degrading oppressions , what must have been the lot of their brethren in bondage ?
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 23]: It is also true , that degrading conditions were sometimes assigned to white men , but never as members of a caste .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 37]: Insolvent debtors , to indicate the worst of them , are compelled to make satisfaction by servitude ; but that was borrowed from a kindred , and still less rational , principle of the common law .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 68]: This act of 1726 , however , remained in force , till it was repealed by the Emancipating Act of 1789 ; and it is irrational to believe , that the progress of liberal sentiments was so rapid in the next ten years , -- as to produce a determination in the convention of 1790 to raise this depressed race to the level of the white one .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 34]: If such were its purpose , it is strange that the word chosen to effect it should have been the very one chosen by the convention of 1776 to designate a white elector .

Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 54]: Now , if the word freeman were not potent enough to admit a free negro to suffrage under the first constitution , it is difficult to discern a degree of magic in the intervening plan of emancipation sufficient to give it potency , in the apprehension of the convention , under the second .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 84]: `` The only thing in the history of the convention which casts a doubt upon the intent , is the fact , that the word _ white _ was prefixed to the word freeman in the report of the committee , and _ subsequently struck _ out -- probably because it was thought superfluous , or still more probably , because it was feared that respectable men of dark complexion would often be insulted at the polls , by objections to their colour .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 20]: I have heard it said , that Mr Gallatin sustained his motion to strike out on the latter ground .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 27]: Whatever the motive , the disseverence is insufficient to wrap the interpretation of a word of such settled and determinate meaning as the one which remained .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 63]: A legislative body speaks to the judiciary , only through its final act , and expresses its will in the words of it ; and though their meaning may be influenced by the sense in which they have usually been applied to extrinsic matters , we can not receive an explanation of them from what has been moved or said in debate .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 14]: The place of a judge is his forum -- not the legislative hall .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 78]: Were he even disposed to pry into the motives of the members , it would be impossible for him to ascertain them ; and , in attempting to discover the ground on which the conclusion was obtained , it is not probable that a member of the majority could indicate any that was common to all ; previous prepositions are merged in the act of consummation , and the interpreter of it must look to that alone .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 40]: `` I have thought it fair to treat the question as it stands affected by our own municipal regulations , without illustration from those of other States , where the condition of the race has been still less favoured .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 36]: Yet it is proper to say , that the second section of the fourth article of the Federal Constitution presents an obstacle to the political freedom of the negro , which seems to be insuperable .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 48]: It is to be remembered that citizenship , as well as freedom , is a constitutional qualification ; and how it could be conferred , so as to overbear the laws , imposing countless disabilities on him in other States , is a problem of difficult solution .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 28]: In this aspect , the question becomes one , not of intention , but of power ; so doubtful , as to forbid the exercise of it .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 31]: Every man must lament the necessity of the disabilities ; but slavery is to be dealt with by those whose existence depends on the skill with which it is treated .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 87]: Considerations of mere humanity , however , belong to a class with which , as judges , we have nothing to do ; and , interpreting the constitution in the spirit of our own institutions , we are bound to pronounce that men of colour are destitute of title to the elective franchise : their blood , however , may become so diluted in successive descent , as to lose its distinctive character ; and then both policy and justice require that previous disabilities should cease .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 52]: By the amended constitution of North Carolina , no free negro , mulatto , or free person of mixed blood , descended from negro ancestors to the fourth generation inclusive , _ though one ancestor of each generation may have been a white person _ , shall vote for the legislature .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 68]: I regret to say , no similar regulation , for practical purposes , has been attempted here ; in consequence of which , every case of disputed colour must be determined by no particular rule , but by the discretion of the judges ; and thus a great constitutional right , even under the proposed amendments of the constitution , will be left the sport of caprice .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 29]: In conclusion , we are of opinion the court erred in directing that the plaintiff could have his action against the defendant for the rejection of his vote .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 4]: Judgment reversed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 36]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ It will be observed by those who have had patience to read through so long a legal document , that reference is made to the unjust prejudice against any taint of the African blood .

Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 5]: What is the consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 55]: Why , it is considered that by so doing he has outraged society ; and whenever they want to raise a cry against him , this is the charge , and very injurious it is to his popularity , -- `` that he has done his duty as a father and a Christian . ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 12]: `` Captain Marryat , we are a very moral people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 21]: The laws of the State relative to the intermarriage of the whites with the coloured population are also referred to .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 56]: A case of this kind took place at New York when I was there ; and as soon as the ceremony was over , the husband , I believe it was , but either the husband or the wife , was seized by the mob , and put under the pump for half an hour .

Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 17]: It also refers to the white slavery , which was not abolished until the year 1789 .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 50]: Previous to that period , a man who arrived out , from the old continent , and could not pay his passage , was put up to auction for the amount of his debt , and was compelled to serve until he had worked it out with the purchaser .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 30]: But not only for the debt of passage-money , but for other debts , a white man was put up to auction , and sold to the best bidder .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 82]: They tell a curious story , for the truth of which I can not vouch , of a lawyer , a very clever but dissipated and extravagant man , who , having contracted large debts and escaped to New Jersey , was taken and put up to auction ; a keen Yankee purchased him , and took him regularly round to all the circuits to plead causes , and made a very considerable sum out of him before his time expired .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 20]: I have observed that Mr Fortin , the coloured man , was considered quite white enough to pay taxes .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 24]: It is usually considered in this country , that by going to America you avoid taxation , but such is not the case .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 8]: The municipal taxes are not very light .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 21]: I could not obtain any very satisfactory estimates from the other cities , but I gained thus much from Philadelphia .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 6]: The assessments are on property .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 11]: City Tax , 70 cents upon the 100 dollars valuation .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 8]: County Tax , 65 cents upon ditto .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 9]: _ Poor 's _ Rate , 40 cents .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 8]: Taxes on Horses , 1 dollar each .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 9]: Taxes on Dogs , half a dollar each .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 15]: _ Poll _ Tax , from a quarter dollar to 4 dollars each person .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 34]: It is singular that such a tax as the _ poll _ tax , that which created the insurrection of Wat Tyler in England , should have forced its way into a democracy .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 18]: In the collection of their taxes , they are quite as summary as they are in England .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 36]: This is the notice : `` You are hereby informed , that your property is included in a list of delinquents now preparing , and will be advertised and sold for the assessments due thereon .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 8]: -LRB- This being the last call . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 16]: `` Your immediate attention will save the costs of advertising , sale , etcetera . ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 3]: -- Collector .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 13]: `` Collector 's Office , Number 1 , State of -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 84]: It is a strange fact , and one which must have attracted the reader 's notice , that there should be a poor 's rate in America , where there is work for every body ; and still stranger that there should be one in the city of Philadelphia , in which , perhaps , there are more beneficent and charitable institutions than in any city in the world of the same population : notwithstanding this there are many mendicants in the street .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 54]: All this arises from the advantage taken of an unwise philanthropy in the first place , many people preferring to live upon alms in preference to labour ; and next from the state of destitution to which many of the emigrants are reduced after their arrival , and before they can obtain employment .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 35]: Indeed , not only Philadelphia , but Baltimore and New York , are equally charged for the support of these people -- the two first by legal enactment , the latter by voluntary subscription .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 31]: And it is much to the credit of the inhabitants of all these cities that the charge is paid cheerfully , and that an appeal is never made in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 56]: But let the Americans beware : the poor rate at present is trifling -- 40 cents in the 100 dollars , or about 1.75 pence in the pound ; but they must recollect , that they were not more in England about half a century back , and see to what they have risen now !
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 8]: It is the principle which is bad .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 50]: There are now in Philadelphia more than 1,500 paupers , who live entirely upon the public , but who , if relief had not been continued to them , would , in all probability , by this time , have found their way to where their labour is required .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 39]: The Philadelphians are proverbially generous and charitable ; but they should remember that in thus yielding to the dictates of their hearts , they are sowing the seeds of what will prove a bitter curse to their posterity .

Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 4]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note 1 .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 28]: `` On the whole , I can not help considering it a mistake to suppose that slavery has been abolished in the Northern States of the Union .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 40]: It is true , indeed , that in these States the power of compulsory labour no longer exists ; and that one human being within their limits can no longer claim property in the thews and sinews of another .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 13]: But is this all that is implied in the boon of freedom ?
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 32]: if the word mean anything , it must mean the enjoyment of equal rights , and the unfettered exercise in each individual of such powers and faculties as God has given .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 42]: In this true meaning of the word , it may be safely asserted that this poor degraded class are still slaves -- they are subject to the most grinding and humiliating of all slaveries , that of universal and unconquerable prejudice .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 35]: The whip , indeed , has been removed from the back of the negro ; but the chains are still upon his limbs , and he bears the brand of degradation on his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 31]: What is it but the mere abuse of language to call him _ free _ , who is tyrannically deprived of all the motives to exertion which animate other men ?
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 24]: The law , in truth , has left him in that most pitiable of all conditions -- _ a masterless slave _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 11]: -- _ Hamilton 's Men and Manners in America _ .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 4]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note 2 .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 70]: Miss Martineau , who is not always wrong , in her remarks upon pauperism in the United States , observes : -- `` The amount , altogether , is far from commensurate with the charity of the community ; and it is to be hoped that the curse of a legal charity will be avoided in a country where it certainly can not become necessary within any assignable time .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 54]: I was grieved to see the magnificent Pauper Asylum near Philadelphia , made to accommodate , luxuriously , 1,200 persons ; and to have its arrangements pointed out to me , as yielding more comforts to the inmates than the labourer could secure at home by any degree of industry and prudence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 2]: Washington .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 29]: Here are assembled from every State in the Union what ought to be the collected talent , intelligence , and high principle of a free and enlightened nation .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 36]: Of talent and intelligence there is a very fair supply , but principle is not so much in demand ; and in everything , and everywhere , by the demand the supply is always regulated .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 21]: Everybody knows that _ Washington _ has a Capitol ; but the misfortune is that the Capitol wants a city .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 47]: There it stands , reminding you of a general without an army , only surrounded and followed by a parcel of ragged little dirty boys , for such is the appearance of the dirty , straggling , ill-built houses which lie at the foot of it .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 63]: Washington , notwithstanding , is an agreeable city , full of pleasant clever people , who come there to amuse and be amused ; and you observe in the company -LRB- although you occasionally meet some very queer importations from the Western settlements -RRB- much more _ usage du monde _ and continental ease than in any other parts of the State .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 50]: A large portion of those who come up for the meeting of Congress , as well as of the residents , having travelled , and thereby gained more respect for other nations , are consequently not so conceited about their own country as are the majority of other Americans .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 33]: If anything were required to make Washington a more agreeable place than it is at all times , the arrival and subsequent conduct of Mr Fox as British Ambassador would be sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 71]: His marked attention to all Americans of respectability : his _ empressement _ in returning the calls of English gentlemen who may happen to arrive , his open house ; his munificent allowance dedicated wholly to the giving of fetes and dinner parties as his Sovereign 's representative ; and , above all , his excessive urbanity , can never be forgotten by those who have ever visited the Capitol .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 38]: The Chamber of the House of Representatives is a fine room , and taking the average of the orations delivered there , it possesses this one great merit -- _ you can not hear in it _ .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 33]: Were I to make a comparison between the members of our House of Commons and those of the House of Representatives , I should say that the latter had certainly real advantages .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 38]: In the first place ; the members of the American Senate and House of Representatives are paid , not only their travelling expenses to and fro , but eight dollars a day during the sitting of Congress .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 31]: Out of these allowances many save money , and those who do not , are at all events enabled to bring their families up to Washington for a little amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 34]: In the next place , they are so comfortably accommodated in the house , every man having his own well-stuffed arm-chair , and before him his desk , with his papers and notes !
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 55]: Then they are supplied with everything , even to pen-knives with their names engraved on them -- each knife having two pen-blades , one whittling blade , and a fourth to clean their nails with , showing on the part of the government , a paternal regard for their cleanliness as well as convenience .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 16]: Moreover , they never work at night , and do very little during the day .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 47]: It is astonishing how little work they get through in a session at Washington : this is owing to every member thinking himself obliged to make two or three speeches , not for the good of the nation , but for the benefit of his constituents .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 21]: These speeches are printed and sent to them , to prove that their member makes some noise in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 17]: The subject upon which he speaks is of little consequence , compared to the sentiments expressed .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 20]: It must be full of eagles , star-spangled banners , sovereign people , clap-trap , flattery , and humbug .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 108]: I have said that very little business is done in these houses ; but this is caused not only by their long-winded speeches about nothing , but by the fact that both parties -LRB- in this respect laudably following the example of the old country -RRB- are chiefly occupied , the one with the paramount and vital consideration of keeping in , and the other with that of getting in , -- thus allowing the business of the nation , -LRB- which after all is not very important , unless such a trump as the Treasury Bill turns up , -RRB- to become a very secondary consideration .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 24]: And yet there are principle and patriotism among the members of the legislature , and the more to be appreciated from their rarity .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 57]: Like the seeds of beautiful flowers , which , when cast upon a manure-heap , spring up in greater luxuriance and beauty , and yield a sweeter perfume from the rankness which surrounds them , so do these virtues show with more grace and attractiveness from the hot-bed of corruption in which they have been engendered .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 24]: But there has been a sad falling-off in America since the last war , which brought in the democratic party with General Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 43]: America , if she would wish her present institutions to continue , must avoid war ; the best security for her present form of government existing another half century , is a state of tranquillity and peace ; but of that hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 38]: As for the party at present in power , all I can say in its favour is , that there are three clever gentlemen in it -- Mr Van Buren , Mr Poinsett , and Mr Forsyth .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 36]: There may be more , but I know so little of them , that I must be excused if I do not name them , which otherwise I should have had great pleasure in doing .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 30]: Mr Van Buren is a very gentleman-like , intelligent man ; very proud of talking over his visit to England , and the English with whom he was acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 54]: It is remarkable that , although at the head of the democratic party , Mr Van Buren has taken a step striking at the very roots of their boasted equality , and one on which General Jackson did not venture -- i.e. he has prevented the mobocracy from intruding themselves at his levees .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 18]: The police are now stationed at the door , to prevent the intrusion of any improper person .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 57]: A few years ago , a fellow would drive his cart , or hackney coach , up to the door ; walk into the saloon in all his dirt , and force his way to the president , that he might shake him by the one hand ; whilst he flourished his whip in the other .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 31]: The revolting scenes which took place when refreshments were handed round , the injury done to the furniture , and the disgust of the ladies , may be well imagined .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 34]: Mr Van Buren deserves great credit for this step , for it was a bold one ; but I must not praise him too much , or he may lose his next election .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 22]: The best lounge at Washington is the library of the Capitol , but the books are certainly not very well treated .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 43]: I saw a copy of Audubon 's Ornithology , and many other valuable works , in a very dilapidated state , but this must be the case when the library is open to all , and there are so many juvenile visitors .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 19]: Still it is much better than locking it up , for only the bindings to be looked at .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 20]: It is not a library for show , but for use , and is a great comfort and amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 30]: There are three things in great request amongst Americans of all classes , -- male , I mean , -- to wit , oysters , spirits , and tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 25]: The first and third are not prohibited by Act of Congress and may be sold in the Capitol , but spirituous liquors may not .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 20]: I wondered how the members could get on without them , but upon this point I was soon enlightened .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 13]: Below the basement of the building is an oyster shop and refectory .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 31]: The refectory has been permitted by Congress upon the express stipulation that no spirituous liquors should be sold there , but law-makers are too often law-breakers all over the world .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 55]: You go there and ask for pale sherry , and they hand you gin ; brown sherry , and it is brandy ; madeira , whisky ; and thus do these potent , grave , and reverend signors evade their own laws , beneath the very hall wherein they were passed in solemn conclave .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 14]: It appears that tobacco is considered very properly as an article of fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 40]: At a store close to the hotel , the board outside informs you that among fashionable requisites to be found there , are gentlemen 's shirts , collars , gloves , silk handkerchiefs , and the best chewing tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 33]: But not only at Washington but at other large towns I have seen at silk-mercers and hosiers this notice stuck up in the window -- '' _ Dulcissimus _ chewing tobacco . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 74]: So prevalent is the habit of chewing , and so little , from long custom , do the ladies care about it , that I have been told that many young ladies in the South carry , in their work-boxes , etcetera , pigtail , nicely ornamented with gold and coloured papers ; and when their swains are at fault administer to their wants , thus meriting their affections by such endearing solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 33]: I was rather amused in the Senate at hearing the claims of parties who had suffered during the last war , and had hitherto not received any redress , discussed for adjudication .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 27]: One man 's claim , for instance , was for a cow , value thirty dollars , eaten up , of course , by the Britishers .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 40]: It would naturally be supposed that such claims were unworthy of the attention of such a body as the Senate , or , when brought forward , would have been allowed without comment : but it was not so .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 39]: The member who saves the public money always finds favour in the eyes of the people , and therefore every member tries to save as much as he can , except when he is himself a party concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 36]: And there was as much arguing and objecting , and discussion of the merits of this man 's claim , as there would be in the English House of Commons at passing the Navy Estimates .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 5]: Eventually he lost it .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 22]: The claims of the Fulton family were also brought forward , when I was present , in the House of Representatives .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 30]: Fulton was certainly the father of steam-navigation in America , and to his exertions and intelligence America may consider herself in a great degree indebted for her present prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 22]: It once required six or seven months to ascend the Mississippi , a passage which is now performed in fifteen days .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 40]: Had it not been for Fulton 's genius , the West would still have remained a wild desert , and the now flourishing cotton-growing States would not yet have yielded the crops which are the staple of the Union .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 39]: The claim of his surviving relatives was a mere nothing , in comparison with the debt of gratitude owing to that great man : yet member after member rose to oppose it with all the ingenuity of argument .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 61]: One asserted that the merit of the invention did not belong to Fulton ; another , that even if it did , his relatives certainly could found no claim upon it ; a third rose and declared that he would prove that , so far from the government owing money to Fulton , Fulton was in debt to the government .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 43]: And thus did they go on , showing to their constituents how great was their consideration for the public money , and to the world -LRB- if another proof were required -RRB- how little gratitude is to be found in a democracy .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 31]: The bill was thrown out , and the race of Fultons left to the chance of starving , for anything that the American nation seemed to care to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 33]: Whitney , the inventor of the gin for clearing the cotton of its seeds -LRB- perhaps the next greatest boon ever given to America -RRB- , was treated in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 108]: And yet , on talking over the question , there were few of the members who did not individually acknowledge the justice of their claims , and the duty of the State to attend to them : but the _ majority _ would not have permitted it , and when they went back to their constituents to be re-elected , it would have been urged against them that they had voted away the public money , and they would have had the difficult task of proving that the interests of the _ majority _ , and of the majority alone , had regulated their conduct in Congress .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 35]: There was one event of exciting interest which occurred during my short stay at Washington , and which engrossed the minds of every individual : the fatal duel between Mr Graves and Mr Cilley .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 27]: Not only the duel itself , but what took place after it , was to me , as a stranger , a subject for grave reflection .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 37]: Notice of Mr Cilley 's decease having been formally given to the House , it adjourned for a day or two , as a mark of respect , and a day was appointed for the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 23]: The coffin containing the body was brought into the House of Representatives , and there lay in state , as it were .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 65]: The members of Senate and the Supreme Court were summoned to attend , whilst an eulogium was passed on the merits and virtues of the deceased by the surviving representative of the State of Maine : the funeral sermon was delivered by one clergyman , and an exhortation by another , after which the coffin was carried out to be placed in the hearse .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 54]: The following printed order of the procession was distributed , that it might be rigidly attended to by the members of the two Houses and the Supreme Court : -- Order of Arrangements for the Funeral of The Hon. Jonathan Cilley , Late a Representative in Congress , from the State of Maine .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 72]: The Committee of Arrangement , Pall-bearers , and Mourners , will attend at the late residence of the deceased , at Mr Birth 's , in third-street , at 11 o'clock AM , Tuesday , February 27th ; at which time the remains will be removed , in charge of the Committee of Arrangements , attended by the Serjeant-at-arms of the House of Representatives , to the hall of the House .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 45]: At 12 o'clock , meridian , funeral service will be performed in the hall of the House of Representatives , and immediately after the procession will move to the place of interment , in the following order , -- The Chaplains of both Houses .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 12]: Committee of Arrangement , viz : Mr Evans , of Maine .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 6]: Mr Atherton , of NH .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 6]: Mr Coles , of Va. .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 6]: Mr Conner , of NC .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 6]: Mr Johnson , of La. .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 12]: Mr Whittlesey , of Ohio , Mr Fillmore , of NV .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 10]: Pall-bearers , viz : Mr Thomas , of Maryland .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 6]: Mr Campbell , of SC .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 6]: Mr Williams , of NH .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 6]: Mr White , of Indiana .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 6]: Mr Ogle , of Pennsylvania .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 6]: Mr Martin , of Ala. .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 8]: The Family and Friends of the deceased .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 16]: The Members of the House of Representatives , and Senators from Maine , as Mourners .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 8]: The Serjeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 12]: The House of Representatives , preceded by their Speaker and Clerk .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 6]: The Serjeant-at-Arms of the Senate .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 16]: The Senate of the United States , preceded by the Vice President and their Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 7]: The President of the United States .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 5]: The Heads of Departments .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 10]: Judges of the Supreme Court , and its Officers .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 3]: Foreign Ministers .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 4]: Citizens and Strangers .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 8]: _ February _ , 26th , 1838 .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 30]: The burial-ground being at some distance , carriages were provided for the whole of the company , and the procession even then was more than half a mile long .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 52]: I walked there to witness the whole proceeding ; but when the body had been deposited in the vault , I found , on my return , a vacant seat in one of the carriages , in which were two Americans , who went under the head of `` Citizens . ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 9]: They were very much inclined to be communicative .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 73]: One of them observed of the clergyman , who , in his exhortation , had expressed himself very forcibly against the practice of duelling : -- `` Well , I reckon that chaplain wo n't be ` lected next year , and sarve him right too ; he did pitch it in rather too strong for the members ; that last flourish of his was enough to raise all their danders . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 39]: To the other , who was a more staid sort of personage , I put the question , how long did he think this tragical event , and the severe observations on duelling , would stop the practice .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 16]: `` Well , I reckon three days , or thereabouts , '' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 14]: I am afraid that the man is not far out in his calculation .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 2]: Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 45]: Mississippi , Louisiana , and now Congress , as respects the district of Columbia , in which Washington is built , have all passed severe laws against the practice of duelling , which is universal ; but they are no more than dead letters .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 29]: The spirit of their institutions is adverse to such laws ; and duelling always has been , and always will be , one of the evils of democracy .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 41]: I have , I believe , before observed , that in many points a young nation is , in all its faults , very like to a young individual ; and this is one in which the comparison holds good .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 26]: But there are other causes for , and other incentives to this practice , besides the false idea that it is a proof of courage .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 57]: Slander and detraction are the inseparable evils of a democracy ; and as neither public nor private characters are spared , and the law is impotent to protect them , men have no other resource than to defend their reputations with their lives , or to deter the defamer by the risk which he must incur .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 28]: And where political animosities are carried to such a length as they are in this exciting climate , there is no time given for coolness and reflection .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 26]: Indeed , for one American who would attempt to prevent a duel , there are ten who would urge the parties on to the conflict .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 16]: I recollect a gentleman introducing me to the son of another gentleman who was present .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 65]: The lad , who was about fourteen , I should think , shortly after left the room ; and then the gentleman told me , before the boy 's father , that the lad was one of the right sort , having already fought , and wounded his man ; and the father smiled complacently at this tribute to the character of his son .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 35]: The majority of the editors of the newspapers in America are constantly practising with the pistol , that they may be ready when called upon , and are most of them very good shots .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 31]: In fact , they could not well refuse to fight , being all of them colonels , majors , or generals -- '' _ tam Marte quam Mercurio _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 37]: But the worst feature in the American system of duelling is , that they do not go out , as we do in this country , to satisfy honour , but with the determination to kill .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 24]: Independently of general practice , immediately after a challenge has been given and received , each party practises as much as he can .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 18]: And now let us examine into the particulars of this duel between Mr Graves and Mr Cilley .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 17]: It was well known that Mr Graves had hardly ever fired a rifle in his life .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 45]: Mr Cilley , on the contrary , was an excellent rifle-shot , constantly in practice : it was well known , also , that he intended to fix a quarrel upon one of the southern members , as he had publicly said he would .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 35]: He brought his rifle down to Washington with him ; he practised with it almost every day , and more regularly so after he had sent the challenge , and it had been accepted .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 47]: It so happened that , contrary to the expectations of all parties , Mr Cilley , instead of Mr Graves , was the party who fell ; but surely , if ever there was a man who _ premeditated murder _ , it was Mr Cilley .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 56]: I state this , not with the wish to assail Mr Cilley 's character , as I believe that almost any other American would have done the same thing ; for whatever license society will give , that will every man take , and moreover , from habit , will not consider it as wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 142]: But my reason for pointing out all this is to show that society must be in a very loose state , and the standard of morality must be indeed low in a nation , when a man who has fallen in such a manner , a man who , had he killed Mr Graves , would , according to the laws of our country , have been condemned and executed for murder , -LRB- inasmuch as from his practising after the challenge was given , it would have proved _ malice prepense _ , on his part -RRB- should now , because he falls in the attempt , have _ honours paid to his remains _ , much _ greater _ than we paid to those of _ Nelson _ , when he fell so nobly in his country 's cause .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 70]: The chief magistrate of England , which is the king , did not follow Nelson to the grave ; while the chief magistrate of the United States -LRB- attended by the Supreme Court and judges , the Senate , the Representatives -RRB- does honour to the remains of one who , if Providence had not checked him in his career , would have been considered as a cold-blooded murderer .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 21]: And yet the Americans are continually dinning into my ears -- Captain Marryat , we are a very moral people !
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 19]: Again , I repeat , the Americans are the happiest people in the world in their own delusions .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 37]: If they wish to be a moral people , the government must show them some better example than that of paying those honours to vice and immorality which are only due to honour and to virtue .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 6]: _ Legislation on Duelling _ .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 26]: -- The legislature of Mississippi has prohibited duelling , and the parties implicated , in any instance , are declared to be ineligible to office .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 60]: The act also imposes a fine of not less than three hundred dollars , and not more than one thousand , and an imprisonment of not less than six months : and in case of the death of one of the parties , the survivor is to be held chargeable with the payment of the debts of his antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 27]: The estate of the party who falls in the combat is to be exonerated from such debts until the surviving party be first prosecuted to insolvency .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 16]: The seconds are made subject to incapacity to hold office , fine , and imprisonment .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 3]: ANTI-DUELLING BILL .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 45]: The bill , as it passed the senate , is in the following words : -- A Bill to prohibit the giving or accepting , within the District of Columbia , of a Challenge to fight a Duel , and for the punishment thereof .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 229]: Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America , in Congress assembled , That if any person shall , in the district of Columbia , challenge another to fight a duel , or shall send or deliver any written or verbal message purporting or intending to be such challenge , or shall accept any such challenge or message , or shall knowingly carry or deliver any such challenge or message , or shall knowingly carry or deliver an acceptance of such challenge or message to fight a duel in or out of said district , and such duel shall be fought in or out of said district ; and if either of the parties thereto shall be slain or mortally wounded in such duel , the surviving party to such duel , and every person carrying or delivering such challenge or message , or acceptance of such challenge or message as aforesaid , and all others aiding and abetting therein , shall be deemed guilty of felony , and upon conviction thereof ; in any court competent to the trial thereof , in the said district , shall be punished by imprisonment and confinement to hard labour in the penitentiary for a term not exceeding ten years , nor less than five years , in the discretion of the court .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 2]: Sec .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 172]: And be it further enacted , that if any person shall give or send , or cause to be given or sent , to any person in the district of Columbia , any challenge to fight a duel , or to engage in single combat with any deadly or dangerous instrument or weapon whatever , or shall be the bearer of any such challenge , every person so giving or sending , or causing to be given or sent , or accepting such challenge , or being the bearer thereof , and every person aiding or abetting in the giving , sending , or accepting such challenge , shall be deemed guilty of a high crime and misdemeanor , and on conviction thereof in any court competent to try the same , in the said district , shall be punished by imprisonment and confinement to hard labour in the penitentiary , for a term not exceeding ten years , nor less than five years , in the discretion of the court .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 2]: Sec .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 172]: And be it further enacted , that if any person shall assault , strike , beat , or wound , or cause to be assaulted , stricken , beaten , or wounded , any person in the district of Columbia for declining or refusing to accept any challenge to fight a duel , or to engage in single combat with any deadly or dangerous instrument or weapon whatever , or shall , post or publish , or cause to be posted or published , any writing charging any such person so declining or refusing to accept any such challenge to be a coward , or using any other opprobrious or injurious language therein , tending to deride and disgrace such person , for so offending , on conviction thereof in any court competent to trial thereof in said district , shall be punished by confinement to hard labour in the penitentiary for a term not exceeding seven years , nor less than three years , in the discretion of the court .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 2]: Sec .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 2]: 4 .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 54]: And be it further enacted , that in addition to the oath now to be prescribed by law to be administered to the grand jury in the district of Columbia , they shall be sworn faithfully and impartially to inquire into , and true presentment make of , all offences against this act .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 31]: I have been for some time journeying through the province of Upper Canada , and , on the whole , I consider it the finest portion of all North America .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 29]: In America every degree of longitude which you proceed west , is equal to a degree of latitude to the southward in increasing the mildness of the temperature .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 51]: Upper Canada , which is not so far west as to sever you from the civilised world , has every possible advantage of navigation , and is at the same time , from being nearly surrounded by water , much milder than the American States to the southward of it .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 20]: Every thing grows well and flourishes in Upper Canada ; even tobacco , which requires a very warm atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 29]: The land of this province is excellent , but it is a hard land to clear , the timber being very close and of a very large size .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 26]: A certain proof of the value of the land of Upper Canada is , that there are already so many Americans who have settled there .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 71]: Most of them had originally emigrated to establish themselves in the neighbouring state of Michigan ; but the greater part of that state is at present so unhealthy from swamps , and the people suffer so much from fever and agues , that the emigrants have fallen back upon Upper Canada , which -LRB- a very small portion of it excepted -RRB- is the most healthy portion of North America .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 52]: I have before observed , that the Rideau and Welland canals , splendid works as they are , are too much in advance of the country : and had the Government spent one-half the money in opening communications and making good roads , the province would have been much more benefited .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 83]: In the United States you have a singular proof of the advantages of communication ; in the old continent , towns and villages rise up first , and the communications , are made afterwards ; in the United States , the roads are made first , and when made , towns and villages make their appearance on each side of them , just as the birds drop down for their aliment upon the fresh furrows made across the fallow by the plough .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 24]: From Hamilton , on Lake Ontario , to Bradford , the country is very beautifully broken and undulating , occasionally precipitate and hilly .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 19]: You pass through forests of splendid timber , chiefly fir , but of a size which is surprising .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 34]: Here are masts for `` tall admirals , '' so lofty that you could not well perceive a squirrel , or even a large animal , if upon one of the topmast boughs .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 42]: The pine forests are diversified by the oak ; you sometimes pass through six or seven miles of the first description of timber , which gradually changes , until you have six or seven miles of forest composed entirely of oak .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 31]: The road is repairing and levelling , preparatory to its being macadamised -- certainly not before it was required , for it is at present execrable throughout the whole province .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 53]: Every mile or so you descend into a hollow , at the bottom of which is what they term a _ mud hole _ , that is , a certain quantity of water and mud , which is of a depth unknown , but which you must fathom by passing through it .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 56]: To give an Englishman an idea of the roads is not easy ; I can only say that it is very possible for a horse to be drowned in one of the _ ruts _ , and for a pair of them to disappear , waggon and all , in a _ mud hole _ .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 37]: At Bradford , on Grand River , are located some remnants of the Mohawk tribe of Indians ; they are more than demi-civilised ; they till their farms , and have plenty of horses and cattle .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 98]: A smart looking Indian drove into town , when I was there , in a waggon with a pair of good horses ; in the waggon were some daughters of one of their chiefs ; they were very richly dressed after their own fashion , their petticoats and leggings being worked with beads to the height of two feet from the bottom , and in very good taste ; and they wore beaver hats and feathers of a pattern which used formerly to be much in vogue with the ladies of the seamen at Plymouth and Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 48]: From Bradford to London the roads are _ comparatively _ good ; the country rises , and the plain is nearly one hundred feet above the level of the river Thames , a beautifully wide stream , whose two branches join at the site of this town .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 21]: The land here is considered to be the finest in the whole province , and the country the most healthy .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 12]: From London to Chatham the roads are really _ awful _ .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 57]: I had the pleasure of tumbling over head and ears into a mud hole , at about twelve o'clock at night ; the horses were with difficulty saved , and the waggon remained _ fixed _ for upwards of three hours , during which we laboured hard , and were refreshed with plentiful showers of rain .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 30]: Chatham , on the river Thames , is at present a sad dirty hole ; but , as the country rises , will be a place of great importance .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 52]: From Chatham I embarked in the steam-boat , and went down the Thames into Lake St Clair , and from thence to Sandwich , having passed through the finest country , the most beautiful land , and about the most infamous roads that are to be met with in all America .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 23]: Within these last seven or eight years the lakes have risen ; many hypotheses have been offered to account for this change .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 36]: I do not coincide with any of the opinions which I have heard , yet , at the same time , it is but fair to acknowledge that I can offer none of my own .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 6]: It is quite a mystery .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 49]: The consequence of this rising of the waters is , that some of the finest farms at the month of the river Thames and on Lake St Clair , occupied by the old Canadian settlers , are , and have been for two or three years under water .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 42]: These Canadians have not removed ; they are waiting for the water to subside ; their houses stand in the lake , the basements being under water , and they occupy the first floors with their families , communicating by boats .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 13]: As they can not cultivate their land , they shoot and fish .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 60]: Several miles on each side of the mouth of the river Thames the water is studded with these houses , which have , as may be supposed , a very forlorn appearance , especially as the top rail of the fences is generally above water , marking out the fields which are now tenanted by fish instead of cattle .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 23]: Went out with a party into the bush , as it is termed , to see some land which had been purchased .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 19]: Part of the road was up to the saddle-flaps under water , from the rise of the lakes .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 30]: We soon entered the woods , not so thickly growing but that our horses could pass through them , had it not been for the obstacles below our feet .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 50]: At every third step a tree lay across the path , forming , by its obstruction to the drainage , a pool of water ; but the Canadian horses are so accustomed to this that they very coolly walked over them , although some were two feet in diameter .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 29]: They never attempted to jump , but deliberately put one foot over and the other -- with equal dexterity avoiding the stumps and sunken logs concealed under water .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 14]: An English horse would have been foundered before he had proceeded fifty yards .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 33]: Sometimes we would be for miles wading through swamps ; at others the land rose , and then it was clear and dry , and we could gallop under the oak trees .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 30]: We continued till noon before we could arrive at the land in question , forcing our way through the woods , and guided by the blazing of the trees .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 40]: _ Blazing _ is cutting off a portion of the bark of the trees on both sides of the road with an axe , and these marks , which will remain for many years , serve as a guide .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 29]: If lost in the woods you have but to look out for a blaze , and by following it you are certain to arrive at some inhabited place .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 20]: We found the land at last , which was high , dry , and covered with large oak trees .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 39]: A herd of deer bounded past us as we approached the river , which ran through it ; and we could perceive the flocks of wild turkeys at a distance , running almost as fast as the deer .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 66]: The river was choked by trees which had fallen across its bed , damming up its stream , and spreading it over the land ; but the scene was very beautiful and wild , and I could not help fancying what a pretty spot it would one day be , when it should be cleared , and farm-houses built on the banks of the river .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 28]: On our way we called upon a man who had been in the hush but a year or so ; he had a wife and six children .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 45]: He was young and healthy , and although he had been used to a life of _ literary _ idleness , he had made up his mind to the change , and taken up the axe -- a thing very few people can do .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 11]: I never saw a person apparently more cheerful and contented .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 25]: He had already cleared away about fifteen acres , and had procured a summer crop from off a portion of it the year before !
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 26]: having no other assistance than his two boys , one thirteen and the other fourteen years old , healthy , but not powerfully built lads .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 20]: When we called upon him , he was busied in burning the felled timber , and planting Indian corn .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 9]: One of his boys was fencing-in the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 73]: I went with the man into his log-hut , which was large and convenient , and found his wife working at her needle , and three little girls all as busy as bees ; the eldest of these girls was not twelve years old , yet she cooked , baked , washed , and , with the assistance of her two little sisters , did all that was required for the household .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 28]: After a short repose , we went out again into the clearing , when one of my friends asked him how he got on with his axe ?
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 17]: `` Pretty well , '' replied he , laughing ; `` I 'll show you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 41]: He led us to where a button-wood tree was lying ; the trunk was at least ninety feet long , and the diameter where it had been cut through between five and six feet ; it was an enormous tree .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 10]: `` And did you cut that down yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 10]: enquired my companion , who was an old settler .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 27]: `` Not quite ; but I cut through the north half while my two boys cut through the south ; we did it between us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 29]: This was really astonishing , for if these two lads could cut through half the tree , it is evident that they could have cut it down altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 17]: We had here a proof of how useful children can be made at an early age .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 14]: We promised to call upon him on our return ; which we did .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 41]: We found him sitting with his wife in his log-house ; it was five o'clock in the afternoon ; he told us `` work was over now , and that the children had gone into the bush to play . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 18]: They had all worked from five o'clock in the morning , and had since learnt their lessons .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 12]: We heard their laughter ringing in the woods at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 16]: Now this is rather a remarkable instance among settlers , as I shall hereafter explain .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 36]: Had this man been a bachelor , he would have been , in all probability , a drunkard ; but , with his family , he was a happy , contented , and thriving man .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 29]: We parted with him , and arrived at Windsor , opposite Detroit , very tired , having been , with little exception , fourteen hours in the saddle .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 12]: I took cold , and was laid up with a fever .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 28]: I mention this , not as any thing interesting to the reader , but merely to show what you may expect when you travel in these countries .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 16]: I had been in bed three days , when my landlady came into the room .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 15]: `` Well , captain , how do you find yourself by this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 56]: `` Oh , I am a little better , thank you , '' replied I. `` Well , I am glad of it , because I want to whitewash your room ; for if the coloured man stops to do it to-morrow , he 'll be for charging us another quarter of a dollar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 12]: `` But I am not able to leave my room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 27]: `` Well , then , I 'll speak to him ; I dare say he wo n't mind your being in bed while he whitewashes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 22]: I have often remarked the strange effects of intoxication , and the different manner in which persons are affected with liquor .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 28]: When I was on the road from London to Chatham , a man who was very much intoxicated got into the waggon , and sat beside me .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 49]: As people in that state generally are , he was excessively familiar ; and although jerked off with no small degree of violence , would continue , until we arrived at the inn where we were to sup , to attempt to lay his head upon my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 10]: As soon as we arrived , supper was announced .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 50]: At first he refused to take any , but on the artful landlady bawling in his ear , that all _ gentlemen _ supped when they arrived , he hesitated to consider -LRB- which certainly was not at all necessary -RRB- whether he was not bound to take some .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 49]: Another very important remark of the hostess , which was , that he would have nothing to eat until the next morning , it being then eleven o'clock at night , decided him , and he staggered in , observing , `` Nothing to eat till next morning !
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 9]: well , I never thought of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 12]: He sat down opposite to me , at the same table .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 48]: It appeared as if his _ vision was inverted _ by the quantity of liquor which he had taken ; everything close to him on the table he considered to be out of his reach , whilst everything at a distance he attempted to lay hold of .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 43]: He sat up as erect as he could , balancing himself so as not to appear _ canned _ , and fixing his eyes upon me , said , `` Sir , I 'll trouble you -- for some fried ham . ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 23]: Now the ham was in the dish next to him , and altogether out of my reach ; I told him so .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 26]: `` Sir , '' said he again , `` as a gentleman , I ask you to give me some of that fried ham . ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 20]: Amused with the curious demand , I rose from my chair , went round to him and helped him .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 30]: `` Shall I give you a potato , '' said I , the potatoes being at my end of the table , and I not wishing to rise again .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 18]: `` No , Sir , '' replied he , `` I can help myself to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 47]: He made a dash at them , but did not reach them ; then made another , and another , till he lost his balance , and lay down upon his plate ; this time he gained the potatoes , helped himself , and commenced eating .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 12]: After a few minutes he again fixed his eyes upon me .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 13]: `` Sir , I 'll trouble you -- for the pickles . ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 15]: They were actually under his nose , and I pointed them out to him .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 21]: `` I believe , Sir , I asked you for the pickles , '' repeated he , after a time .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 19]: `` Well , there they are , '' replied I , wishing to see what he would do .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 26]: `` Sir , are you a gentleman -- as a gentleman -- I ask you as a gentleman , for them ` ere pickles . ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 15]: It was impossible to resist this appeal , so I rose and helped him .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 38]: I was now convinced that his vision was somehow or another inverted , and to prove it , when he asked me for the salt , which was within his reach , I removed it farther off .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 17]: `` Thank ye , Sir , '' said he , sprawling over the table after it .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 19]: The circumstance , absurd as it was , was really a subject for the investigation of Dr Brewster .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 39]: At Windsor , which is directly opposite to Detroit , where the river is about half a mile across , are stores of English goods , sent there entirely for the supply of the Americans , by smugglers .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 32]: There is also a row of tailor shops , for cloth is a very dear article in America , and costs nearly double the price it does in the English provinces .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 36]: The Americans go over there , and are measured for a suit of clothes which , when ready , they put on , and cross back to Detroit with their old clothes in a bundle .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 22]: The smuggling is already very extensive , and will , of course , increase as the Western country becomes more populous .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 27]: Near Windsor and Sandwich are several villages of free blacks , probably the major portion of them having been assisted in their escape by the Abolitionists .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 32]: They are not very good neighbours from their propensity to thieving , which either is innate , or , as Miss Martineau would have it , is the effect of slavery .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 40]: I shall not dispute that point ; but it is certain that they are most inveterately hostile to the Americans , and will fight to the last , from the dread of being again subjected to their former masters .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 29]: They are an excellent frontier population ; and in the last troubles they proved how valuable they would become , in case their services were more seriously required .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 27]: Once more on board of the Michigan , one of the best vessels on Lake Erie ; as usual , full of emigrants , chiefly Irish .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 38]: It is impossible not to feel compassion for these poor people , wearied as they are with confinement and suffering , and yet they do compose occasionally about as laughable a group as can well be conceived .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 24]: In the first place , they bring out with them from Ireland , articles which no other people would consider worth the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 32]: I saw one Irish woman who had old tin tea pots ; there was but one spout among the whole , and I believe not one bottom really sound and good .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 28]: And then their costumes , more particularly the fitting out of the children , who are not troubled with any extra supply of clothes at any time !
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 24]: I have witnessed the seat of an old pair of corduroy trowsers transformed into a sort of bonnet for a laughing fair-haired girl .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 94]: But what amused me more was the very reverse of this arrangement ; a boy 's father had just put a patch upon the hinder part of his son 's trousers ; and cloth not being at hand , he had , as an expedient for stopping the gap , inserted a piece of an old straw bonnet ; in so doing he had not taken the precaution to put the smooth side of the plait inwards , and , in consequence , young Teddy when he first sat down felt rather uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 19]: `` What 's the matter wid ye , Teddy ; what makes ye wriggle about in that way ?
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 37]: Sit aisy , man ; sure enough , hav n't ye a strait-bottomed chair to sit down upon all the rest of your journey , which is more than your father ever had before you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 9]: And then their turning in for the night !
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 25]: A single bed will contain one adult and four little ones at one end , and another adult and two half-grown at the other .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 26]: But they are all packed away so snug and close , and not one venturing to move , there appears to be room for all .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 24]: We stopped half an hour at Mackinaw to take in wood , and then started for Green Bay , in the Wisconsin territory .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 22]: Green Bay is a military station ; it is a pretty little place , with soil as rich as garden mould .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 75]: The Fox river debouches here , but the navigation is checked a few miles above the town by the rapids , which have been dammed up into a water power ; yet there is no doubt that as soon as the whole of the Wisconsin lands are offered for sale by the American Government , the river will be made navigable up to its meeting with the Wisconsin , which falls into the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 38]: There is only a portage of a mile and a half between the two , through which a canal will be cut , and then there will be another junction between the lakes and the Far West .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 60]: It was my original intention to have taken the usual route by Chicago and Galena to St Louis , but I fell in with Major F -- , with whom I had been previously acquainted , who informed me that he was about to send a detachment of troops from Green Bay to Fort Winnebago , across Wisconsin territory .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 26]: As this afforded me an opportunity of seeing the country , which seldom occurs , I availed myself of an offer to join the party .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 45]: The detachment consisted of about one hundred recruits , nearly the whole of them Canada patriots , as they are usually called , who , having failed in taking the provinces from John Bull , were fain to accept the shilling from uncle Sam .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 56]: Major F -- accompanied us to pay the troops at the fort , and we therefore had five waggons with us , loaded with a considerable quantity of bread and pork , and not quite so large a proportion of specie , the latter not having as yet become plentiful again in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 32]: We set off , and marched fifteen miles in about half a day , passing through the settlement Des Peres , which is situated at the rapids of the Fox river .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 22]: Formerly they were called the Rapids des Peres , from a Jesuit college which had been established there by the French .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 27]: Our course lay along the banks of the Fox river , a beautiful swift stream pouring down between high ridges , covered with fine oak timber .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 106]: The American Government have disposed of all the land on the banks of this river and the Lake Winnebago , and consequently it is well settled ; but the Winnebago territory in Wisconsin , lately purchased of the Winnebago Indians , and comprising all the prairie land and rich mineral country from Galena to Mineral Point , is not yet offered for sale : when it is , it will be eagerly purchased ; and the American Government , as it only paid the Indians at the rate of one cent and a fraction per acre , will make an enormous profit by the speculation .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 66]: Well may the Indians be said , like Esau , to part with their birthright for a mess of pottage ; but , in truth , they are _ compelled _ to sell -- the purchase-money being a mere subterfuge , by which it may _ appear _ as if their lands were not wrested from them , although , in fact , it is .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 73]: On the second day we continued our march along the banks of the Fox river , which , as we advanced , continued to be well settled , and would have been more so , if some of the best land had not fallen , as usual , into the hands of speculators , who , aware of its value , hold out that they may obtain a high price for it .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 44]: The country through which we passed was undulating , consisting of a succession of ridges , covered with oaks of a large size , but not growing close as in a forest ; you could gallop your horse through any part of it .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 23]: The tracks of deer were frequent , but we saw but one herd of fifteen , and that was at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 42]: We now left the banks of the river , and cut across the country to Fond du Lac , at the bottom of Lake Winnebago , of which we had had already an occasional glimpse through the openings of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 30]: The deer were too wild to allow of our getting near them ; so I was obliged to content myself with shooting wood pigeons , which were very plentiful .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 22]: On the night of the third day we encamped upon a very high ridge ; as usual studded with oak trees .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 21]: The term used here to distinguish this variety of timber land from the impervious woods is _ oak openings _ .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 17]: I never saw a more beautiful view than that which was afforded us from our encampment .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 45]: From the high ground upon which our tents were pitched , we looked down to the left , upon a prairie flat and level as a billiard-table , extending , as far as the eye could scan , one rich surface of unrivalled green .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 31]: To the right the prairie gradually changed to oak openings , and then to a thick forest , the topmost boughs and heads of which were level with our tents .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 75]: Beyond them was the whole broad expanse of the Winnebago lake , smooth and reflecting like a mirror the brilliant tints of the setting sun , which disappeared , leaving a portion of his glory behind him ; while the moon in her ascent , with the dark portion of her disk as clearly defined as that which was lighted , gradually increased in brilliancy , and the stars twinkled in the clear sky .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 28]: We watched the features of the landscape gradually fading from our sight , until nothing was left but broad masses partially lighted up by the young moon .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 37]: Nor was the foreground less picturesque : the spreading oaks , the tents of the soldiers , the waggons drawn up with the horses tethered , all lighted up by the blaze of our large fires .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 66]: Now , when I say our large fires , I mean the _ large _ fires of _ America _ , consisting of three or four oak trees , containing a load of wood each , besides many large boughs and branches , altogether forming a fire some twenty or thirty feet long , with flames flickering up twice as high as one 's head .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 35]: At a certain distance from this blazing pile you may perceive what in another situation would be considered as a large coffee-pot -LRB- before this huge fire it makes a very diminutive appearance -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 82]: It is placed over some embers drawn out from the mass , which would have soon burnt up coffee-pot and coffee all together ; and at a still more respectful distance you may perceive small rods , not above four or five feet long , bifurcated at the smaller end , and fixed by the larger in the ground , so as to hang towards the huge fire , at an angle of forty degrees , like so many tiny fishing-rods .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 46]: These rods have at their bifurcated ends a piece of pork or ham , or of bread , or perhaps of venison , for we bought some , not having shot any : they are all private property , as each party cooks for himself .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 27]: Seeing these rods at some distance , you might almost imagine that they were the fishing-rods of little imps bobbing for salamanders in the fiery furnace .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 40]: In the mean time , while the meat is cooking and the coffee is boiling , the brandy and whisky are severely taxed , as we lie upon our cloaks and buffalo skins at the front of our tents .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 49]: There certainly is a charm in this wild sort of life , which wins upon people the more they practise it ; nor can it be wondered at : our wants are in reality so few and so easily satisfied , without the restraint of form and ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 24]: How often , in my wanderings , have I felt the truth of Shakespeare 's lines in `` As You Like It . ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 25]: `` Now , my co-mates and partners in exile , Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp ?
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 13]: Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court ?
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 15]: Here feel we but the penalty of Adam -- The seasons ' difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 37]: On the fourth day we descended , crossed the wide prairie , and arrived at the Fond du Lac , where we again fell in with the Fox river , which runs through the Winnebago lake .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 52]: The roads through the forests had been very bad , and the men and horses showed signs of fatigue ; but we had now passed through all the thickly wooded country , and had entered into the prairie country , extending to Fort Winnebago , and which was beautiful beyond concoction .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 18]: Its features alone can be described ; but its effects can only be felt by being seen .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 43]: The prairies here are not very large , seldom being above six or seven miles in length or breadth ; generally speaking , they lie in gentle undulating flats , and the ridges and hills between them are composed of oak openings .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 59]: To form an idea of these oak openings , imagine an inland country covered with splendid trees , about as thickly planted as in our English parks ; in fact , it is English park scenery , Nature having here spontaneously produced what it has been the care and labour of centuries in our own country to effect .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 32]: Sometimes the prairie will rise and extend along the hills , and assume an undulating appearance , like the long swell of the ocean ; it is then called rolling prairie .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 86]: Often , when I looked down upon some fifteen or twenty thousand acres of these prairies , full of rich grass , without one animal , tame or wild , to be seen , I would fancy what thousands of cattle will , in a few years , be luxuriating in those pastures , which , since the herds of buffalo have retreated from them , are now useless , and throwing up each year a fresh crop , to seed and to die unheeded .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 41]: On our way we had fallen in with a young Frenchman , who had purchased some land at Fond du Lac , and was proceeding there in company with an American , whom he had hired to settle on it .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 77]: I now parted company with him ; he had gone out with me in my shooting excursions , and talked of nothing but his purchase : it had water ; it had a waterfall ; it had , in fact , everything that he could desire ; but he thought that , after two years , he would go home and get a wife : a Paradise without an Eve would be no Paradise at all .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 20]: The price of labour is , as may be supposed , very high in this part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 32]: Hiring by the year , you find a man in food , board , and washing , and pay him three hundred dollars per annum -LRB- about 70 pounds English . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 13]: The last night that we bivouacked out was the only unfortunate one .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 52]: We had been all comfortably settled for the night , and fast asleep , when a sudden storm came on , accompanied with such torrents of rain as would have washed us out of our tents , if they had not been already blown down by the violence of the gale .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 74]: Had we had any warning , we should have provided against it ; as it was , we made up huge fires , which defied the rain ; and thus we remained till day-light , the rain pouring on us , while the heat of the fire drying us almost as fast as we got wet , each man threw up a column of steam from his still saturating and still heated garments .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 66]: Every night we encamped where there was a run of water , and plenty of dead timber for our fires ; and thus did we go on , emptying our waggons daily of the bread and pork , and filling up the vacancies left by the removal of the empty casks with the sick and lame , until at last we arrived at Fort Winnebago .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 52]: We had not to arrive at the fort to receive a welcome , for when we were still distant about seven miles , the officers of the garrison , who had notice of our coming , made their appearance on horseback , bringing a britchska and grey horses for our accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 43]: Those who were not on duty -LRB- and I was one -RRB- accepted the invitation , and we drove in upon a road which , indeed , for the last thirty miles , had been as level as the best in England .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 39]: The carriage was followed by pointers , hounds , and a variety of dogs , who were off duty like ourselves , and who appeared quite as much delighted with their run as we were tired with ours .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 38]: The medical officer attached to the fort , an old friend and correspondent of Mr Lee of Philadelphia , received me with all kindness , and immediately installed me into one of the rooms in the hospital .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 60]: Fort Winnebago is situated between the Fox and Wisconsin rivers at the portage , the two rivers being about a mile and a-half apart ; the Fox river running east , and giving its waters to Lake Michigan at Green Bay , while the Wisconsin turns to the west , and runs into the Mississippi at Prairie du Chien .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 32]: The fort is merely a square of barracks , connected together with palisades , to protect it from the Indians ; and it is hardly sufficiently strong for even that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 18]: It is beautifully situated , and when the country fills up will become a place of importance .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 21]: Most of the officers are unmarried , and live a very quiet , and secluded , but not unpleasant life .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 64]: I stayed there two days , much pleased with the society and the kindness shown to me ; but an opportunity of descending the Wisconsin to Prairie du Chien , in a keel-boat , having presented itself , I availed myself of an invitation to join the party , instead of proceeding by land to Galena , as had been my original intention .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 58]: The boat had been towed up the Wisconsin with a cargo of flour for the garrison ; and a portion of the officers having been ordered down to Prairie du Chien , they had obtained this large boat to transport themselves , families , furniture , and horses , all at once , down to their destination .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 44]: The boat was about one hundred and twenty feet long , covered in to the height of six feet above the gunnel , and very much in appearance like the Noah 's Ark given to children , excepting that the roof was flat .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 56]: It was an unwieldy craft , and , to manage it , it required at least twenty-five men with poles and long sweeps ; but the army gentlemen had decided that , as we were to go down with the stream , six men with short oars would be sufficient -- a very great mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 32]: In every other respect she was badly found , as we term it at sea , having but one old piece of rope to hang on with , and one axe .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 16]: Our freight consisted of furniture stowed forward and aft , with a horse and cow .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 20]: In a cabin in the centre we had a lady and five children , one maid and two officers .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 25]: Our crew was composed of six soldiers , a servant , and a French _ half bred _ to pilot us down the river .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 36]: All Winnebago came out to see us start ; and as soon as the rope was cast off , away we went down with the strong current at the rate of five miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 76]: The river passed through forests of oak , the large limbs of which hung from fifteen to twenty feet over the banks on each side ; sometimes whole trees lay prostrate in the stream , held by their roots still partially remaining in the ground , while their trunks and branches offering resistance to the swift current , created a succession of small masses of froth , which floated away on the dark green water .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 112]: We had not proceeded far , before we found that it was impossible to manage such a large and cumbrous vessel with our few hands ; we were almost at the mercy of the current , which appeared to increase in rapidity every minute ; however , by exertion and good management , we contrived to keep in the middle of the stream until the wind sprung up and drove us on to the southern bank of the river , and then all was cracking and tearing away of the wood-work , breaking of limbs from the projecting trees , the snapping , cracking , screaming , hallooing , and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 34]: As fast as we cleared ourselves of one tree , the current bore us down upon another ; as soon as we were clear above water , we were foul and entangled below .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 41]: It was a pretty general average ; but , what was worse than all a snag had intercepted and unshipped our rudder , and we were floating away from it , as it still remained fixed upon the sunken tree .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 49]: We had no boat with us , not oven a _ dug-out _ -- -LRB- a canoe made out of the trunk of a tree -RRB- -- so one of the men climbed on shore by the limbs of an oak , and went back to disengage it .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 41]: He did so , but not being able to resist the force of the stream , down he and the rudder came together -- his only chance of salvation being that of our catching him as he came past us .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 52]: This we fortunately succeeded in effecting ; and then hanging on by our old piece of rope to the banks of the river , after an hour 's delay we contrived to re-ship our rudder , and proceeded on our voyage , which was a continuation of the same eventful history .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 63]: Every half hour we found ourselves wedged in between the spreading limbs of the oaks , and were obliged to have recourse to the axe to clear ourselves : and on every occasion we lost a further portion of the frame-work of our boat , either from the roof , the sides , or by the tearing away of the stancheons themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 25]: A little before sunset , we were again swept on to the bank with such force as to draw the pintles of our rudder .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 60]: This finished us for the day : before it could be replaced , it was time to make fast for the night ; so there we lay , holding by our rotten piece of rope , which cracked and strained to such a degree , as inclined us to speculate upon where we might find ourselves in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 42]: However , we could not help ourselves , so we landed , made a large fire , and cooked our victuals ; not , however , venturing to wander away far , on account of the rattle-snakes , which here abounded .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 21]: Perhaps there is no portion of America in which the rattle-snakes are so large and so numerous as in Wisconsin .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 41]: There are two varieties : the black rattle-snake , that frequents marshy spots , and renders it rather dangerous to shoot snipes and ducks ; and the yellow , which takes up its abode in the rocks and dry places .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 29]: Dr F -- told me that he had killed , inside of the fort Winnebago , one of the latter species , between seven and eight feet long .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 27]: The rattle-snake , although its poison is so fatal , is in fact not a very dangerous animal , and people are seldom bitten by it .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 47]: This arises from two causes : first , that it invariably gives you notice of its presence by its rattle ; and secondly , that it always coils itself up like a watch-spring before it strikes , and then darts forward only about its own length .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 31]: Where they are common , the people generally carry with them a vial of ammonia , which , if instantly applied to the bite , will at least prevent death .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 25]: The copper-head is a snake of a much more dangerous nature , from its giving no warning , and its poison being equally active .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 42]: This river has been very appropriately named by the Indians the ` Stream of the Thousand Isles , ' as it is studded with them ; indeed , every quarter of a mile you find one or two in its channel .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 72]: The scenery is fine , as the river runs through high ridges , covered with oak to their summits ; sometimes these ridges are backed by higher cliffs and mountains , which halfway up are of a verdant green , and above that present horizontal strata of calcareous rock of rich grey tints , having , at a distance , very much the appearance of the dilapidated castles on the Rhine .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 20]: The scenery , though not so grand as the highlands of the Hudson , is more diversified and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 26]: The river was very full , and the current occasionally so rapid , as to leave a foam as it swept by any projecting point .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 25]: We had , now that the river widened , sand banks to contend with , which required all the exertions of our insufficient crew .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 46]: On the second morning , I was very much annoyed at our having left without providing ourselves with a boat , for at the grey of dawn , we discovered that some deer had taken the river close to us , and were in midstream .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 16]: Had we had a boat , we might have procured a good supply of venison .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 27]: We cast off again and resumed our voyage ; and without any serious accident we arrived at the shot-tower , where we remained for the night .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 41]: Finding a shot-tower in such a lone wilderness as this , gives you some idea of the enterprise of the Americans ; but the Galena , or lead district , commences here , on the south bank of the Wisconsin .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 51]: The smelting is carried on about twelve miles inland , and the lead is brought here , made into shot , and then sent down the river to the Mississippi , by which , and its tributary streams , it is supplied to all America , west of the Alleghanies .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 10]: The people were all at work when we arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 17]: The general distress had even affected the demand for shot , which was now considerably reduced .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 25]: On the third day we had the good fortune to have no wind , and consequently made rapid progress , without much further damage .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 23]: We passed a small settlement called the English prairie -- for the prairies were now occasionally mixed up with the mountain scenery .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 10]: Here there was a smelting-house and a steam saw-mill .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 36]: The _ diggings _ , as they term the places where the lead is found -LRB- for they do not mine , but dig down from the surface , -RRB- were about sixteen miles distant .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 48]: We continued our course for about twenty miles lower down , when we wound up our day 's work by getting into a more serious _ fix _ among the trees , and eventually losing our only _ axe _ , which fell overboard into deep water .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 26]: All Noah 's Ark was in dismay , for we did not know what might happen , or what the next day might bring forth .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 12]: Fortunately , it was not necessary to cut wood for firing .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 108]: During the whole of this trip I was much amused with our pilot , who , fully aware of the dangers of the river , was also equally conscious that there were not sufficient means on board to avoid them ; when , therefore , we were set upon a sand-bank , or pressed by the wind on the sunken trees , he always whistled ; that was all he could do , and in proportion as the danger became more imminent , so did he whistle the louder , until the affair was decided by a bump or a crash , and then he was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 10]: On the ensuing day we had nothing but misfortunes .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 29]: We were continually twisted and twirled about , sometimes with our bows , sometimes with our stern foremost , and as often with our broadside to the stream .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 24]: We were whirled against one bank , and , as soon as we were clear of that we were thrown upon the other .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 15]: Having no axe to cut away , we were obliged to use our hands .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 12]: Again our rudder was unshipped , and with great difficulty replaced .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 39]: By this time we had lost nearly the half of the upper works of the boat , one portion after another having been torn off by the limbs of the trees as the impetuous current drove us along .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 21]: To add to our difficulties , a strong wind rose against the current , and the boat became quite unmanageable .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 98]: About noon , when we had gained only seven miles , the wind abated , and two Menonnomie Indians , in a _ dug-out _ , came alongside of us ; and as it was doubtful whether we should arrive at the mouth of the river on that night , or be left upon a sand-bank , I got into the canoe with them , to go down to the landing-place , and from thence to cross over to Prairie du Chien , to inform the officers of the garrison of our condition , and obtain assistance .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 30]: The canoe would exactly hold three , and no more ; but we paddled swiftly down the stream , and we soon lost sight of the Noah 's Ark. .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 59]: Independently of the canoe being so small , she had lost a large portion of her stem , so that at the least ripple of the water she took it in , and threatened us with a swim ; and she was so very narrow , that the least motion would have destroyed her equilibrium and upset her .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 22]: One Indian sat in the bow , the other in the stern , whilst I was doubled up in the middle .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 23]: We had given the Indians some bread and pork , and after paddling about half an hour , they stopped to eat .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 106]: Now , the Indian at the bow had the pork , while the one at the stern had the bread ; any attempt to move , so as to hand the eatables to each other , must have upset us ; so this was their plan of communication : -- The one in the bow cut off a slice of pork , and putting it into the lid of a saucepan which he had with him , and floating it alongside of the canoe , gave it a sufficient momentum to make it swim to the stern , when the other took possession of it .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 23]: He in the stern then cut off a piece of bread , and sent it back in return by the same conveyance .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 69]: I had a flask of whisky , but they would not trust that by the same perilous little conveyance ; so I had to lean forward very steadily , and hand it to the foremost , and , when he returned it to me , to lean backwards to give it the other , with whom it remained till we landed , for I could not regain it .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 15]: After about an hour 's more paddling , we arrived safely at the landing-place .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 24]: I had some trouble to get a horse , and was obliged to go out to the fields where the men were ploughing .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 13]: In doing so , I passed two or three very large snakes .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 19]: At last I was mounted somehow , but without stirrups , and set off for Prairie du Chien .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 51]: After riding about four miles , I had passed the mountain , and I suddenly came upon the prairie -LRB- on which were feeding several herd of cattle and horses -RRB- , with the fort in the distance , and the wide waters of the Upper Mississippi flowing beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 23]: I crossed the prairie , found my way into the fort , stated the situation of our party , and requested assistance .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 27]: This was immediately dispatched , but on their arrival at the landing-place , they found that the keel-boat had arrived at the ferry without further difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 43]: Before sunset the carriages returned with the whole party , who were comfortably accommodated in the barracks -- a sufficient number of men being left with the boat to bring it round to the Mississippi , a distance of about twelve miles .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 54]: Prairie du Chiens is a beautiful meadow , about eight miles long by two broad , situated at the confluence of the Wisconsin and the Mississippi ; it is backed with high bluffs , such as I have before described , verdant two-thirds of the way up , and crowned with rocky summits .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 78]: The bluffs , as I must call them , for I know not what other name to give them , rise very abruptly , often in a sugar-loaf form , from the flat lands , and have a very striking appearance ; as you look up to them , their peculiar formation and vivid green sides , contrasting with their blue and grey summits , give them the appearance of a succession of ramparts investing the prairie .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 73]: The fort at the prairie , which is named Fort Crawford , is , like most other American outposts , a mere inclosure , intended to repel the attacks of Indians ; but it is large and commodious , and the quarters of the officers are excellent ; it is , moreover , built of stone , which is not the case with Fort Winnebago , or Fort Howard at Green Bay .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 35]: The Upper Mississippi is here a beautiful clear blue stream , intersected with verdant islands , and very different in appearance from the Lower Mississippi , after it has been joined by the Missouri .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 43]: The opposite shore is composed of high cliffs , covered with timber , which , not only in form , but in tint and colour , remind you very much of Glover 's landscapes of the mountainous parts of Scotland and Wales .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 45]: I made one or two excursions to examine the ancient mounds which are scattered all over this district , and which have excited much speculation as to their origin ; some supposing them to have been fortifications , others the burial-places of the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 28]: That they have lately been used by the Indians as burial-places there is no doubt ; but I suspect they were not originally raised for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 68]: A Mr Taylor has written an article in one of the periodicals , stating his opinion that they were the burial-places of chiefs ; and to prove it , he asserts that some of them are thrown up in imitation of the figure of the animal which was the heraldic distinction of the chief whose remains they contain , such as the beaver , elk , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 9]: He has given drawings of some of them .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 74]: That the Indians have their heraldic distinctions , their _ totems _ , as they call them , I know to be a fact ; as I have seen the fur trader 's books , containing the receipts of the chiefs , with their crests drawn by themselves , and very correctly too ; but it required more imagination than I possess to make out the form of any animal in the mounds .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 42]: I should rather suppose the mounds to be the remains of tenements , sometimes fortified , sometimes not , which were formerly built of mud or earth , as is still the custom in the northern portion of the Sioux country .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 33]: Desertion and time have crumbled them into these mounds , which are generally to be found in a commanding situation , or in a string , as if constructed for mutual defence .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 54]: On Rock River there is a long line of wall , now below the surface , which extends for a considerable distance , and is supposed to be the remains of a city built by a former race , probably the Mexican , who long since retreated before the northern race of Indians .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 13]: I can not recollect the name which has been given to it .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 27]: I had not time to visit this spot ; but an officer showed me some pieces of what they called the brick which composes the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 56]: Brick it is not -- no right angles have been discovered , so far as I could learn ; it appears rather as if a wall had been raised of clay , and then exposed to the action of fire , as portions of it are strongly vitrified , and others are merely hard clay .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 55]: But admitting my surmises to be correct , still there is evident proof that this country was formerly peopled by a nation whose habits were very different , and in all appearance more civilised , than those of the races which were found here : and this is all that can be satisfactorily sustained .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 55]: As , however , it is well substantiated that a race similar to the Mexican formerly existed on these prairie lands , the whole question may perhaps be solved by the following extract from Irving 's Conquest of Florida : -- `` The village of Onachili resembles most of the Indian villages of Florida .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 27]: The natives always endeavoured to build upon high ground , not least to erect the house of their cacique , or chief , upon an eminence .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 41]: As the country was very level and high places seldom to be found , they constructed artificial mounds of earth , capable of containing from ten to twenty houses ; there resided the chief , his family , and attendants .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 32]: At the foot of the hill was a square , according to the size of the village , round which were the houses of the leaders and most distinguished inhabitants . ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 23]: I consider the Wisconsin territory as the finest portion of North America , not only from its soil , but its climate .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 32]: The air is pure , and the winters , although severe , are dry and bracing ; very different from , and more healthy than , those of the Eastern States .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 25]: At Prairie du Chien every one dwelt upon the beauty of the winter , indeed they appeared to prefer it to the other seasons .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 47]: The country is , as I have described it in my route from Green Bay , alternate prairie , oak openings , and forest ; and the same may be said of the other side of the Mississippi , now distinguished as the district of Ioway .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 46]: Limestone quarries abound ; indeed , the whole of this beautiful and fertile region appears as if nature had so arranged it that man should have all difficulties cleared from before him , and have but little to do but to take possession and enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 28]: There is no clearing of timber requisite ; on the contrary , you have just as much as you can desire , whether for use or ornament .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 22]: Prairies of fine rich grass , upon which cattle fatten in three or four months , lay spread in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 51]: The soil is so fertile that you have but to turn it up to make it yield grain to any extent ; and the climate is healthy , at the same time that there is more than sufficient sun in the summer and autumn to bring every crop to perfection .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 23]: Land carriage is hardly required from the numerous rivers and streams which pour their waters from every direction into the Upper Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 54]: Add to all this , that the Western lands possess an inexhaustible supply of minerals , only a few feet under the surface of their rich soil -- a singular and wonderful provision , as , in general , where minerals are found below , the soil above is usually arid and ungrateful .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 64]: The mineral country is to the south of the Wisconsin river -- at least nothing has at present been discovered north of it ; but the northern part is still in the possession of the Winnebago Indians , who are waiting for the fulfilment of the treaty before they surrender it , and at present will permit no white settler to enter it .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 62]: It is said that the other portions of the Wisconsin territory will come into the market this year ; at present , with the exception of the Fox river and Winnebago Lake settlements , and that of Prairie du Chien , at the confluence of the two rivers Wisconsin and Mississippi , there is hardly a log-house in the whole district .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 86]: The greatest annoyance at present in this western country is the quantity and variety of snakes ; it is hardly safe to land upon some parts of the Wisconsin river banks , and they certainly offer a great impediment to the excursions of geologist and botanist ; you are obliged to look right and left as you walk , and as for putting your hand into a hole , you would be almost certain to receive a very unwished-for and unpleasant shake to welcome you .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 83]: I ought here to explain an American law relative to what is termed squatting , that is , taking possession of land belonging to government and cultivating it : such was the custom of the back-woodsmen , and , for want of this law , it often happened that after they had cultivated a farm , the land would be applied for and purchased by some speculator , who would forcibly eject the occupant , and take possession of the improved property .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 31]: A back-woodsman was not to be trifled with , and the consequences very commonly were that the new proprietor was found some fine morning with a rifle-bullet through his head .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 71]: To prevent this unjust spoliation on the one part , and summary revenge on the other , a law has been passed , by which any person having taken possession of land belonging to the States Government shall , as soon as the lands have been surveyed and come into the market , have the right of purchasing the quarter section , or one hundred and sixty acres round him .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 31]: Many thousands are settled in this way all over the new Western States , and this pre-emption right is one of the few laws in Western America strictly adhered to .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 12]: A singular proof of this occurred the other day at Galena .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 45]: The government had made regulations with the diggers and smelters on the government lands for a percentage on the lead raised , as a government tax ; and they erected a large stone building to warehouse their portion , which was paid in lead .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 45]: As soon as the government had finished it , a man stepped forward and proved his right of pre-emption on the land upon which the building was erected , and it was decided against the government , although the land was actually government land !
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 59]: -LRB- This chapter incomplete at end -RRB- I remained a week at Prairie du Chien , and left my kind entertainers with regret ; but an opportunity offering of going up to St Peters in a steam-boat , with General Atkinson , who was on a tour of inspection , I could not neglect so favourable a chance .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 63]: St Peters is situated at the confluence of the St Peters River with the Upper Mississippi , about seven miles below the Falls of St Anthony , where the River Mississippi becomes no longer navigable ; and here , removed many hundred miles from civilisation , the Americans have an outpost called fort Snelling , and the American Fur Company an establishment .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 50]: The country to the north is occupied by the Chippeway tribe of Indians ; that to the east by the Winnebagos , and that to the west by the powerful tribe of Sioux or Dacotahs , who range over the whole prairie territory between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 70]: The river here is so constantly divided by numerous islands , that its great width is not discernible : it seldom has less than two or three channels , often more : it courses through a succession of bold bluffs , rising sometimes perpendicularly , and always abruptly from the banks or flat land , occasionally diversified by the prairies , which descend to the edge of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 35]: These bluffs are similar to those I have described in the Wisconsin river and Prairie do Chien , but are on a grander scale , and are surmounted by horizontal layers of limestone rock .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 54]: The islands are all covered with small timber and brushwood , and in the spring , before the leaves have burst out , and the freshets come down , the river rises so as to cover the whole of them , and then you behold the width and magnificence of this vast stream .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 31]: On the second day we arrived at Lake Pepin , which is little more than an expansion of the river , or rather a portion of it , without islands .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 32]: On the third , we made fast to the wharf , abreast of the American Fur Company 's Factory , a short distance below the mouth of the River St Peters .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 52]: Fort Snelling is about a mile from the factory , and is situated on a steep promontory , in a commanding position ; it is built of stone , and may be considered as impregnable to any attempt which the Indians might make , provided that it has a sufficient garrison .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 13]: Behind it is a splendid prairie , running back for many miles .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 16]: The Falls of St Anthony are not very imposing , although not devoid of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 39]: You can not see the whole of the falls at one view , as they are divided , like those of Niagara , by a large island , about one third of the distance from the eastern shore .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 65]: The river which , as we ascended , poured through a bed below the strata of calcareous rock , now rises above the limestone formation ; and the large masses of this rock , which at the falls have been thrown down in wild confusion over a width of from two hundred to two hundred and fifty yards , have a very picturesque effect .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 43]: The falls themselves , I do not think , are more than from thirty to thirty-five feet high ; but , with rapids above and below them , the descent of the river is said to be more than one hundred feet .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 16]: Like those of Niagara , these falls have constantly receded , and are still receding .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 45]: Here for the first time , I consider that I have seen the Indians in their primitive state ; for till now all that I had fallen in with have been debased by intercourse with the whites , and the use of spirituous liquors .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 28]: The Winnebagos at Prairie du Chien were almost always in a state of intoxication , as were the other tribes at Mackinaw , and on the Lakes .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 33]: The Winnebagos are considered the dirtiest race of Indians , and with the worst qualities : they were formerly designated by the French , _ Puans _ , a term sufficiently explanatory .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 23]: When I was at Prairie du Chien , a circumstance which had occurred there in the previous winter was narrated to me .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 41]: In many points of manners and customs the red men have a strong analogy with the Jewish tribes : among others , an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth , is most strictly adhered to .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 52]: If an Indian of one tribe is killed by an Indian of another , the murderer is demanded , and must either be given up , or his life must be taken by his own tribe : if not , a feud between the two nations would be the inevitable result .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 31]: It appeared that a young Menonnomie , in a drunken fray , had killed a Winnebago , and the culprit was demanded by the head men of the Winnebago tribe .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 20]: A council was held ; and instead of the Menonnomie , the chiefs of the tribe offered them whisky .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 37]: The Winnebagos could not resist the temptation ; and it was agreed that ten gallons of whisky should be produced by the Menonnomies , to be drunk by all parties over the grave of the deceased .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 37]: The squaws of the Menonnomie tribe had to dig the grave , as is the custom , -- a task of no little labour , as the ground was frozen hard several feet below the surface .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 53]: The body was laid in the grave ; the mother of the deceased , with the rest of the Winnebago squaws , howling over it , and denouncing vengeance against the murderer ; but in a short time the whisky made its appearance , and they all set to , to drink .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 18]: In an hour they were all the best friends in the world , and all very drunk .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 47]: The old squaw mother was hugging the murderer of her son ; and it was a scene of intoxication which , in the end , left the majority of the parties assembled , for a time , quite as dead as the man in the grave .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 34]: Such are the effects of whisky upon these people , who have been destroyed much more rapidly by spirituous liquors than by all the wars which they have engaged in against the whites .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 28]: The Sioux are a large band , and are divided into six or seven different tribes ; they are said to amount to from 27,000 to 30,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 45]: They are , or have been , constantly at war with the Chippeways to the north of them , and with Saucs and Foxes , a small but very warlike band , residing to the south of them , abreast of Des Moines River .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 35]: The Sioux have fixed habitations as well as tents ; their tents are large and commodious , made of buffalo skins dressed without the hair , and very often handsomely painted on the outside .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 19]: I went out about nine miles to visit a Sioux village on the borders of a small lake .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 39]: Their lodges were built cottage-fashion , of small fir-poles , erected stockade-wise , and covered inside and out with bark ; the roof also of bark with a hole in the centre for the smoke to escape through .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 58]: I entered one of these lodges : the interior was surrounded by a continued bed-place round three of the sides , about three feet from the floor , and on the platform was a quantity of buffalo skins and pillows ; the fire was in the centre , and their luggage was stowed away under the bed-places .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 25]: It was very neat and clean ; the Sioux generally are , indeed , particularly so , compared with the other tribes of Indians .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 19]: A missionary resides at this village and has paid great attention to the small band under his care .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 38]: Their patches of Indian corn were clean and well tilled ; and although , from demi-civilisation , the people have lost much of their native grandeur , still they are a fine race , and well disposed .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 64]: But the majority of the Sioux tribe remain in their native state : they are _ Horse _ Indians , as those who live on the prairies are termed ; and although many of them have rifles , the majority still adhere to the use of the bow and arrows , both in their war parties and in the chase of the buffalo .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 40]: During the time that I passed here , there were several games of ball played between different bands , and for considerable stakes ; one was played , on the prairie close to the house of the Indian agent .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 67]: The Indian game of ball is somewhat similar to the game of golf in Scotland , with this difference , that the sticks used by the Indians have a small network racket at the end , in which they catch the ball and run away with it , as far as they are permitted , towards the goal , before they throw it in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 20]: It is one of the most exciting games in the world , and requires the greatest activity and address .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 60]: It is , moreover , rendered celebrated in American History from the circumstance that it was used as a stratagem by the renowned leader of the northern tribes , Pontiac , to surprise in one day all the English forts on and near to the lakes , a short time after the Canadas had been surrendered to the British .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 42]: At Mackinaw they succeeded , and put the whole garrison to the sword , as they did at one or two smaller posts ; but at Detroit they were foiled by the plan having been revealed by one of the squaws .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 7]: Pontiac 's plan was as follows .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 35]: Pretending the greatest good-will and friendship , a game of ball was proposed to be played , on the same day , at all the different outposts , for the amusement of the garrisons .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 24]: The interest taken in the game would , of course , call out a proportion of the officers and men to witness it .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 26]: The squaws were stationed close to the gates of the fort , with the rifles of the Indians cut short , concealed under their blankets .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 58]: The ball was , as if by accident , thrown into the fort ; the Indians , as usual , were to rush in crowds after it ; by this means they were to enter the fort , receiving their rifles from their squaws as they hurried in , and then slaughter the weakened and unprepared garrisons .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 93]: Fortunately , Detroit , the most important post , and against which Pontiac headed the stratagem in person , was saved by the previous information given by the squaw ; not that she had any intention to betray him , but the commanding officer having employed her to make him several pairs of moccasins out of an elk skin , desiring her to take the remainder of the skin for the same purpose ; this she refused , saying it was of no use , as he would never see it again .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 12]: This remark excited his suspicions , and led to the discovery .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 44]: The game played before the fort when I was present lasted nearly two hours , during which I had a good opportunity of estimating the agility of the Indians , who displayed a great deal of mirth and humour at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 81]: But the most curious effect produced was by the circumstance , that having divested themselves of all their garments except their middle clothing , they had all of them fastened behind them a horse 's tail ; and as they swept by , in their chase of the ball , with their tails streaming to the wind , I really almost made up my mind that such an appendage was rather an improvement to a man 's figure than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 55]: While I was there a band of Sioux from the _ Lac qui parle _ , -LRB- so named from a remarkable echo there , -RRB- distant about two hundred and thirty miles from Port Snelling , headed by Monsieur Rainville , came down on a visit to the American Fur Company 's factory .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 41]: Monsieur Rainville , -LRB- or _ de _ Rainville , as he told me was his real name , -RRB- is , he asserts , descended from one of the best families is France , which formerly settled in Canada .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 32]: He is a half-breed , his father being a Frenchman , and his mother a Sioux ; his wife is also a Sioux , so that his family are three-quarters red .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 61]: He had been residing many years with the Sioux tribes , trafficking with them for peltry , and has been very judicious in his treatment of them , not interfering with their pursuits of hunting ; he has , moreover , to a certain degree civilised them , and ob -LRB- This chapter is 2 or 3 pages incomplete . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER TWENTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 28]: -LRB- This chapter is 2 or 3 pages incomplete -RRB- my wrist that he might not escape during the night , and tried to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 45]: I rose before daylight on Monday morning , and found that my father had discovered that I had employed the Sabbath in looking for a dog ; and in consequence , as he was a very strict man , I received a severe caning .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 26]: On these memorable occasions , he always used to hold me by the wrist with one hand , while he chastised me with the other .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 59]: I found the best plan was to run round him as fast as I could , which obliged my father to turn round after me with the stick , and then in a short time he left off ; not because he thought I had enough , but because he became so giddy that he could not stand .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 68]: A greater punishment , however , was threatened -- that of not being permitted to go to the bear-hunt , which was to take place on that day ; but I pleaded hard , and asked my father how he would have liked it , if he had been prevented from going to the battle of B -- -LRB- where he had very much distinguished himself -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 23]: This was taking the old man on his weak side , and I was , at last , permitted to be present .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 6]: Then there arose another difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 57]: I was thought too little to carry a gun , which I had provided ; but a neighbour , who had witnessed my anxiety , took my part , said that he would be answerable for me , and that I should not quit his side ; so at last all was settled to my satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 13]: As for the caning , I thought nothing at all of that .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 27]: `` We set off and before we reached the mill , we passed a hollow ; the dog barked furiously , and I let him go .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 11]: After a time I heard a noise in a bush .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 7]: ` Did you not hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 6]: said I to my neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 21]: -- ` Yes , ' replied he ; ` but I also heard a rustling on the bank this way .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 17]: Do you look out sharp in that direction , whilst I look out in this . '
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 42]: He had hardly said so , and I had not turned my head , when out came the old she-bear , in the direction where my neighbour had been watching , and sat upon her hind legs in a clear place .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 16]: My friend levelled his gun ; to my delight he had forgotten to cock it .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 29]: While he was cocking it , the bear dropped down on her fore legs , and I fired ; the ball passed through her chest into her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 21]: She was at that time on the brink of a shelving quarry of sharp stone , down which she retreated .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 28]: I halloo 'd for the dog , and followed , slipping and tumbling after her , for I was mad at the idea of her escaping me .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 21]: Down we went together , the dog following ; when we arrived at the bottom , the dog seized her .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 28]: She was so weak that she supported herself against a rock ; at last she rolled on her back , hogging the dog in her fore paws .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 10]: This was a terrible source of alarm to me .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 49]: I caught the dog by the tail , pulling at it as hard as I could to release him , crying out , although no one was near me , ` Save the dog -- save the dog -- or I 'll have to pay ten dollars . '
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 23]: But , fortunately , the bear , although she held the dog fast , had not sufficient strength left to kill it .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 43]: Other people now came up ; my own musket was down the bear 's throat , where , in my anxiety , I had thrust it ; one of them handed me his , and I shot the bear through the head .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 30]: Even then , so fearful was I of losing my prey , that I seized a large stone and beat the animal on the head till I was exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 6]: Then I had my triumph .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 14]: The Pratts had only killed bear-cubs ; I had killed a full-grown bear .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 30]: I was , as you may suppose , also carried home upon the animal 's back ; and from that day , was pointed out as a bear-hunter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 2]: Secondly .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 9]: `` I was once buffalo hunting in Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 38]: I was on a strong well-trained horse , pursuing a bull , when we arrived at a rent or crack in the prairie , so wide , that it was necessary for the animals to leap it .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 36]: The bull went over first , and I , on the horse , following it close , rose on my stirrups , craning a little , that I might perceive the width of the rent .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 25]: At that moment the bull turned round to charge ; the horse , perceiving it , and knowing his work , immediately wheeled also .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 50]: This sudden change of motion threw me off my saddle , and I remained hanging by the side of the horse , with my leg over his neck : there I was , hanging on only by my leg , with my head downwards below the horse 's belly .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 47]: The bull rushed on to the charge , ranging up to the flank of the horse on the side where I was dangling , and the horse was so encumbered by my weight in that awkward position , that each moment the bull gained upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 41]: At last my strength failed me ; I felt that I could hold on but a few seconds longer ; the head of the bull was close to me , and the steam from his nostrils blew into my face .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 76]: I gave myself up for lost ; all the prayer I could possibly call to mind at the time was , the first two lines of a hymn I used to repeat as a child : -- ` Lord now I lay me down to sleep , ' and that I repeated two or three times , when , fortunately , the horse wheeled short round , evaded the bull , and leaped the gap .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 40]: The bull was at fault ; the jolt of the leap , after nearly dropping me into the gap , threw me up so high , that I gained the neck of my horse , and eventually my saddle .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 23]: I then thought of my rifle , and found that I had held it grasped in my hand during the whole time .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 24]: I wheeled my horse and resumed the chase , and in a minute the bull was dead at my horse 's feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 2]: Thirdly .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 35]: `` I was riding out one day in Arkansas , and it so happened I had not my rifle with me , nor indeed a weapon of any description , not even my jack-knife .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 28]: As I came upon the skirts of a prairie , near a small copse , a buck started out , and dashed away as if much alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 71]: I thought it was my sudden appearance which had alarmed him ; I stopped my horse to look after him , and turning my eyes afterwards in the direction from whence it had started , I perceived , as I thought , on a small mound of earth raised by an animal called a gopher , just the head of the doe , her body concealed by the high grass .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 46]: I had no arms , but it occurred to me , that if I could contrive to crawl up very softly , the high grass might conceal my approach , and I should be able to spring upon her and secure her by main strength .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 23]: ` If I can manage this , ' said I to myself , ` it will be something to talk about . '
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 66]: I tied my horse to a tree , and commenced crawling very softly on my hands and knees towards the gopher hill ; I arrived close to it , and the doe had not started ; I rose gently with both hands ready for a grab , and prepared to spring , slowly raising my head that I might get a sight of the animal .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 32]: It appeared that the animal was equally inquisitive , and wished to gain a sight of me , and it slowly raised its head from the grass as I did mine .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 28]: Imagine what was my surprise and consternation , to find that , instead of a doe , I was face to face with a large male panther .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 17]: It was this brute which had so scared the buck , and now equally scared me .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 28]: There I was , at hardly one yard 's distance from him , without arms of any description , and almost in the paws of the panther .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 53]: I knew that my only chance was keeping my eyes fixed steadfastly on his , and not moving hand or foot ; the least motion to retreat would have been his signal to spring : so there I was , as white as a sheet , with my eyes fixed on him .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 11]: Luckily he did not know what was passing within me .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 19]: For some seconds the animal met my gaze , and I began to give myself up for lost .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 21]: 'T is time for you to go , thought I , or I am gone : will you never go ?
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 46]: At last , the animal blinked , and then his eyes opened like balls of fire ; I remained fascinated as it were ; he blinked again , turned his head a very little , then turned round and went away at a light canter .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 4]: Imagine the relief .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 32]: I hastened back to my horse , and away also went I at a light canter , and with a lighter heart , grateful to Heaven for having preserved me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 6]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER THIRTY .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 28]: The band of warriors attached to Monsieur Rainville have set up their war-tent close to the factory , and have entertained us with a variety of dances .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 90]: Their dresses are very beautiful , and the people , who have been accustomed to witness these exhibitions for years , say that they have never seen any thing equal to them before , I was very anxious to obtain one of them , and applied to Mr Rainville to effect my purpose ; but it required all his influence to induce them to part with it , and they had many arguments and debates among themselves before they could make up their minds to consent to do so .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 30]: I was the more anxious about it , as I had seen Mr Catlin 's splendid exhibition , and I knew that he had not one in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 48]: The dress in question consisted of a sort of kilt of fine skins , ornamented with beautiful porcupine quill-work , and eagle 's feathers ; garters of animals ' tails , worn at their ankles , head-dress of eagle 's feathers and ermine 's tails , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 57]: They made little objection to part with any portions of the dress except the kilt ; at last they had a meeting of the whole band , as the dress was not the property of any one individual ; and I was informed that the warriors would come and have a _ talk _ with me .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 23]: I received them at the factory 's new house , in my room , which was large , and held them all .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 35]: One came and presented me with a pair of garters ; another with a portion of the head-dress ; another with moccasins ; at last , the kilt or girdle was handed to me .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 7]: M. Rainville sat by as interpreter .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 27]: He who had presented me with the kilt or girdle spoke for half a minute , and then stopped while what he said was being interpreted .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 14]: `` You are an Englishman , and a warrior in your own country .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 13]: You cross the great waters as fast as we can our prairies .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 15]: We recollect the English , and we like them ; they used us well .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 35]: The rifles and blankets which they gave us , according to promise , were of good quality : not like the American goods ; their rifles are bad , and their blankets are thin .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 14]: The English keep their word , and they live in our memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 4]: `` Ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 23]: replied I ; which is as much as to say , I understand what you have said , and you may proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 64]: `` You have asked for the dress which we wear when we dance ; we have never parted with one as yet ; they belong to the band of warriors ; when one who has worn a dress goes to the land of spirits , we hold a council , to see who is most worthy to put it on in his place .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 29]: We value them highly ; and we tell you so not to enhance their value , but to prove what we will do for an English warrior . ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 4]: `` Ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 32]: says I. `` An American , in the fort , has tried hard to obtain this dress from us ; he offered us two barrels of flour , and other things .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 31]: You know that we have no game , and we are hungry ; but if he had offered twelve barrels of flour , we would not have parted with them .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 6]: -LRB- This was true . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 21]: But our father , Rainville , has spoken ; and we have pleasure in giving them to an English warrior .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 5]: I have spoken . ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 4]: `` Ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 22]: says I ; upon which the Indian took his seat with the other ; and it was my turn to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 68]: I was very near beginning , `` Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking ; '' but I knew that such an acknowledgment would in their estimation , have very much lessened my value as a warrior ; for , like the Duke of Wellington , one must be as valuable in the council as in the field , to come up to their notions of excellence .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 21]: So I rose , and said -- `` I receive with great pleasure the dress which you have given me .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 32]: -- I know that you do not like to part with it , and that you have refused the American at the fort , and I therefore value it the more .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 54]: I shall never look upon it , when I am on the other side of the great waters , without thinking of my friends the Sioux ; and I will tell my nation that you gave them to me because I was an English warrior , and because you liked the English . ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 4]: `` Ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 10]: grunted the whole conclave , after this was interpreted .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 31]: `` I am very glad that you do not forget the English , and that you say they kept their word , and that their rifles and blankets were good .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 13]: I know that the blankets of the Americans are thin and cold .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 19]: -LRB- I did not think it worth while to say that they were all made in England . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 31]: We have buried the hatchet now ; but should the tomahawk be raised again between the Americans and the English , you must not take part with the Americans . ''
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 4]: `` Ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 3]: said they .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 16]: `` In the Fur Company 's store you will find many things acceptable to you .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 30]: I leave Mr Rainville to select for you what you wish ; and beg you will receive them in return for the present which you have made me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 4]: `` Ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 11]: said they ; and thus ended my first Indian council .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 23]: It is remarkable that the Sioux have no expression to signify , `` I thank you , '' although other Indians have .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 19]: When they receive a present , they always say , _ Wash tay _ : it is good .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 17]: Of all the tribes I believe the Sioux to be the most inimical to the Americans .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 22]: They have no hesitation in openly declaring so ; and it must be acknowledged that it is not without just grounds .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 20]: During the time that I was at St Peters , a council was held at the Indian agent 's .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 84]: It appears that the American Government , in its paternal care for the Indians , had decided that at any _ strike _ taking place between tribes of Indians near to the confines , no war should take place in consequence : that is to say , that should any Indians of one tribe attack or kill any Indians belonging to another , that instead of the tribes going to war , they should apply for and receive redress from the American Government .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 24]: Some time back , a party of Chippeways came down to a trader 's house , about half a mile from Port Snelling .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 37]: Being almost hereditary enemies of the Sioux , they were fired at , at night , by some of the young men of the Sioux village close by , and two of the Chippeways were wounded .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 30]: In conformity with the intimation received , and the law laid down by the American Government , and promulgated by the Indian agent , the Chippeways applied for redress .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 11]: It was granted -- four Sioux were taken and shot .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 68]: This summary justice was expected to produce the best effects , and , had it been followed up , it might have prevented bloodshed : but , since the above occurrence , some Chippeways came down , and meeting a party of Sioux , were received kindly into their lodges ; they returned this hospitality by treacherously murdering eleven of the Sioux , while they were asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 9]: This time the Sioux brought forward their complaint .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 42]: `` You tell us not to go to war ; we will not ; you shot four of our people for wounding two Chippeways ; now do us justice against the Chippeways , who have murdered eleven of our Sioux . ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 11]: As yet no justice has been done to the Sioux .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 53]: The fact is , that the Chippeways live a long way off ; and there are not sufficient men to garrison the fort , still less to send a party out to capture the Chippeways ; and the Sioux are , as may well be supposed , indignant at this partial proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 20]: I was at the council , and heard all the speeches made by the Sioux chiefs on the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 75]: They were some of them very eloquent , and occasionally very severe ; and the reply of the Indian agent must have rendered the American Government very contemptible in the eyes of the Indians -- not that the agent was so much in fault as was the American Government , which , by not taking proper measures to put their promises and agreements into force , had left their officer in such a position .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 63]: First , the Indian agent said , that the wounding of the two Chippeways took place close to the fort , and that it was on account of the insult offered to the _ American flag _ that it was so promptly punished -- a very different explanation , and quite at variance with the principle laid down by the American Government .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 43]: The Indians replied ; and the agent then said , that they had not sufficient troops to defend the fort , and , therefore , could not send out a party ; an admission very unwise to make , although strictly true .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 47]: The Indians again replied ; and then the agent said wait a little till we hear from Washington , and then , if you have no redress , you are brave men , you have arms in your hands , and your enemies are before you .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 70]: This was worse than all , for it implied the inability or the indifference of the American Government to do them justice , and told them , after that government had distinctly declared that they should fight no longer , but receive redress from it , that they now might do what the government had forbidden them to do , and that they had no other chance of redress .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 9]: The result of this council was very unsatisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 21]: The Indian chiefs declared that they were ashamed to look their people in the lace , and walked solemnly away .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 86]: To make this matter still worse , after I left St Peters , I read in the St Louis Gazette a report of some Chippeways having come down , and that , in consequence of the advice given by the Indian agent , the Sioux had taken the law into their own hands and murdered some of the Chippeways ; and that although they had never received redress for the murder of their own people , some of the Sioux were again taken and executed .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 23]: The arms of the Sioux are the rifle , tomahawk , and bow ; they carry spears more for parade than use .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 18]: Their bows are not more than three feet long , but their execution with them is surprising .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 37]: A Sioux , when on horseback chasing the buffalo , will drive his arrow which is about eighteen inches long , with such force that the barb shall appear on the opposite side of the animal .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 44]: And one of their greatest chiefs , _ Wanataw _ , has been known to kill two buffaloes with one arrow , it having passed through the first of the animals , and mortally wounded the second on the other side of it .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 40]: I was about two hundred yards from the fort , and asked a Sioux if he could send his arrow into one of the apertures for air , which were near the foundation , and about three inches wide .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 11]: It appeared more like a thread from where we stood .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 20]: He took his bow , and apparently with a most careless aim he threw the arrow right into it .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 24]: The men are tall and straight , and very finely made , with the exception of their arms , which are too small .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 17]: The arms of the squaws , who do all the labour , are much more muscular .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 20]: One day , as I was on the prairie , I witnessed the effect of custom upon these people .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 30]: A Sioux was coming up without perceiving me ; his squaw followed very heavily laden , and to assist her he had himself a large package on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 28]: As soon as they perceived me , he dropped his burden , and it was taken up by the squaw and added to what she had already .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 25]: If a woman wishes to upbraid another , the severest thing she can say is , `` You let your husband carry burthens . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER THIRTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 4]: Left St Peters .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 25]: Taking the two varieties in the mass , the Indians must be acknowledged the most perfect gentlemen in America , particularly in their deportment .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 27]: It was with regret that I parted with my friends in the fort , my kind host , Mr Sibley , and my noble-minded warrior Sioux .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 29]: I could have remained at St Peters for a year with pleasure , and could only regret that life was so short , and the Mississippi so long .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 48]: There is , however , one serious drawback in all America to life in the woods , or life in cities , or every other kind of life ; which is the manner , go where you will , in which you are pestered by the mosquitoes .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 50]: Strangers are not the only sufferers ; those who are born and die in the country are equally tormented , and it is slap , slap , slap , all day and all night long , for these animals bite through everything less thick than a buffalo 's skin .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 31]: As we ascended the river they attacked us on the crown of the head -- a very unusual thing , -- and raised swellings as large as pigeons ' eggs .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 16]: I must have immolated at least five hundred of them upon my bump of benevolence .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 23]: Whatever people may think , I feel that no one can be very imaginative where these animals are so eternally tormenting them .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 49]: You meditate under the shady boughs of some forest-king -LRB- slap knee , slap cheek -RRB- , and farewell to anything like concentration of thought ; you ponder on the sailing moon -LRB- clap again , right and left , above , below -RRB- , always unpleasantly interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 19]: It wo n't do at all : you are teased and phlebotomised out of all poetry and patience .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 69]: It is midnight , the darkness is intense , not even a star in the heavens above , and the steamboat appears as if it were gliding through a current of ink , with black masses rising just perceptible on either side of it ; no sound except the reiterated note of the `` Whip poor Will , '' answered by the loud coughing of the high-pressure engine .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 32]: Who , of those in existence fifty years ago , would have contemplated that these vast and still untenanted solitudes would have had their silence invaded by such an unearthly sound ?
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 11]: a sound which ever gives you the idea of vitality .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 26]: It is this appearance of breathing which makes the high-pressure engine the nearest approach to creation which was ever attained by the ingenuity of man .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 65]: It appears to have respiration , and that short , quick respiration occasioned by exertion ; its internal operations are performed as correctly and as mechanically as are our own ; it is as easily put out of order and rendered useless as we are ; and like us , it can only continue its powers of motion by being well supplied with aliment .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 15]: Ran up Fever River to Galena , the present emporium of the Mineral Country .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 25]: There is an unpleasant feeling connected with the name of this river ; it is , in fact , one of the American translations .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 22]: It was originally called Feve , or Bean River , by the French , and this they have construed into Fever .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 36]: The Mineral district comprehends a tract of country running about one hundred miles North and South , and fifty miles East and West , from the River Wisconsin to about twenty miles south of Galena .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 29]: It was purchased by the American Government about fifteen years ago , the northern portion from the Winnebagos , and the southern from the Sioux and Fox Indians .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 24]: The Indians used to work the diggings to a small extent , bringing the lead which they obtained to exchange with the traders .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 24]: As may be supposed , they raised but little , the whole work of digging and smelting being carried on by the squaws .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 40]: After the land was surveyed a portion of it was sold , but when the minerals made their appearance the fact was notified by the surveyors to the government , and the remaining portions were withdrawn from the market .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 29]: A licence was granted to speculators to dig the ore and smelt it , upon condition of their paying to the government a percentage on the mineral obtained .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 27]: Those who found a good vein had permission to work it for forty yards square on condition that they carried the ore to a licensed smelter .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 53]: This occasioned a new class of people to spring up in this speculative country , namely , _ finders _ , who would search all over the country for what they called a good _ prospect _ , that is , every appearance on the surface of a good vein of metal .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 46]: This when found they would sell to others , who would turn _ diggers _ ; and as soon as these finders had spent their money , they would range over the whole country to find another _ prospect _ which they might dispose of .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 60]: But although it was at first supposed that the government had retained all the mineral portion of the district in its own hands , it was soon discovered that nearly the whole country was one continued lead mine , and that there was an equal supply of mineral to be obtained from those portions which had been disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 20]: Lead was found not only in the mountains and ravines , but under the surface of the wide prairies .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 41]: As the lands sold by government had not to pay a percentage for the lead raised from them , those who worked upon the government lands refused to pay any longer , asserting that it was not _ legal _ .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 33]: The superintendent of government soon found that his office was a sinecure , as all attempt at _ coercion _ in that half-civilised country would have been not only useless but dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 30]: The government have gone to law with their tenants , but that is of no avail , for a verdict against the latter would not induce them to pay .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 32]: The cause was not attempted to be tried at Galena , for the government knew what the decision of the jury would have been , but it is contested at Vandalia .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 33]: It is three years since the mines have paid any percentage , and the government are now advised to sell all their reserved lands , and thus get rid of the business .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 21]: How weak must that government be when it is compelled to submit to such a gross violation of all justice .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 40]: The quantity of mineral found does not appear to affect the quality of the soil , which is as fine here , if not finer , than in those portions of Wisconsin where the mineral is not so plentiful .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 17]: The quantity of lead annually smelted is said to amount to from 18,000,000 to 20,000,000 lbs .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 19]: Galena is a small town , picturesquely situated on the banks of the river , but very dirty .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 32]: Ioway , the new district opposite to Wisconsin , on the western banks of the Mississippi , has , in all probability , a large proportion of metal under its surface .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 108]: When it was in the possession of the Sioux Indians , they used to obtain from it a considerable portion of lead , which they brought down to barter ; and I am inclined to think , that to the north of the Wisconsin river , they will find no want of minerals , even as high up as Lake Superior , where they have already discovered masses of native copper weighing many _ tons _ : and on the west side of the river , as you proceed south , you arrive at the iron mines , or rather mountains of iron , in the Missouri .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 45]: After you proceed south of Prairie du Chien , the features of the Mississippi river gradually change ; the bluffs decrease in number and in height , until you descend to Rock Island , below which point they are rarely to be met with .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 21]: The country on each side now is chiefly composed of variegated rolling prairies , with a less proportion of timber .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 51]: To describe these prairies would be difficult ; that is , to describe the effect of them upon a stranger : I have found myself lost , as it were ; and indeed sometimes , although on horseback , have lost myself , having only the sun for my guide .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 33]: Look round in every quarter of the compass , and there you are as if on the ocean -- not a landmark , not a vestige of any thing human but yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 61]: Instead of sky and water , it is one vast field , bounded only by the horizon , its surface gently undulating like the waves of the ocean ; and as the wind -LRB- which always blows fresh on the prairies -RRB- bows down the heads of the high grass , it gives you the idea of a running swell .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 68]: Every three or four weeks there is a succession of beautiful flowers , giving a variety of tints to the whole map , which die away and are succeeded by others equally beautiful ; and in the spring , the strawberries are in such profusion , that you have but to sit down wherever you may happen to be , and eat as long as you please .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 21]: We stopped at Alton , in the State of Missouri , to put on shore three thousand pigs of lead .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 44]: This town has been rendered notorious by the murder -- for murder it was , although it was brought on by his own intemperate conduct -- of Mr Lovejoy , who is now raised to the dignity of a martyr by the abolitionists .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 42]: Alton is a well-built town , of stone , and , from its locality , must increase ; it is , however , spoilt by the erection of a penitentiary with huge walls , on a most central and commanding situation .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 30]: I read a sign put out by a small eating-house , and which was very characteristic of the country -- `` Stranger , here 's your chicken fixings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 54]: Four miles below Alton , the Missouri joins its waters with the Mississippi ; and the change which takes place at the mingling of the two streams is very remarkable -- the clear pellucid current of the upper Mississippi being completely extinguished by the foul mud of the other turbid and impetuous river .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 73]: It was a great mistake of the first explorers , when they called the western branch , at the meeting of the two rivers , the Missouri , and the eastern the Mississippi : the western branch , or the Missouri , is really the Mississippi , and should have been so designated : it is the longest and farthest navigable of the two branches , and therefore is the main river .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 52]: The Falls of St Anthony put an end to the navigation of the eastern branch , or present upper Missouri , about nine hundred miles above St Louis ; while the western branch , or present Missouri , is navigable above St Louis for more than one thousand two hundred miles .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 85]: The waters of the present upper Mississippi are clear and beautiful ; it is a swift , but not an angry stream , full of beauty and freshness , and fertilising as it sweeps along ; while the Missouri is the same impetuous , discoloured , devastating current as the Mississippi continues to be after its junction -- like it , constantly sweeping down forests of trees in its wild course , overflowing , inundating , and destroying , and exciting awe and fear .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 21]: As soon as you arrive at St Louis , you feel that you are on the great waters of Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 25]: St Louis is a well-built town , now containing about twenty thousand inhabitants , and situated on a hill shelving down to the river .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 46]: The population increases daily ; the river a-breast of the town is crowded with steamboats , lying in two or three tiers , and ready to start up or down , or to the many tributary navigable rivers which pour their waters into the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 26]: In point of heat , St Louis certainly approaches the nearest to the Black Hole of Calcutta of any city that I have sojourned in .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 14]: The lower part of the town is badly drained , and very filthy .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 18]: The flies , on a moderate calculation , are in many parts fifty to the square inch .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 29]: I wonder that they have not a contagious disease here during the whole summer ; it is , however , indebted to heavy rains for its occasional purification .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 30]: They have not the yellow-fever here ; but during the autumn they have one which , under another name , is almost as fatal -- the bilious congestive fever .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 28]: I found sleep almost impossible from the sultriness of the air , and used to remain at the open window for the greater part of the night .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 31]: I did not expect that the muddy Mississippi would be able to reflect the silver light of the moon ; yet it did , and the effect was very beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 23]: Truly it may be said of this river , as it is of many ladies , that it is a candle-light beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 32]: There is another serious evil to which strangers who sojourn here are subject -- the violent effects of the waters of the Mississippi upon those who are not used to them .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 32]: The suburbs of the town are very pretty ; and a few miles behind it you are again in a charming prairie country , full of game , large and small .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 9]: Large and small are only so by comparison .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 12]: An American was asked what game they had in his district ?
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 32]: and his reply was , `` Why , we 've plenty of _ baar _ -LRB- bear -RRB- and deer , but no _ large _ game to count on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 39]: There is one great luxury in America , which is the quantity of clear pure ice which is to be obtained wherever you are , even in the hottest seasons , and ice-creams are universal and very cheap .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 56]: I went into an establishment where they vended this and other articles of refreshment , when about a dozen black swarthy fellows , employed at the iron-foundry close at hand , with their dirty shirt-sleeves tucked up , and without their coats and waistcoats , came in , and sitting down , called for ice-creams .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 24]: Miss Martineau says in her work , `` Happy is the country where factory-girls can carry parasols , and pig-drivers wear spectacles . ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 13]: She might have added , and the sons of Vulcan eat ice-creams .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 60]: I thought at the time what the ladies , who stop in their carriages at Gunter 's , would have said , had they behold these Cyclops with their bare sinewy arms , blackened with heat and smoke , refreshing themselves with such luxuries ; but it must be remembered that _ porter _ is much the dearer article .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 30]: Still the working classes all over America can command not only all necessary comforts , but many luxuries ; for labour is dear and they are very well paid .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 26]: The Americans will point this out and say , behold the effects of our institutions ; and they fully believe that such is the case .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 18]: Government has , however , nothing to do with it ; it is the result of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 33]: When two years ' exertion will procure a clever mechanic an independence , the effects will be the same , whether they labour under a democratic or a monarchical form of government .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 31]: Bear cubs -LRB- I mean the black bear -RRB- are caught and brought down to the cities on this side of the river , to be fattened for the table .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 35]: I saw one at Alton about a year old , which the owner told me was to be killed the next day , having been bespoken for the feast of the 4th of July .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 20]: I have eaten old bear , which I dislike ; but they say that the cub is very good .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 19]: I also saw here a very fine specimen of the grizzly bear -LRB- Ursus Horridus of Linnaeus -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 25]: It was about two years old , and although not so tall , it must have weighed quite as much as a good-sized bullock .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 30]: Its width of shoulder and apparent strength were enormous , and they have never yet been tamed : Mr Van Amburgh would be puzzled to handle one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 37]: The Indians reckon the slaying of one of these animals as a much greater feat than killing a man , and the proudest ornament they can wear is a necklace of the grizzly bear 's claws .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 44]: I for myself , must confess , that I had rather be attacked by , and take my chance with , three men than by one of these animals , as they are seldom killed by the first or even the second bullet .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 7]: It requires numbers to overcome them .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 25]: The largest lion , or Bengal tiger , would stand but a poor chance , if opposed to one of these animals full grown .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 59]: One of the gentlemen employed by the Fur Company told me , that he once saw a grizzly bear attack a bull buffalo , and that , at the first seizure , he tore one of the ribs of the buffalo out of his side , and eventually carried away the whole carcass , without much apparent effort .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 22]: They are only to be found in the rocky mountains , and valleys between them , when the game is plentiful .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 4]: Visited the museum .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 21]: There were once five large alligators to be seen alive in this museum ; but they are now all dead .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 14]: One demands our sympathy , as there was something Roman in his fate .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 30]: Unable to support such a life of confinement , and preferring death to the loss of liberty , he committed suicide by throwing himself out of a three-storey-high window .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 33]: He was taken up from the pavement the next morning ; the vital spark had fled , as the papers say , and , I believe , his remains were decently interred .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 38]: The other four , never having been taught in their youth the hymn , `` Birds in their little nests agree , '' fought so desperately , that one by one they all died of their wounds .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 13]: They were very large , being from seventeen to twenty-one feet long .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 29]: One , as a memorial , remains preserved in the museum , and to make him look more poetical , he has a stuffed negro in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER THIRTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 52]: Thank Heaven I have escaped from St Louis ; during the time that I remained in that city , I was , day and night , so melting away , that I expected , like some of the immortal half-breeds of Jupiter , to become a tributary stream to the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 58]: As you descend the river the land through which it flows becomes more level and flat , while the size of the forest trees increases ; the log houses of the squatters , erected on the banks under their trunks , appear , in contrast with their size , more like dog-kennels than the habitations of men .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 39]: The lianes , or creeping plants , now become plentiful , and embrace almost every tree , rising often to the height of fifty or sixty feet , and encircling them with the apparent force of the boa-constrictor .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 31]: Most of them are poisonous ; indeed , it is from these creeping parasites that the Indians , both in North and South America , obtain the most deadly venom .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 46]: Strange that these plants , in their appearances and their habits so similar to the serpent tribe , should be endowed with the same peculiar attributes , and thus become their parallels in the vegetable kingdom -- each carrying sudden death in their respective juices .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 75]: I hate the Mississippi , and as I look down upon its wild and filthy waters , boiling and eddying , and reflect how uncertain is travelling in this region of high-pressure , and disregard of social rights , I can not help feeling a disgust at the idea of perishing in such a vile sewer , to be buried in mud , and perhaps to be rooted out again by some pig-nosed alligator .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 23]: Right glad was I when we turned into the stream of the Ohio , and I found myself on its purer waters .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 53]: The Ohio is a splendid river , running westward from the chain of Alleghany mountains into the Mississippi , dividing the States of Illinois , Indiana , and Ohio on its northern bank from Kentucky , and Virginia on its south ; the northern being free , and the southern slave States .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 16]: We stopped at the month of the Cumberland river , where we took in passengers .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 14]: Among others were a slave-dealer and a runaway negro whom he had captured .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 38]: He was secured by a heavy chain , and followed his master , who , as soon as he arrived on the upper deck , made him fast with a large padlock to one of the stancheons .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 47]: Here he remained looking wistfully at the northern shore , where every one was free , but occasionally glancing his eye on the southern , which had condemned him to toil for others , I had never seen a slave-dealer , and scrutinised this one severely .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 24]: His most remarkable feature was his eye ; it was large but not projecting , clear as crystal , and eternally in motion .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 37]: I could not help imagining , as he turned it right and left from one to the other of the passengers , that he was calculating what price he could obtain for them in the market .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 67]: The negro had run away about seven months before , and not having a pass , he had been secured in goal until the return of his master , who had been on a journey with a string of slaves , to the State of Arkansas : he was about to be sold to pay expenses , when his master saw the advertisement and claimed him .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 22]: As may be supposed , a strong feeling exists on the opposite shores of the river as to slavery and freedom .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 54]: The Abolitionists used to assist the slaves to escape , and send them off to Canada ; even now many do escape ; but this has been rendered more difficult by a system which has latterly been put in practice by a set of miscreants living on the free side of the river .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 44]: These would go to the slave states opposite , and persuade the negroes to run away , promising to conceal them until they could send them off to Canada ; for a free state is bound to give up a slave when claimed .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 34]: Instead of sending them away , they would wait until the reward was offered by the masters for the apprehension of the slaves , and then return them , receiving their infamous guerdon .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 14]: The slaves , aware of this practice , now seldom attempt to escape .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 28]: Louisville is the largest city in Kentucky ; the country about is very rich , and every thing vegetable springs up with a luxuriance which is surprising .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 58]: It is situated at the falls of the Ohio , which are only navigable during the freshets ; there is no river in America which has such a rise and fall as the Ohio , sometimes rising to sixty feet in the spring ; but this is very rare , the general average being about forty feet .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 38]: The French named it La Belle Riviere : it is a very grand stream , running through hills covered with fine timber and underwood ; but a very small portion is as yet cleared by the settlers .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 57]: At the time that I was at Louisville the water was lower than it had been remembered for years , and you could walk for miles over the bed of the river , a calcareous deposite full of interesting fossils ; but the mineralogist and geologist have as much to perform in America as the agriculturist .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 4]: Arrived at Cincinnati .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 11]: How rapid has been the advance of this western country .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 34]: In 1803 , deer-skin at the value of forty cents per pound , were a legal tender ; and if offered instead of money could not be refused -- even by a lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 45]: Not fifty years ago , the woods which towered where Cincinnati is now built , resounded only to the cry of the wild animals of the forest , or the rifle of the Shawnee Indian ; now Cincinnati contains a population of 40,000 inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 24]: It is a beautiful , well built , clean town , reminding you more of Philadelphia than any other city in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 48]: Situated on a hill on the banks of the Ohio , it is surrounded by a circular phalanx of other hills ; so that look up and down the streets , whichever way you will , your eye reposes upon verdure and forest trees in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 41]: The streets have a row of trees on each side , near the curb-stone ; and most of the houses have a small frontage , filled with luxuriant flowering shrubs , of which the Althea Frutex is the most abundant .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 46]: It is , properly speaking , a Yankee city , the majority of its inhabitants coming from the East ; but they have intermarried , and blended with the Kentuckians of the opposite shore , a circumstance which is advantageous to the character of both .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 19]: There are , however , a large number of Dutch and German settlers here ; they say 10,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 57]: They are not much liked by the Americans but have great influence , as may be conceived when it is stated that , when a motion was brought forward , in the Municipal Court , for the city regulations to be printed in German as well as English , it was lost by one vote only .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 25]: I was told a singular fact , which will prove how rapidly the value of land rises in this country as it becomes peopled .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 60]: Fifty-six years ago , the major part of the land upon which the city of Cincinnati stands , and which is now worth many millions of dollars , was _ swapped _ away by the owner of it for a pony !! The man who made this unfortunate bargain is now alive , and living in or near Cincinnati .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 38]: Cincinnati is the pork-shop of the Union ; and in the autumnal , and early winter months , the way they kill pigs here is , to use a Yankee phrase , _ quite a caution _ .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 43]: Almost all the hogs fed in the oak forests of Ohio , Kentucky , and Western Virginia , are driven into this city , and some establishments kill as many as fifteen hundred a day ; at least so I am told .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 39]: They are despatched in a way quite surprising ; and a pig is killed upon the same principle as a pin is made , -- by division , or , more properly speaking , by combination of labour .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 57]: The hogs confined in a large pen are driven into a smaller one ; one man knocks them on the head with a sledge hammer , and then cuts their throats ; two more pull away the carcase , when it is raised by two others , who tumble it into a tub of scalding water .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 28]: His bristles are removed in about a minute and a half by another party ; when the next duty is to fix a stretcher between his legs .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 60]: It is then hoisted up by two other people , cut open , and disembowelled ; and in three minutes and a half from the time that the hog was grunting in his obesity , he has only to get cold before he is again packed up , and reunited in a barrel to travel all over the world .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 14]: By the by , we laugh at the notion of pork and molasses .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 33]: In the first place , the American pork is far superior to any that we ever have salted down ; and , in the next , it eats uncommonly well with molasses .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 15]: I have tasted it , and '' _ it is a fact _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 25]: After all , why should we eat currant jelly with venison , and not allow the Americans the humble imitation of pork and molasses ?
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 39]: Mrs Trollope 's bazaar raises its head in a very imposing manner : it is composed of many varieties of architecture ; but I think the order under which it must be classed is the _ preposterous _ .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 25]: They call it Trollope 's folly ; and it is remarkable how a shrewd woman like Mrs Trollope should have committed such an error .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 66]: A bazaar like an English bazaar is only to be supported in a city which has arrived at the acme of luxury ; where there are hundreds of people willing to be employed for a trifle ; hundreds who will work at trifles , for want of better employment ; and thousands who will spend money on trifles , merely to pass away their time .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 62]: Now , in America , in the first place , there is no one who makes trifles ; no one who will devote their time , as sellers of the articles unless well compensated ; and no one who will be induced , either by fashion or idleness , to give a halfpenny more for a thing than it is worth .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 12]: In consequence , nothing was sent to Mrs Trollope 's bazaar .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 51]: She had to furnish it from the shops , and had to pay very high salaries to the young women who attended ; and the people of Cincinnati , aware that the same articles were to be purchased at the stores for less money , preferred going to the stores .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 9]: No wonder then that it was a failure .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 15]: It is now used as a dancing academy , and occasionally as an assembly-room .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 71]: Whatever the society of Cincinnati may have been at the time that Mrs Trollope resided there , I can not pretend to say ; probably some change may have taken place in it ; but at present it is as good as any in the Union , and infinitely more agreeable than in some other cities , as in it there is a mixture of the southern frankness of character .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 84]: A lady , who had long resided at Cincinnati , told me that they were not angry with Mrs Trollope for having described the society which she saw , but for having asserted that that was the best society ; and she further remarked , -- `` It is fair to us that it should be understood that when Mrs Trollope came here , she was quite unknown , except inasmuch as that she was a married woman , travelling without her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 38]: In a small society , as ours was , it was not surprising , therefore , that we should be cautious about receiving a lady who , in our opinion was offending against _ les bienseances _ .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 44]: Observe , _ we do not accuse Mrs Trollope of any impropriety _ ; but you must be aware how necessary it is , in this country , to be regardful of appearances , and how afraid every one is of their neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 30]: Mrs Trollope then took a cottage on the hill , and used to come down to the city to market , and attend to the erection of her bazaar .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 32]: I have now told you all that we know about her , and the reason why she did not receive those attentions , the omission of which caused her indignation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 33]: I think it but fair that the lady 's explanation should be given , as Mrs Trollope is considered to have been very severe and very unjust by the inhabitants of Cincinnati .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 81]: The fact is , that Mrs Trollope 's representation of the manners and custom of Cincinnati , at the period when she wrote , was probably more correct than the present inhabitants of the city will allow : that it would be a libel upon the Cincinnatians of the present day is certain ; whether it was one at the time she wrote , and the city was , comparatively speaking , in its infancy , is quite another affair .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 37]: However , one thing is certain , which is , that the Americans have quite forgiven Mrs Trollope , and if she were again to cross the water , I think she would be well received .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 38]: Her book made them laugh , though at their own expense ; and the Americans , although appearances are certainly very much against it , are really , at the bottom , a very good tempered people .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 43]: The heat has been this year very remarkable all over the Western country , and the drought equally uncommon , the thermometer standing from 100 degrees to 106 degrees , in the shade , every where from St Peters to New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 19]: It is very dangerous to drink iced water , and many have died from yielding to the temptation .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 28]: One young man came into the bar of the hotel where I resided , drank a glass of water , and fell down dead at the porch .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 30]: This reminds me of an ingenious plan put in practice by a fellow who had drunk every cent out of his pocket , and was as thirsty as ever .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 26]: The best remedy , in case of a person being taken ill from drinking cold water , is to pour brandy down his throat immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 87]: Aware of this , the fellow used to go to one of the pumps , pump away , and pretend to drink water in large quantities ; he would then fall down by the pump , as if he had been taken suddenly ill ; out would run people from every house , with brandy , and pour it down his throat till even he had had enough ; he would then pretend gradually to recover , thank them for their kindness , and walk away .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 32]: When he required another dose , he would perform the same farce at another pump ; and this he continued to do for some time , before his trick was discovered .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 14]: I had two good specimens of democracy during my stay in this city .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 39]: I sent for a tailor to take my measure for a coat , and he returned for answer , that such a proceeding was not _ republican _ , and that I must _ go to him _ .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 27]: A young lady , with whom I was acquainted , was married during the time I was there , and the marriage-party went a short tour .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 41]: On their return , when but a few miles from the city , they ordered the driver of the carriage to put his horses to , that they might proceed ; he replied that he would take them no further .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 54]: On inquiring the cause of his refusal , he said that he had not been treated as a gentleman ; that they had had private meals every day , and had not asked him to the table ; that they had used him very ill , and that he would drive no more .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 20]: Things appear to be fast verging to the year 1920 , or thereabouts , as described by Theodore Hook .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 33]: A duchess wishing for a drive , the old mare sends an answer from the stable , that `` She 'll be d -- d if she 'll go out today . ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 20]: Left Cincinnati , in a very small steam-boat , for Guyandotte , on my way to the Virginia Springs .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 119]: I have often heard the expression of `` Hell afloat '' applied to very uncomfortable ships in the service , but this metaphor ought to have been reserved for a small high-pressure steamboat in the summer months in America ; the sun darting his fierce rays down upon the roof above you , which is only half-inch plank , and rendering it so hot that you quickly remove your hand if , by chance , you put it there ; the deck beneath your feet so heated by the furnaces below that you can not walk with slippers ; you are panting and exhausted between these two fires , without a breath of air to cool your forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 15]: Go forward , and the chimneys radiate a heat which is even more intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 20]: Go -- but there is no where to go , except overboard , and then you lose your passage .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 25]: It is , really , a fiery furnace , and , day or night , it is in vain to seek a cool retreat .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 11]: As we proceeded up the river , things became worse .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 44]: We had not proceeded more than twenty miles , when a larger steamboat , which had started an hour before us , was discovered aground on a bar , which , from the low state of the river , she could not pass .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 36]: After a parley between the captains , we went alongside and took out all her passengers , amounting to upward of a hundred , being more than we were on board of our own vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 19]: But they behaved like pirates , and treated us just as if we had been a captured vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 24]: Dinner was just ready ; they sat down and took possession of it , leaving us to wait till the table was replenished .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 35]: A young Englishman had just taken his seat by me , when a very queer-looking man came up to him and begged that he would give up his place to a _ lady _ .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 21]: Aware of the custom of the country , he immediately resigned his seat , and went to look for another .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 31]: When the lady took her seat by me I involuntarily drew my chair to a more respectful distance , there being something so particularly uninviting in her ladyship 's appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 34]: On our arrival at Maysville , this lady , with her gentleman , told the captain that they were sorry they had not a cent wherewith to defray the expenses of their passage .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 47]: Their luggage had been landed before this declaration was made , but it was immediately ordered on board again by the captain ; and as , of course , they would not part with their goods and chattels , they remained on board of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 35]: The captain took them to the river about twenty miles further , and then landed them on the bank , with their luggage , to find their way back to Maysville how they could .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 54]: This is the usual punishment for such trial-practices ; but , after all , it is only the punishment of delay , as they would hail the first boat which came down the river , make out a piteous tale of ill-treatment , be received on board , and landed at their destination .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 31]: This reminds me of a clever trick played by a Yankee pedlar upon one of the captains of the steamboats running from New York to Albany on the Hudson river .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 40]: The Yankee was fully aware of this custom of putting people on shore who attempted to gain a passage for nothing , and his destination was to a place called Poughkeepsie , about halfway between New York and Albany .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 26]: He , therefore , waited very quietly until he was within a mile or two of Poughkeepsie , and then went up to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 103]: -- `` Well , now , Captain , I like to do things on the square , that 's a fact ; -- I might have said nothing to you , and run up all the way to Albany -- and to Albany I must go on most particular business -- that 's a fact ; but I thought it more honourable-like to tell you at once -- I hav ` nt got a cent in my pocket ; I 've been unfortunate ; but , by the ` tarnal I 'll pay you my passage-money as soon as I get it .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 35]: You see I tell you now , that you may ` nt say that I cheat you ; for pay you I will as soon as I can , that 's a fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 50]: The captain , indignant , as usual , at being tricked , called him certain names , swore a small quantity , and as soon as he arrived at Poughkeepsie , as a punishment put him ashore at the very place the keen Yankee wished to be landed at .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 11]: The Ohio river becomes much more rapid as you ascend .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 47]: Abreast of Guyandotte , where we landed , the current was so strong that it was very difficult for men to wade across it , and the steamboats running against the stream could not gain more than a mile in the course of half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 30]: On board of this steamboat was a negro woman , very neatly dressed , with a very good-looking negro child , about nine months old , in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 16]: It was of the darkest ebony in colour , and its dress rather surprised me .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 42]: It was a chali frock , of a neat fawn coloured pattern , with fine muslin trousers edged with Valenciennes lace at the bottom ; and very pretty did its little tiny black feet look , relieved by these expensive unnecessaries .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 51]: I did not inquire who the young gentleman was ; but I thought what pleasure the sight of him would have given Miss Martineau , who , as I have before observed , exclaims , `` Happy is the country where factory-girls carry parasols , and pig-drivers wear spectacles . ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 29]: How much more happy must be that country where a little black boy , of nine months old , wears Valenciennes lace at the bottom of his trousers !
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 35]: It is , however a question of figures , and may be solved , not by the rule of three , but by the rule of five , which follows it in the arithmetic-book .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 9]: I leave Miss Martineau to make the calculation .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER THIRTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 9]: There is extreme beauty in the Ohio river .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 42]: As may be supposed , where the rise and fall are so great the banks are very steep ; and , now that the water is low , it appears deeply embedded in the wild forest scenery through which it flows .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 96]: The whole stream is alive with small fresh-water turtle , who play on the surface of its clear water ; while the more beautiful varieties of the butterfly tribe cross over from one side to the other , from the slave States to the free -- their liberty , at all events , not being interfered with as , on the free side , it would be thought absurd to catch what would not produce a cent ; while , on the slaves ' , their idleness and their indifference to them are their security .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 17]: Set off , one of nine , in a stage-coach , for the Blue Sulphur springs .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 13]: The country , which is very picturesque , has been already described .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 16]: It is one continuation of rising ground , through mountains covered with trees and verdure .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 9]: Nature is excessively fond of drapery in America .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 11]: I have never yet fallen in with a naked rock .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 34]: She clothes every thing ; and although you may occasionally meet with a slight nudity , it is no more than the exposure of the neck or the bare feet of the mountain-nymph .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 38]: This ridge of the Alleghanies is very steep ; but you have no distinct view as you climb up , not even at the Hawk 's Nest , where you merely peep down into the ravine below .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 50]: You are jammed up in the forests through which you pass nearly the whole of the way ; and it was delightful to arrive at any level , and fall in with the houses and well-tilled fields of the Virginian farmers , exhibiting every proof of prosperity and ease .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 47]: The heat was dreadful ; two horses fell dead , and I thought that many others would have died , for two of the wheels were defective , and the labour of the poor animals , in dragging us constantly up hill , was most severe .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 64]: The indifference of the proprietors of public conveyances in America as to the safety of their passengers , can only be accounted for by the extreme indifference of the passengers themselves , and the independent feeling shewn by every class , who , whatever may be their profession , will never acknowledge themselves to be what we term the servants of the public .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 5]: Here was an instance .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 28]: The coach we were put into was defective in two of its wheels , and could only be repaired at Louisburg , about a hundred miles distant .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 74]: Instead of sending it on to that town empty , as would have been done by our coach proprietors , and providing another -LRB- as they had plenty -RRB- , for the passengers ; instead of this , in order to save the extra trouble and expense , they risked the lives of the passengers on a road with a precipice on one side of it for at least four-fifths of the way .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 32]: One of the wheels would not hold the grease , and creaked most ominously during the whole journey ; and we were obliged to stop and pour water on it continually .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 30]: The box and irons of the other were loose , and before we were half way it came off , and we were obliged to stop and get out .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 17]: But the Americans are never at a loss when they are in a _ fix _ .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 39]: The passengers borrowed an axe ; in a short time wedges were cut from one of the trees at the road-side , and the wheel was so well repaired that it lasted us the remainder of our journey .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 27]: Our road for some time lay through the valley of Kenawha , through which runs the river of that name -- a strong , clear stream .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 34]: It is hemmed in by mountains on each side of it ; and here , perhaps , is presented the most curious varieties of mineral produce that ever were combined in one locality .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 58]: The river runs over a bed of horizontal calcareous strata , and by perforating this strata about forty or fifty feet below the level of the river , you arrive at salt-springs , the waters of which are pumped up by small steam-engines , and boiled down into salt in buildings erected on the river 's banks .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 44]: The mountains which hem in the river are one mass of coal ; a gallery is opened at that part of the foot of the mountain most convenient to the buildings , and the coal is thrown down by shoots or small railways .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 47]: Here you have coal for your fuel ; salt water under fresh ; and as soon as the salt is put into the barrels -LRB- which are also made from the mountain timber -RRB- , the river is all ready to transplant them down to Ohio .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 44]: But there is another great curiosity in this valley : these beds of coal have produced springs , as they are termed , of carburetted hydrogen gas , which run along the banks of the river close to the water 's - edge .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 33]: The negroes take advantage of these springs when they come down at night to wash clothes ; they set fire to the springs , which yield them sufficient light for their work .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 17]: The one which I examined was dry , and the gas bubbled up through the sand .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 30]: By kicking the sand about , so as to make communications after I had lighted the gas , I obtained a very large flame , which I left burning .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 36]: The heat , as we ascended , was excessive , and the passengers availed themselves of every spring , with the exception of those just described , that they fell in with on the route .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 37]: We drank of every variety of water excepting pure water -- sometimes iron , sometimes sulphur ; and , indeed , every kind of chalybeate , for every rill was impregnated in some way or another .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 44]: At last , it occurred to me that there were such things as chemical affinities , and that there was no saying what changes might take place by the admixture of such a variety of metals and gases , so drank no more .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 65]: I did not like , however , to interfere with the happiness of others , so I did not communicate my ideas to my fellow-passengers , who continued drinking during the whole day ; and as I afterwards found out , did not sleep very well that night ; they were , moreover , very sparing in the use of them the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 23]: There are a great variety of springs already discovered on these mountains , and probably there will be a great many more .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 81]: Already they have the blue , the white , and the red sulphur springs ; the sweet and the salt ; the warm and the hot , all of which have their several virtues ; but the greatest virtue of all these mineral springs is , as in England and every where else , that they occasion people to live regularly , to be moderate in the use of wine , and to dwell in a pure and wholesome air .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 64]: They always remind me of the eastern story of the Dervish , who , being sent for by a king who had injured his health by continual indulgence , gave him a racket-ball , which he informed the king possessed wonderful medicinal virtues ; with this ball his majesty was to play at racket two or three hours every day with his courtiers .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 21]: The exercise it induced , which was the only medicinal virtue the ball possessed , restored the king to health .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 41]: So it is with all watering places ; it is not so much the use of the water , as the abstinence from what is pernicious , together with exercise and early hours , which effect the majority of cures .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 25]: We arrived first at the blue sulphur springs , and I remained there for one day to get rid of the dust of travelling .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 62]: They have a very excellent hotel there , with a ball room , which is open till eleven o'clock every night ; the scenery is very pretty , and the company was good -- as indeed is the company at all these springs , for they are too distant , and the travelling too expensive for every body to get there .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 23]: But the blue sulphur are not fashionable , and the consequence was , we were not crowded , and were very comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 26]: People who can not get accommodated at the white sulphur , remain here until they can , the distance between those being only twenty-two miles .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 29]: The only springs which are fashionable are the white sulphur , and as these springs are a feature in American society , I shall describe them more particularly .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 60]: They are situated in a small valley , many hundred feet above the level of the sea , and are of about fifteen or twenty acres in area , surrounded by small hills , covered with foliage to their summits : at one end of the Valley is the hotel , with the large dining-room for all the visitors .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 57]: Close to the hotel , but in another building , in the ballroom , and a little below the hotel on the other side , is the spring itself ; but beautiful as is the whole scenery , the great charm of this watering place is , the way in which those live who visit it .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 41]: The rises of the hills which surround the valley are covered with little cottages , log-houses , and other picturesque buildings , sometimes in rows , and ornamented with verandahs , without a second storey above ; or kitchen below .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 52]: Some are very elegant and more commodious than the rest , having been built by gentlemen who have the right given to them by the company to whom the springs belong , of occupying themselves when there , but not of preventing others from taking possession of them in their absence .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 38]: The dinners and other meals are , generally speaking , bad ; not that there is not a plentiful supply , but that it is so difficult to supply seven hundred people sitting down in one room .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 71]: In the morning , they all turn out from their little burrows , meet in the public walks , and go down to the spring before breakfast ; during the forenoon , when it is too warm , they remain at home ; after dinner , they ride out or pay visits , and then end the day , either at the ball-room or in little societies among one another .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 24]: There is no want of handsome equipages , many four in hand -LRB- Virginny long tails -RRB- and every accommodation for these equipages .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 26]: The crowd is very great , and it is astonishing what inconvenience people will submit to , rather than not be accommodated somehow or another .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 8]: Every cabin is like a rabbit burrow .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 46]: In the one next to where I was lodged , in a room about fourteen feet square , and partitioned off as well as it could be , there slept a gentleman and his wife , his sister and brother , and a female servant .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 30]: I am not sure that the nigger was not under the bed -- at all events , the young sister told me that it was not at all pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 61]: There is a sort of major-domo here who regulates every department : his word is law , and his fiat immoveable , and he presumes not a little upon his power ; a circumstance not to be surprised at , as he is as much courted and is as despotic as all the lady patronesses of Almacks rolled into one .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 9]: He is called the Metternich of the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 27]: No one is allowed accommodation at these springs who is not known , and generally speaking , only those favourites who travel in their private carriages .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 29]: It is at this place that you feel how excessively aristocratical and exclusive the Americans would be , and indeed will be , in spite of their institutions .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 43]: Spa , in its palmiest days , when princes had to sleep in their carriages at the doors of the hotels , was not more in vogue than are these white sulphur springs with the _ elite _ of the United States .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 36]: And it is here , and here only , in the States , that you do meet with what may be fairly considered as select society , for at Washington there is a great mixture .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 37]: Of course , all the celebrated belles of the different States are to be met with here , as well as all the large fortunes , nor is there a scarcity of pretty and wealthy widows .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 103]: The president , Mrs Caton , the mother of Lady Wellesley , Lady Strafford , and Lady Caermarthen , the daughter of Carrol , of Carroltown , one of the real aristocracy of America , and a signer of the Declaration of Independence , and all the first old Virginian and Carolina families , many of them descendants of the old cavaliers , were at the springs when I arrived there ; and I certainly must say that I never was at any watering-place in England where the company was so good and so select as at the Virginia springs in America .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 31]: I passed many pleasant days at this beautiful spot , and was almost as unwilling to leave it as I was to part with the Sioux Indians at St Peters .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 7]: Refinement and simplicity are equally charming .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 41]: I was introduced to a very beautiful girl here , whom I should not have mentioned so particularly , had it not been that she was the first and only lady in America that I observed to _ whittle _ .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 43]: She was sitting one fine morning on a wooden bench , surrounded by admirers , and as she carved away her seat with her pen-knife , so did she cut deep into the hearts of those who listened to her lively conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 21]: There are , as may be supposed , a large number of negro servants here attending their masters and mistresses .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 29]: I have often been amused , not only here , but during my residence in Kentucky , at the high-sounding Christian names which have been given to them .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 11]: `` Byron , tell Ada to come here directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 29]: `` Now , _ Telemachus _ , if you do n't leave _ Calypso _ alone , you 'll get a taste of the _ cow-hide _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 30]: Among others , attracted to the springs professionally , was a very clever German painter , who , like all Germans , had a very correct ear for music .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 43]: He had painted a kitchen-dance in Old Virginia , and in the picture he had introduced all the well-known coloured people in the place ; among the rest were the band of musicians , but I observed that one man was missing .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 10]: `` Why did you not put him in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 26]: inquired I. `` Why , Sir , I could not put him in ; it was impossible ; he never _ plays in tune _ .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 23]: Why , if I put him in , Sir , he would spoil the _ harmony _ of my whole picture ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 11]: I asked this artist how he got on in America .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 16]: He replied , `` But so-so : the Americans in general do not estimate genius .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 18]: They come to me and ask what I want for my pictures , and I tell them .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 16]: Then they say , ` How long did it take you to paint it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 9]: I answer , ` So many days . '
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 56]: Well , then they calculate and say , ` If it took you only so many days , you ask so many dollars a day for your work ; you ask a great deal too much ; you ought to be content with so much per day , and I will give you that . '
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 18]: So that , thought I , invention and years of study go for nothing with these people .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 32]: There is only one way to dispose of a picture in America , and that is , to raffle it ; the Americans will then run the chance of getting it .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 48]: If you do not like to part with your pictures in that way , you must paint portraits ; people will purchase their own faces all over the world : the worst of it is , that in this country , they will purchase nothing else . ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 48]: During my stay here , I was told of one of the most remarkable instances that perhaps ever occurred , of the discovery of a fact by the party from whom it was of the utmost importance to conceal it -- a very pretty interesting young widow .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 31]: She had married a promising young man , to whom she was tenderly attached , and who , a few months after the marriage , unfortunately fell in a duel .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 62]: Aware that the knowledge of the cause of her husband 's death would render the blow still more severe to her , -LRB- the ball having passed through the eye into his brain , and there being no evident gun-shot wound , -RRB- her relations informed her that he had been thrown from his horse , and killed by the fall .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 4]: She believed them .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 39]: She was living in the country , when , about nine months after her widowhood , her brother rode down to see her , and as soon as he arrived went into his room to shave and dress .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 28]: The window of his room , which was on the ground-floor , looked out upon the garden , and it being summer time , it was open .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 14]: He tore off a portion of an old newspaper to wipe his razor .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 28]: The breeze caught it , and carried it away into the garden until it stopped at the feet of his sister , who happened to be walking .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 20]: Mechanically she took up the fragment , and perceiving her husband 's name upon it , she read it .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 15]: It contained a full account of the duel in which he lost his life !
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 17]: The shock she received was so great that it unsettled her mind for nearly two years .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 23]: She had but just recovered , and for the first time re-appeared in public , when she was pointed out to me .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 33]: Returning to Guyandotte , one of the travellers wished to see the view from the Hawk 's Nest , or rather wished to be able to say that he had seen it .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 33]: We passed the spot when it was quite dark , but he persisted in going there , and , to help his vision , borrowed one of the coach-lamps from the driver .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 28]: He returned , and declared that with the assistance of the lamp he had had a very excellent view , down a precipice of several hundred feet .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 14]: His bird 's - eye view by candle-light must have been very extensive .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 53]: After all , it is but to be able to say that they had been , to such a place , or have seen such a thing , that , more than any real taste for it , induces the majority of the world to incur the trouble and fatigue of travelling .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 40]: I was informed that a camp-meeting was to be held about seven miles from Cincinnati , and , anxious to verify the accounts I had heard of them , I availed myself of this opportunity of deciding for myself .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 51]: We proceeded about five miles on the high road , and then diverged by a cross-road until we arrived at a steep conical hill , crowned with splendid forest trees without underwood ; the trees being sufficiently apart to admit of wagons and other vehicles to pass in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 19]: The camp was raised upon the summit of this hill , a piece of table-land comprising many acres .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 43]: About an acre and a half was surrounded on the four sides by cabins built up of rough boards ; the whole area in the centre was fitted up with planks , laid about a foot from the ground , as seats .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 42]: At one end , but not close to the cabins , was a raised stand , which served as a pulpit for the preachers , one of them praying , while five or six others sat down behind him on benches .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 61]: There was ingress to the area by the four corners ; the whole of it was shaded by vast forest trees , which ran up to the height of fifty or sixty feet without throwing out a branch ; and to the trunks of these trees were fixed lamps in every direction , for the continuance of service by night .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 36]: Outside the area , which may be designated as the church , were hundreds of tents pitched in every quarter , their snowy whiteness contrasting beautifully with the deep verdure and gloom of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 44]: These were the temporary habitations of those who had come many miles to attend the meeting , and who remained there from the commencement until it concluded -- usually , a period of from ten to twelve days , but often much longer .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 46]: The tents were furnished with every article necessary for cooking ; mattresses to sleep upon , etcetera ; some of them even had bedsteads and chests of drawers , which had been brought in the wagons in which the people in this country usually travel .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 36]: At a farther distance were all the wagons and other vehicles which had conveyed the people to the meeting , whilst hundreds of horses were tethered under the trees , and plentifully provided with forage .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 13]: Such were the general outlines of a most interesting and beautiful scene .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 29]: Where , indeed , could so magnificent a temple to the Lord be raised as on this lofty hill , crowned as it was with such majestic verdure .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 32]: Compared with these giants of the forest , the cabins and tents of the multitude appeared as insignificant and contemptible as almost would man himself in the presence of the Deity .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 61]: Many generations of men must have been mowed down before the arrival of these enormous trees to their present state of maturity ; and at the time they sent forth their first shoots , probably were not on the whole of this continent , now teeming with millions , as many white men as are now assembled on this field .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 25]: I walked about for some time surveying the panorama , when I returned to the area , and took my seat upon a bench .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 31]: In one quarter the coloured population had collected themselves ; their tents appeared to be better furnished and better supplied with comforts than most of those belonging to the whites .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 27]: I put my head into one of the tents , and discovered a sable damsel lying on a bed and singing hymns in a loud voice .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 14]: The major portion of those not in the area were cooking the dinners .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 27]: Fires were burning in every direction , pots boiling , chickens roasting , hams seething ; indeed there appeared to be no want of creature comforts .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 32]: But the trumpet sounded , as in days of yore , as a signal that the service was about to recommence and I went into the area and took my seat .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 26]: One of the preachers rose and gave out a hymn , which was sung by the congregation , amounting to about seven or eight hundred .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 49]: After the singing of the hymn was concluded he commenced an extempore sermon : it was good , sound doctrine , and , although Methodism of the mildest tone , and divested of its bitterness of denunciation , as indeed is generally the case with Methodism in America .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 45]: I heard nothing which could be offensive to any other sect , or which could be considered objectionable by the most orthodox , and I began to doubt whether such scenes as had been described to me did really take place at these meetings .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 35]: A prayer followed , and after about two hours the congregation were dismissed to their dinners , being first informed that the service would recommence at two o'clock at the sound of the trumpet .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 77]: In front of the pulpit there was a space railed off ; and strewed with straw , which I was told was the _ Anxious seat _ , and on which sat those who were touched by their consciences or the discourse of the preacher ; but , although there were several sitting on it , I did not perceive any emotion on the part of the occupants : they were attentive , but nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 28]: When I first examined the area , I saw a very large tent at one corner of it , probably fifty feet long , by twenty wide .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 33]: It was open at the end , and , being full of straw , I concluded it was used as a sleeping-place for those who had not provided themselves with separate accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 22]: About an hour after the service was over , perceiving many people directing their steps toward it , I followed them .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 57]: On one side of the tent were about twenty females , mostly young , squatted down on the straw ; on the other a few men ; in the centre was a long form , against which were some other men kneeling , with their faces covered with their hands , as if occupied in prayer .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 24]: Gradually the numbers increased , girl after girl dropped down upon the straw on the one side , and men on the other .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 90]: At last an elderly man gave out a hymn , which was sung with peculiar energy ; then another knelt down in the centre , and commenced a prayer , shutting his eyes -LRB- as I observed most clergymen in the United States do when they pray -RRB- and raising his hands above his head ; then another burst out into a prayer , and another followed him ; then their voices became all confused together ; and then were heard the more silvery tones of woman 's supplication .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 25]: As the din increased so did their enthusiasm ; handkerchiefs were raised to bright eyes , and sobs were intermingled with prayers and ejaculations .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 34]: It became a scene of Babel ; more than twenty men and women were crying out at the highest pitch of their voices , and trying apparently to be heard above the others .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 47]: Every minute the excitement increased ; some wrung their hands and called for mercy ; some tore their hair ; boys laid down crying bitterly , with their heads buried in the straw ; there was sobbing almost to suffocation , and hysterics and deep agony .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 22]: One young man clung to the form , crying , `` Satan tears at me , but I would hold fast .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 10]: Help -- help , he drags me down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 52]: It was a scene of horrible agony and despair ; and , when it was at its height , one of the preachers came in , and raising his voice high above the tumult , intreated the Lord to receive into his fold those who now repented and would fain return .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 52]: Another of the ministers knelt down by some young men , whose faces were covered up , and who appeared to be almost in a state of frenzy ; and putting his hands upon them , poured forth an energetic prayer , well calculated to work upon their over excited feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 44]: Groans , ejaculations , broken sobs , frantic motions , and convulsions succeeded ; some fell on their backs with their eyes closed , waving their hands with a slow motion , and crying out -- `` Glory , glory , glory ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 22]: I quitted the spot , and hastened away into the forest , for the sight was too painful , too melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 20]: Its sincerity could not be doubted , but it was the effect of over-excitement , not of sober reasoning .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 16]: Could such violence of feeling have been produced had each party retired to commune alone ?
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 4]: most surely not .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 27]: It was a fever created by collision and contact , of the same nature as that which stimulates a mob to deeds of blood and horror .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 7]: Gregarious animals are by nature inoffensive .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 26]: The cruel and the savage live apart , and in solitude ; but the gregarious , upheld and stimulated by each other , become formidable .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 6]: So it is with man .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 28]: I was told that the scene would be much more interesting and exciting after the lamps were lighted ; but I had seen quite enough of it .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 20]: It was too serious to laugh at , and I felt that it was not for me to condemn .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 37]: `` Cry aloud , and spare not , '' was the exhortation of the preacher and certainly , if heaven was only to be taken by storm , he was a proper leader for his congregation .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 36]: Whatever may be the opinion of the reader as to the meeting which I have described , it is certain that nothing could be more laudable than the intention by which these meetings were originated .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 31]: At the first settling of the country the people were widely scattered , and the truths of the Gospel , owing to the scarcity of preachers , but seldom heard .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 44]: It was to remedy this unavoidable evil that they agreed , like the Christians in earlier times , to collect together from all quarters , and pass many days in meditation and prayer , `` exhorting one another -- comforting one another . ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 91]: Even now it is not uncommon for the settlers in Indians and Illinois to travel one hundred miles in their wagons to attend one of these meetings , -- meetings which are now too often sullied by fanaticism on the one hand , and on the other by the levity and infidelity of those who go not to pray , but to scoff ; or to indulge in the licentiousness which , it is said , but too often follows , when night has thrown her veil over the scene .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 20]: Lexington , the capital of the State , is embosomed in the very heart of the vale of Kentucky .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 48]: This vale was the favourite hunting-ground of the Indians ; and a fairer country for the chase could not well be imagined than this rolling , well-wooded , luxuriant valley , extending from hill to hill , from dale to dale , for so many long miles .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 57]: No wonder that the Indians fought so hard to retain , or the Virginians to acquire it ; nor was it until much blood had saturated the ground , many reeking scalps had been torn from the head , and many a mother and her children murdered at their hearths , that the contest was relinquished .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 19]: So severe were the struggles , that the ground obtained the name of the `` Bloody Ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 24]: But the strife is over ; the red man has been exterminated , and peace and plenty now reign over this smiling country .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 20]: It is indeed a beautiful and bounteous land ; on the whole , the most eligible in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 46]: The valley is seven hundred and fifty feet above the level of the sea , and , therefore , not so subject to fevers as the States of Indiana and Illinois , and indeed that portion of its own state which borders on the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 23]: But all the rest of the Kentucky land is by no means equal in richness of soil to that of this valley .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 38]: There are about ninety counties in the State , of which about thirty are of rich land ; but four of them , namely , Fayette , Bourbon , Scotts , and Woodford , are the finest .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 40]: The whole of these four counties are held by large proprietors , who graze and breed stock to a very great extent , supplying the whole of the Western States with the best description of every kind of cattle .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 22]: Cattle-shows are held every year , and high prizes awarded to the owners of the finest beasts which are there produced .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 45]: The State of Kentucky , as well as Virginia , is in fact an agricultural and grazing State ; the pasture is very rich , and studded with oak and other timber , as in the manner I have described in Ioway and Wisconsin .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 30]: The staples of Kentucky are hemp and mules ; the latter are in such demand for the south that they can hardly produce them fast enough for the market .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 34]: The minimum price of a three-year old mule is about eighty dollars ; the maximum usually one hundred and sixty dollars , or thirty-five pounds , but they often fetch much higher prices .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 30]: I saw a pair in harness , well matched , and about seventeen hands high , for which they refused one thousand dollars -- upwards of two hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 10]: The cattle-show took place when I was at Lexington .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 23]: That of horned beasts I was too late for ; but the second day I went to the exhibition of thorough-bred horses .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 23]: The premiums were for the best two-year old , yearlings , and colts , and many of them were very fine animals .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 50]: The third day was for the exhibition of mules ; which , on account of size there being a great desideratum , are bred only from mares ; the full-grown averaged from fifteen to sixteen hands high , but they have often been known to be seventeen hands high .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 30]: I had seen them quite as large in a nobleman 's carriage in the south of Spain ; but then they were considered rare , and of great value .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 31]: After all the other varieties of age had made their appearance , and the judges had given their decision , the mules foaled down this year were to be examined .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 58]: As they were still sucking , it was necessary that the brood mares should be led into the enclosed paddock , where the animals were inspected , that the foals might be induced to follow ; as soon as they were all in the enclosure the mares were sent out , leaving all the foals by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 25]: At first they commenced a concert of wailing after their mothers , and then turned their lamentations into indignation and revenge upon each other .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 32]: Such a ridiculous scene of kicking took place as I never before witnessed , about thirty of them being most sedulously engaged in the occupation , all at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 59]: I never saw such ill-behaved mules ; it was quite impossible for the judges to decide upon the prize , for you could see nothing but heels in the air ; it was rap , rap , rap , incessantly against one another 's sides , until they were all turned out , and the show was over .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 21]: I rather think the prize must , in this instance , have been awarded to the one that kicked highest .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 33]: The fourth day was for the exhibition of jackasses , of two-year and one-year , and for foals , and jennies also ; this sight was to me one of peculiar interest .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 39]: Accustomed as we are in England to value a jackass at thirty shillings , we look down upon them with contempt ; but here the case is reversed : you look up at them with surprise and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 36]: Several were shown standing fifteen hands high , with head and ears in proportion ; the breed has been obtained from the Maltese jackass , crossed by those of Spain and the south of France .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 34]: Those imported seldom average more than fourteen hands high ; but the Kentuckians , by great attention and care , have raised them up to fifteen hands , and sometimes even to sixteen .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 24]: But the price paid for these splendid animals , for such they really were , will prove how much they are in request .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 19]: Warrior , a jackass of great celebrity , sold for 5,000 dollars , upwards of 1,000 pounds sterling .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 15]: Half of another jackass , Benjamin by name , was sold for 2,500 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 44]: At the show I asked a gentleman what he wanted for a very beautiful female ass , only one year old ; he said that he could have 1,000 dollars , 250 pounds for her , but that he had refused that sum .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 21]: For a two-year old jack , shown during the exhibition , they asked 3000 dollars , more than 600 pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 34]: I never felt such respect for donkeys before ; but the fact is , that mule-breeding is so lucrative , that there is no price which a very large donkey will not command .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 15]: I afterwards went to a cattle sale a few miles out of the town .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 27]: Don Juan , a two-year old bull , Durham breed , fetched 1,075 dollars ; an imported Durham cow , with her calf , 985 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 19]: Before I arrived , a bull and cow fetched 1,300 dollars each of them , about 280 pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 34]: The cause of this is , that the demand for good stock , now that the Western States are filling up , becomes so great that they can not be produced fast enough .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 35]: Mr Clay , who resides near Lexington , is one of the best breeders in the State , which is much indebted to him for the fine stock which he has imported from England .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 27]: Another sale took place , which I attended , and I quote the prices : -- Yearling bull , 1,000 dollars ; ditto heifer , 1,500 .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 20]: Cows , of full Durham blood , but bred in Kentucky , 1,245 dollars ; ditto , 1,235 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 8]: Imported cow and calf , 2,100 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 53]: It must be considered , that although a good Durham cow will not cost more than twenty guineas perhaps , in England , the expenses of transport are very great , and they generally stand it to the importers , about 600 dollars , before they arrive at the State of Kentucky .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 36]: But to prove that the Kentuckians are fully justified in giving the prices they do , I will shew what was the profit made upon an old cow before she was sold for 400 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 18]: I had a statement from her proprietor , who had her in his possession for nine years .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 78]: She was a full-bred cow , and during the time that he had held her in his possession , she had cleared him 15,000 dollars by the sale of her progeny : As follows : -- Total , 24 averaging 625 dollars a head , which is by no means a large price , as the two cows , which sold at the sale for 1,245 , and 1,235 dollars , were a part of her issue .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 27]: Lexington is a very pretty town , with very pleasant society , and afforded me great relief after the unpleasant sojourn I had had at Louisville .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 35]: Conversing one day with Mr Clay , I had another instance given me of the mischief which the conduct of Miss Martineau has entailed upon all those English who may happen to visit America .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 97]: Mr Clay observed that Miss Martineau had remained with him for some time , and that during her stay , she had professed very different , or at least more modified opinions on the subject of slavery , than those she has expressed in her book : so much so , that one day , having read a letter from Boston cautioning her against being cajoled by the hospitality and pleasant society of the Western States , she handed it to him , saying , `` They want to make a regular abolitionist of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 52]: `` When her work came out , '' continued Mr Clay , `` although I read but very little of it , I turned to this subject so important with us , and I must say I was a little surprised to find that she had so changed her opinions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 21]: The fact is , Miss Martineau appears to have been what the Kentuckians call , `` playing ` possum . ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 36]: I have met with some of the Southern ladies whose conversations on slavery are said , or supposed , to have been those printed by Miss Martineau , and they deny that they are correct .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 79]: That the Southern ladies are very apt to express great horror at living too long a time at the plantations , is very certain ; not , however , because they expect to be murdered in their beds by the slaves , as they tell their husbands , but because they are anxious to spend more of their time at the cities , where they can enjoy more luxury and amusement than can be procured at the plantations .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 59]: Every body rides in Virginia and Kentucky , master , man , woman , and slave , and they all ride well : it is quite as common to meet a woman on horseback as a man , and it is a pretty sight in their States to walk by the Church doors and see them all arrive .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 21]: The Churches have stables , or rather sheds , built close to them , for the accommodation of the cattle .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 10]: Elopements in these States are all made on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 16]: The goal to be obtained is to cross to the other side of the Ohio .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 21]: The consequence is that it is a regular steeple-chase ; the young couple clearing everything , father and brothers following .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 28]: Whether it is that , having the choice , the young people are the best mounted , I know not , but the runaways are seldom overtaken .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 24]: One couple crossed the Ohio when I was at Cincinnati , and had just time to tie the noose before their pursuers arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 45]: At Lexington , on Sunday , there is not a carriage or horse to be obtained by a white man for any consideration , they having all been regularly engaged for that day by the negro slaves , who go out in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 23]: Where they get the money I do not know ; but certain it is , that it is always produced when required .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 42]: I was waiting at the counter of a sort of pastry-cook 's , when three negro lads , about twelve or fourteen years old , came in , and , in a most authoritative tone , ordered three glasses of soda-water .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 4]: Returned to Louisville .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 7]: VOLUME TWO , CHAPTER THIRTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 17]: There is one great inconvenience in American travelling , arising from the uncertainty of river navigation .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 44]: Excepting the Lower Mississippi and the Hudson , and not always the latter , the communication by water is obstructed during a considerable portion of the year , by ice in the winter , or a deficiency of water in the dry season .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 35]: This has been a remarkable season for heat and drought ; and thousands of people remain in the States of Ohio , Virginia , and Kentucky , who are most anxious to return home .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 61]: It must be understood , that during the unhealthy season in the southern States on the Mississippi , the planters , cotton-growers , slave holders , store-keepers , and indeed almost every class , excepting the slaves and overseers , migrate to the northward , to escape the yellow fever , and spend a portion of their gains in amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 58]: They go to Cincinnati and the towns of Ohio , to the Lakes occasionally , but principally to the cities and watering places of Virginia and Kentucky , more especially Louisville , where I now am ; and Louisville , being also the sort of general rendezvous for departure south , is now crammed with southern people .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 38]: The steam boats can not run , for the river is almost dry ; and I -LRB- as well as others -RRB- have been detained much longer on the banks of the Ohio than was my intention .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 41]: There is land-carriage certainly , but the heat of the weather is so overpowering that even the Southerns dread it ; and in consequence of this extreme heat the sickness in these western States has been much greater than usual .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 27]: Even Kentucky , especially that part which borders on the Mississippi , which , generally speaking , is healthy , is now suffering under malignant fevers .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 75]: I may here remark , that the two States , Illinois and Indiana , and the western portions of Kentucky and Tennessee , are very unhealthy ; not a year passes without a great mortality from the bilious congestive fever , a variety of the yellow fever , and the ague ; more especially Illinois and Indiana , with the western portion of Ohio , which is equally flat with the other two States .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 46]: The two States of Indiana and Illinois lie , as it were , at the bottom of the western basin ; the soil is wonderfully rich , but the drainage is insufficient , as may be seen from the sluggishness with which these rivers flow .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 64]: Many and many thousands of poor Irish emigrants , and settlers also , have been struck down by disease , never to rise again , in these rich but unhealthy States ; to which , stimulated by the works published by land-speculators , thousands and thousands every year repair , and , notwithstanding the annual expenditure of life , rapidly increase the population .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 42]: I had made up my mind to travel by land-carriage to St Louis , Missouri , through the States of Indiana and Illinois , but two American gentlemen , who had just arrived by that route , succeeded in dissuading me .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 7]: They had come over on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 9]: They described the disease and mortality as dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 54]: That sometimes , when they wished to put up their horses at seven or eight o'clock in the evening , they were compelled to travel on till twelve or one o'clock before they could gain admittance , some portion in every house suffering under the bilious fever , tertian ague , or flux .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 8]: They described the scene as quite appalling .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 52]: At some houses there was not one person able to rise and attend upon the others ; all were dying or dead and to increase the misery of their situations , the springs had dried up , and in many places they could not procure water except by sending many miles .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 29]: A friend of mine , who had been on a mission through the portion of Kentucky and Tennessee bordering on them Mississippi , made a very similar statement .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 25]: He was not refused to remain where he stopped , but he could procure no assistance , and everywhere ran the risk of contagion .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 25]: He said that some of the people were obliged to send their negroes with a waggon upwards of fifteen miles to wash their clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 82]: That this has been a very unhealthy season is certain , but still , from all the information I could obtain , there is a great mortality every year in the districts I have pointed out ; and such indeed must be the case , from the miasma created every fall of the year in these rich alluvial soils , some portions of which have been worked for fifty years without the assistance of manure , and still yield abundant crops .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 18]: It will be a long while before the drainage necessary to render them healthy can be accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 61]: The sickly appearance of the inhabitants establishes but too well the facts related to me ; and yet , strange to say , it would appear to be a provision of Providence , that a remarkable fecundity on the part of the women in the more healthy portions of their Western States , should meet the annual expenditure of life .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 26]: Three children at a birth are more common here than twins are in England ; and they , generally speaking , are all reared up .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 9]: There have been many instances of even four .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 49]: The western valley of America , of which the Mississippi may be considered as the common drain , must , from the surprising depth of the alluvial soil , have been -LRB- ages back -RRB- wholly under water , and , perhaps , by some convulsion raised up .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 16]: What insects are we in our own estimation when we meditate upon such stupendous changes .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 32]: Since I have been in these States , I have been surprised at the stream of emigration which appears to flow from North Carolina to Indiana , Illinois , and Missouri .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 16]: Every hour you meet with a caravan of emigrants from that sterile but healthy state .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 57]: Every night the banks of the Ohio are lighted up with their fires , where they have bivouacked previously to crossing the river ; but they are not like the poor German or Irish settlers : they are well prepared , and have nothing to do , apparently , but to sit down upon their land .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 77]: These caravans consist of two or three covered wagons , full of women and children , furniture , and other necessaries , each drawn by a team of horses ; brood mares , with foals by their sides , following ; half a dozen or more cows , flanked on each side by the men , with their long rifles on their shoulders ; sometimes a boy or two , or a half-grown girl on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 36]: Occasionally they wear an appearance of more refinement and cultivation , as well as wealth , the principals travelling in a sort of worn-out old carriage , the remains of the competence of former days .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 50]: I often surmised , as they travelled cheerfully along , saluting me as they passed by , whether they would not repent their decision , and sigh for their pine barrens and heath , after they had discovered that with fertility they had to encounter such disease and mortality .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 15]: I have often heard it asserted by Englishmen , that America has no coal .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 22]: There never was a greater mistake : she has an abundance , and of the very finest that ever was seen .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 34]: At Wheeling and Pittsburg , and on all the borders of the Ohio river above Guyandotte , they have an inexhaustible supply , equal to the very best offered to the London market .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 15]: All the spurs of the Alleghany range appear to be one mass of coal .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 19]: In the Eastern States the coal is of a different quality , although there is some very tolerable .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 12]: The anthracite is bad , throwing out a strong sulphureous gas .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 21]: The fact is that wood is at present cheaper than coal , and therefore the latter is not in demand .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 60]: An American told me one day , that a company had been working a coal mine in an Eastern State , which proved to be of a very bad quality ; they had sent some to an influential person as a present , requesting him to give his opinion of it , as that would be important to them .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 84]: After a certain time he forwarded to them a certificate couched in such terms as these : -- `` I do hereby certify that I have tried the coal sent me by the company at -- , and it is my decided opinion , that when the general conflagration of the world shall take place , any man who will take his position on that _ coal-mine _ will certainly be the _ last man _ who will be _ burnt _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 17]: I had to travel by coach for six days and nights , to arrive at Baltimore .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 45]: As it may be supposed , I was not a little tired before my journey was half over ; I therefore was glad when the coach stopped for a few hours , to throw off my coat , and lie down on a bed .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 84]: At one town , where I had stopped , I had been reposing more than two hours when my door was opened -- but this was too common a circumstance for me to think any thing of it ; the people would come into my room whether I was in bed or out of bed , dressed or not dressed , and if I expostulated , they would reply , `` Never mind , _ we _ do n't care , Captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 16]: On this occasion I called out , `` Well , what do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 8]: `` Are you Captain M -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 13]: said the person walking up to the bed where I was lying .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 30]: `` Yes , I am , '' replied I. `` Well , I reckon I would n't allow you to go through our town without seeing you any how .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 16]: Of all the humans , you 're the one I most wish to see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 8]: I told him I was highly flattered .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 50]: `` Well now , '' said he , giving a jump , and coming down right upon the bed in his great coat , `` I 'll just tell you ; I said to the chap at the bar , ` Ai n't the Captain in your house ? '
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' says he .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 7]: ` Then where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 43]: says I. ` Oh , ' says he , ` he 's gone into his own room , and locked himself up ; he 's a d -- d aristocrat , and wo n't drink at the bar with other gentlemen . '
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 48]: So , thought I , I 've read M -- 's works , and I 'll be swamped if he is an aristocrat , and by the ` tarnal I 'll go up and see ; so here I am , and you 're no aristocrat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 22]: `` I should think not , '' replied I , moving my feet away , which he was half sitting on .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 18]: `` Oh , do n't move ; never mind me , Captain , I 'm quite comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 11]: And how do you find yourself by this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 14]: `` Very tired indeed , '' replied I. `` I suspicion as much .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 34]: Now , d'ye see , I left four or five good fellows down below who wish to see you ; I said I 'd go up first , and come down to them .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 25]: The fact is , Captain , we do n't like you should pass through our town without showing you a little American hospitality . ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 16]: So saying , he slid off the bed , and went out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 35]: In a minute he returned , bringing with him four or five others , all of whom he introduced by name , and reseated himself on my bed , while the others took chairs .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 44]: `` Now , gentlemen , '' said he , `` as I was telling the Captain , we wish to show him a little American hospitality ; what shall it be , gentlemen ; what d'ye say -- a bottle of Madeira ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 35]: An immediate answer not being returned , he continued : `` Yes , gentlemen , a bottle of Madeira ; at my expense , gentlemen , recollect that ; now ring the bell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 36]: `` I shall be most happy to take a glass of wine with you , '' observed I , `` but in my own room the wine must be at _ my _ expense . ''
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 65]: `` At _ your _ expense , Captain ; well , if it must be , I do n't care ; at _ your _ expense then , Captain , if you say so ; only , you see , we must show you a little American hospitality , as I said to them all down below ; did n't I , gentlemen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 50]: The wine was ordered , and it ended in my hospitable friends drinking three bottles , and then they all shook hands with me , declaring how happy they should be if I came to the town again , allowed them to show me a little more American hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 42]: There was something so very ridiculous in this event , that I can not help narrating it ; but let it not be supposed , for a moment , that I intend it as a sarcasm upon American hospitality in general .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 43]: There certainly are conditions usually attached to their hospitality , if you wish to profit by it to any extent ; and one is , that you do not venture to find fault with themselves , their manners , or their institutions .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 38]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ _ Note _ -- That a guest , partaking of their hospitality , should give his opinions unasked , and find fault , would be in very bad taste , to say the least of it .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 45]: But the fault in America is , that you are compelled to give an opinion , and you can not escape by a doubtful reply : as the American said to me in Philadelphia , `` I wish a _ categorical _ answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 30]: Thus , should you not agree with them , you are placed upon the horns of a dilemma : either you must affront the company , or sacrifice truth .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 4]: END OF DIARY .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 7]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 4]: REMARKS -- LANGUAGE .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 33]: The Americans boldly assert that they speak better English than we do , and I was rather surprised not to find a statistical table to that effect in Mr Carey 's publication .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 50]: What I believe the Americans would imply by the above assertion is that you may travel through all the United States and find less difficulty in understanding or being understood , than in some of the counties of England , such as Cornwall , Devonshire , Lancashire and Suffolk .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 24]: So far they are correct ; but it is remarkable how very debased the language has become in a short period in America .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 14]: There are few provincial dialects in England much less intelligible than the following .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 21]: A Yankee girl , who wished to hire herself out , was asked if the had any followers or sweethearts ?
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 39]: After a little hesitation , she replied , `` Well , now , ca n't exactly say ; I bees a sorter courted and a sorter not ; reckon more a sorter yes than a sorter no . ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 30]: In many points the Americans have to a certain degree obtained that equality which they profess ; and , as respects their language , it certainly is the case .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 38]: If their lower classes are more intelligible than ours , it is equally true that the higher classes do not speak the language so purely or so classically as it is spoken among the well educated English .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 64]: The peculiar dialect of the English counties is kept up because we are a settled country ; the people who are born in a county live in it , and die in it , transmitting their sites of labour or of amusement to their descendants , generation after generation , without change : consequently , the provincialisms of the language become equally hereditary .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 36]: Now , in America , they have a dictionary containing many thousands of words , which , with us , are either obsolete or are provincialisms , or are words necessarily invented by the Americans .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 27]: When the people of England emigrated to the states , they came from every county in England , and each county brought its provincialisms with it .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 21]: These were admitted into the general stock ; and were since all collected and bound up by one Mr Webster .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 55]: With the exception of a few words coined for local uses -LRB- such as _ snags _ and _ sawyers _ , on the Mississippi , -RRB- I do not recollect a word which I have not traced to be either a provincialism of some English county , or else to be obsolete English .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 23]: There are a few from the Dutch , such as _ stoup _ , for the porch of a door , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 53]: I was once talking with an American about Webster 's dictionary , and he observed , `` Well now , sir , I understand it 's the only one used in the Court of St James , by the king , queen , and princesses , and that by royal order . ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 44]: The upper class of the Americans do not , however , speak or pronounce English according to our standard ; they appear to have no exact rule to guide them , probably from the want of any intimate knowledge of Greek or Latin .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 21]: You seldom hear a derivation from the Greek pronounced correctly , the accent being generally laid upon the wrong syllable .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 17]: In fact , every one appears to be independent , and pronounces just as he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 22]: But it is not for me to decide the very momentous question , as to which nation speaks the best English .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 19]: The Americans generally improve upon the inventions of others ; probably they may have improved upon our language .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 104]: I recollect some one observing how very superior the German language was to the English , from their possessing so many compound substantives and adjectives ; whereupon his friend replied , that it was just as easy for us to possess them in England if we pleased , and gave us as an example an observation made by his old dame at Eaton , who declared that young Paulet was , without any exception , the most _ good-for-nothing-est _ , the most _ provoking-people-est _ , and the most _ poke-about-every-corner-est _ boy she had ever had charge of in her life .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 94]: Assuming this principle of improvement to be correct , it must be acknowledged that the Americans have added considerably to our dictionary ; but , as I have before observed , this being a point of too much delicacy for me to decide upon , I shall just submit to the reader the occasional variations , or improvements , as they may be , which met my ears during my residence in America , as also the idiomatic peculiarities , and having so done , I must leave him to decide for himself .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 76]: I recollect once talking with one of the first men in America , who was narrating to me the advantages which might have accrued to him if he had followed up a certain speculation , when he said , `` Sir , if I had done so , I should not only have _ doubled _ and _ trebled _ , but I should have _ fourbled _ and _ fivebled _ my money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 42]: One of the members of congress once said , `` What the honourable gentleman has just asserted I consider as _ catamount _ to a denial ; '' -- -LRB- catamount is the term given to a panther or lynx . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 20]: `` I presume , '' replied his opponent , `` that the honourable gentleman means _ tantamount _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 34]: `` No , sir , I do not mean _ tantamount _ ; I am not so ignorant of our language , not to be aware that catamount and tantamount are anonymous . ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 36]: The Americans dwell upon their words when they speak -- a custom arising , I presume , from their cautious , calculating habits ; and they have always more or less of a nasal twang .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 20]: I once said to a lady , `` Why do you drawl out your words in that way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 33]: `` Well , '' replied she , `` I 'd drawl all the way from Maine to Georgia , rather than _ clip _ my words as you English people do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 49]: Many English words are used in a very different sense from that which we attach to them ; for instance : a _ clever _ person in America means an amiable , good-tempered person , and the Americans make the distinction by saying , I mean English clever .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 13]: Our _ clever _ is represented by the word _ smart _ .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 22]: The verb _ to admire _ is also used in the East , instead of the verb _ to like _ .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 9]: `` Have you ever been at Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 13]: `` No ; but I should _ admire _ to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 49]: A Yankee description of a clever woman : -- `` Well , now , she 'll walk right into you , and talk to you like a book ; '' or , as I have heard them say , `` she 'll talk you out of sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 10]: The word ugly is used for cross , ill-tempered .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 14]: `` I did feel so _ ugly _ when he said that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 37]: _ Bad _ is used in an odd sense : it is employed for awkward , uncomfortable : sorry : -- `` I did feel so _ bad _ when I read that '' -- awkward .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 16]: `` I have felt quite _ bad _ about it ever since '' -- uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 17]: `` She was so _ bad _ , I thought she would cry '' -- sorry .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 32]: And as bad is tantamount to not _ good _ , I have heard a lady say , `` I do n't feel _ at all good _ this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 7]: Mean is occasionally used for ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 11]: `` I never felt so mean in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 7]: The word handsome is oddly used .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 22]: `` We reckon this very handsome scenery , sir , '' said an American to me , pointing to the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 12]: `` I consider him very truthful , '' is another expression .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 7]: `` He stimulates too much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 6]: `` He dissipates awfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 26]: And they are very fond of using the noun as a verb , as -- `` I _ suspicion _ that 's a fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 10]: `` I _ opinion _ quite the contrary . ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 14]: The word _ considerable _ is in considerable demand in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 57]: In a work in which the letters of the party had been given to the public as specimens of good style and polite literature , it is used as follows : -- `` My dear sister , I have taken up the pen early this morning , as I intend to write _ considerable _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 9]: -LRB- Life and Remains of Charles Pont . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 11]: The word great is oddly used for fine , splendid .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 14]: `` She 's the _ greatest _ gal in the whole Union . ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 25]: But there is one word which we must surrender up to the Americans as their _ very own _ , as the children say .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 44]: I will quote a passage from one of their papers : -- `` The editor of the _ Philadelphia Gazette _ is wrong in calling absquatiated a Kentucky _ phrase _ -LRB- he may well say phrase instead of _ word _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 34]: It may prevail there , but its origin was in South Carolina , where it was a few years since regularly derived from the Latin , as we can prove from undoubted authority .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 31]: By the way , there is a little _ corruption _ is the word as the _ Gazette _ uses it , _ absquatalized _ is the true reading . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 7]: Certainly a word worth quarrelling about !
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 8]: `` Are you cold , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 17]: said I to a young lady , who pulled the shawl closer over her shoulders . ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 9]: _ Some _ , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 6]: The English _ what _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 23]: implying that you did not hear what was said to you , is changed in America to the word _ how _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 29]: `` I reckon '' , `` I calculate '' , `` I guess , '' are all used as the common English phrase , `` I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 25]: Each term is said to be peculiar to different states , but I found them used everywhere , one as often as the other .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 10]: _ I opine _ , is not so common .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 24]: A specimen of Yankee dialect and conversation : -- `` Well now , I 'll tell you -- you know Marble Head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 6]: `` Guess I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 11]: `` Well , then , you know Sally Hackett . ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 6]: `` No , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 6]: `` Not know Sally Hackett ?
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 8]: Why she lives at Marble Head . ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 7]: `` Guess I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 10]: `` You do n't mean to say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 6]: `` Yes , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 11]: `` And you really do n't know Sally Hackett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 6]: `` No , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 11]: `` I guess you 've heard talk of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 6]: `` No , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 8]: `` Well , that 's considerable odd .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 38]: Now , I 'll tell you -- Ephraim Bagg , he that has the farm three miles from Marble Head -- just as -- but now , are you sure you do n't know Sally Hackett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 6]: `` No , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 14]: `` Well , he 's a pretty substantial man , and no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 22]: He has got a heart as big as an ox , and everything else in proportion , I 've a notion .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 33]: He loves Sal , the worst kind ; and if she gets up there , she 'll think she has got to Palestine -LRB- Paradise -RRB- ; ai n't she a screamer ?
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 45]: I were thinking of Sal myself , for I feel lonesome , and when I am thrown into my store promiscuous alone , I can tell you I have the blues , the worst kind , no mistake -- I can tell you that .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 38]: I always feel a kind o ' queer when I sees Sal , but when I meet any of the other gals I am as calm and cool as the milky way , '' etcetera , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 9]: The verb `` to fix '' is universal .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 6]: It means to do anything .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 14]: `` Shall I _ fix _ your coat or your breakfast first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 20]: That is -- `` Shall I brush your coat , or _ get ready _ your breakfast first ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 15]: _ Right away _ , for immediately or at once , is very general .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 9]: `` Shall I fix it right away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 10]: -- i.e. `` Shall I do it immediately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 20]: In the West , when you stop at an inn , they say -- `` What will you have ?
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 37]: Brown meal and common doings , or white wheat and chicken _ fixings _ ; '' -- that is , `` Will you have pork and brown bread , or white bread and fried chicken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 17]: Also , `` Will you have a _ feed _ or a _ check _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 8]: -- A dinner , or a luncheon ?
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 11]: In _ full blast _ -- something in the extreme .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 24]: `` When she came to meeting , with her yellow hat and feathers , was n't she _ in fall blast _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 29]: But for more specimens of genuine Yankee , I must refer the reader to Sam Slick and Major Downing , and shall now proceed to some farther peculiarities .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 77]: There are two syllables -- um , hu -- which are very generally used by the Americans as a sort of reply , intimating that they are attentive , and that the party may proceed with his narrative ; but , by inflection and intonation , these two syllables are made to express dissent or assent , surprise , disdain , and -LRB- like Lord Burleigh 's nod in the play -RRB- a great deal more .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 39]: The reason why these two syllables have been selected is , that they can be pronounced without the trouble of opening your mouth , and you may be in a state of listlessness and repose while others talk .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 19]: I myself found them very convenient at times , and gradually got into the habit of using them .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 24]: The Americans are very local in their phrases , and borrow their similes very much from the nature of their occupations and pursuits .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 44]: If you ask a Virginian or Kentuckian where he was born , he will invariably tell you that he was _ raised _ in such a county -- the term applied to horses , and , in breeding states , to men also .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 22]: When a man is tipsy -LRB- spirits being made from grain -RRB- , they generally say he is _ corned _ .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 29]: In the West , where steam-navigation is so abundant , when they ask you to drink they say , `` Stranger , will you take in wood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 28]: -- the vessels taking in wood as fuel to keep the steam up , and the person taking in spirits to keep _ his _ steam up .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 28]: The roads in the country being cut through woods , and the stumps of the trees left standing , the carriages are often brought up by them .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 17]: Hence the expression of , `` Well , I am _ stumped _ this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 73]: I heard a young man , a farmer in Vermont , say , when talking about another having gained the heart of a pretty girl , `` Well , how he contrived to _ fork _ into her young affections , I ca n't tell ; but I 've a mind to _ put my whole team on _ , and see if I ca n't run him off the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 40]: The old phrase of `` straining at a gnat , and swallowing a camel , '' is , in the Eastern states , rendered `` straining at a _ gate _ , and swallowing a _ saw-mill _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 6]: To strike means to attack .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 21]: `` The Indians have struck on the frontier , '' -- `` A rattle-snake _ struck _ at me . ''

Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 18]: `` Well , now , I shall make tracks ; '' -- from foot-tracks in the snow .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 15]: Clear out , quit , and put -- all mean `` be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 29]: `` Captain , now , you _ hush _ or _ put _ '' -- that is , `` Either hold your tongue , or be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 10]: Also , `` Will you shut , mister ? ''

Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 5]: i.e. hold your tongue ?
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 21]: `` Curl up '' -- to be angry -- from the panther and other animals when angry raising their hair .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 17]: `` Rise my dandee up , '' from the human hair ; and a nasty idea .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 8]: `` Wrathy '' is another common expression .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 9]: Also , `` Savage as a meat-axe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 16]: Here are two real American words : -- `` Sloping '' -- for slinking away .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 8]: `` Splunging , '' like a porpoise .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 17]: The word `` enthusiasm , '' in the south , is changed to `` entuzzy-muzzy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 22]: In the Western states , where the racoon is plentiful , they use the abbreviation ` coon when speaking of people .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 40]: When at New York , I went into a hair-dresser 's shop to have my hair cut ; there were two young men front the west -- one under the barber 's hands , the other standing by him .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 25]: `` I say , '' said the one who was having his hair cut , `` I hear Captain is in the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 23]: `` Yes ; '' replied the other , `` so they say ; I should like to see the ` coon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 27]: `` I 'm a _ gone ` coon _ '' implies `` I am distressed -- _ or _ ruined -- _ or _ lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 46]: I once asked the origin of this expression , and was very gravely told as follows : -- `` There is a Captain Martin Scott -LRB- already mentioned in the Diary -RRB- in the United States Army who is a remarkable shot with a rifle .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 10]: He was raised , I believe , in Vermont .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 18]: His fame was so considerable through the state , that even the animals were aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 43]: He went out one morning with his rifle , and spying a racoon upon the upper branches of a high tree , brought his gun up to his shoulder ; when the racoon perceiving it , raised his paw for a parley .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 29]: ` I beg your pardon , mister , ' said the racoon , very politely ; ` but may I ask you if your name is Scott ? '
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 9]: -- ` Yes , ' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 8]: -- ` _ Martin _ Scott ? '
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 20]: continued the racoon -- ` Yes , ' replied the captain -- ` _ Captain _ Martin Scott ? '
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 5]: still continued the animal .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 15]: -- ` Yes , ' replied the captain , ` Captain Martin Scott ? '
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 4]: -- ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 28]: then , ' says the animal , ` I may just as well come down , for I 'm a _ gone ` coon _ . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 35]: But one of the strangest perversions of the meaning of a word which I ever heard of is in Kentucky , where sometimes the word _ nasty _ is used for _ nice _ .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 110]: For instance : at a rustic dance in that state a Kentuckian said to an acquaintance of mine , in reply to his asking the name of a very fine girl , `` That 's my sister , stranger ; and I flatter myself that she shows the _ nastiest _ ankle in all Kentuck '' -- _ Unde derivatur _ , from the constant rifle-practice in that state , a good shot or a pretty shot is termed also a nasty shot , because it would make a _ nasty _ wound : _ ergo _ , a nice or pretty ankle becomes a _ nasty _ one .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 18]: The term for all baggage , especially in the south or west , is `` plunder . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 36]: This has been derived from the buccaneers , who for so long a time infested the bayores and creeks near the mouth of the Mississippi , and whose luggage was probably very correctly so designated .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 10]: I must not omit a specimen of American criticism .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 17]: `` Well , Abel , what d'ye think of our native genus , Mister Forrest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 37]: `` Well , I do n't go much to theatricals , that 's a fact ; but I do think _ he piled the agony up a little too high _ in that last scene . ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 23]: The gamblers on the Mississippi use a very refined phrase for `` cheating '' -- `` playing the advantages over him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 21]: But , as may be supposed , the principal terms used are those which are borrowed from trade and commerce .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 12]: The rest , or remainder , is usually termed the balance .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 20]: `` Put some of those apples into a dish , and the _ balance _ into the storeroom . ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 27]: When a person has made a mistake , or is out in his calculation , they say , `` You missed a figure that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 55]: In a skirmish last war , the fire from the British was very severe , and the men in the American ranks were falling fast , when one of the soldiers stepped up to the commanding officer and said , `` Colonel , do n't you think that we might compromise this affair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 24]: `` Well , I reckon I should have no objection to _ submit it to arbitration _ myself , '' replied the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 10]: Even the thieves must be commercial in their ideas .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 34]: One rogue meeting another , asked him what he had done that morning ; `` Not much , '' was the reply , `` I 've only _ realised _ this umbrella . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 25]: This reminds me of a conversation between a man and his wife , which was overheard by the party who repeated it to me .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 40]: It appears that the lady was economically inclined , and in cutting out some shirts for her husband , resolved that they should not descend much lower than his hip ; as thereby so much linen would be saved .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 8]: The husband expostulated , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 73]: She pointed out to him that it would improve his figure , and make his nether garments set much better ; in a word , that long shirt-tails were quite unnecessary ; and she wound up her arguments by observing that linen was a very expensive article , and that she could not see what on earth was the reason that people should stuff so much _ capital _ into their pantaloons .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 15]: There is sometimes in the American metaphors , an energy which is very remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 29]: `` Well , I reckon , that from his teeth to his toe-nail , there 's not a human of a more conquering nature than General Jackson . ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 29]: One _ gentleman _ said to me , `` I wish I had all hell boiled down to a pint , just to pour down your throat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 45]: It is a great pity that the Americans have not adhered more to the Indian names , which are euphonous , and very often musical ; but , so far from it , they appear to have had a pleasure in dismissing them altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 44]: There is a river running into Lake Champlain , near Burlington , formerly called by the Indians the Winooski ; but this name has been superseded by the settlers , who , by way of improvement , have designated it the Onion river .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 35]: The Americans have ransacked scripture , and ancient and modern history , to supply themselves with names , yet , notwithstanding , there appears to be a strange lack of taste in their selection .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 30]: On the route to Lake Ontario you pass towns with such names as Manlius , Sempronius , Titus , Cato , and then you come to _ Butternuts _ .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 135]: Looking over the catalogue of cities , towns , villages , rivers , and creeks in the different states in the Union , I find the following repetitions : -- Of towns , etcetera , named after distinguished individuals , there are : -- Of other towns , etcetera , there are : -- In colours they have : -- Named after trees : -- After animals : -- After birds , etcetera : -- The consequence of these repetitions is , that if you do not put the name of the state , and often of the county in the state in which the town you refer to may be , your letter may journey all over the Union , and perhaps , after all , never arrive at its place of destination .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 45]: The states have already accommodated each other with nicknames , as per example : -- The names of persons are also very strange ; and some of them are , at all events , obsolete in England , even if they ever existed there .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 13]: Many of them are said to be French or Dutch names Americanised .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 43]: But they appear still more odd to us from the high sounding Christian names prefixed to them ; as , for instance : Philo Doolittle , Populorum Hightower , Preserved Fish , Asa Peabody , Alonzo Lilly , Alceus Wolf , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 45]: I was told by a gentleman that Doolittle was originally from the French Do l'hotel ; Peabody from Pibaudiere ; Bunker from Bon Coeur ; that Mr Ezekial Bumpus is a descendant of Monsieur Bon Pas , etcetera , all which is very possible .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 34]: Every one who is acquainted with Washington Irving must know that , being very sensitive himself , he is one of the last men in the world to do anything to annoy another .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 43]: In his selection of names for his writings , he was cautious in avoiding such as might be known ; so that , when he called his old schoolmaster Ichabod Crane , he thought himself safe from the risk of giving offence .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 45]: Shortly afterward a friend of his called upon him , accompanied by a stranger whom he introduced as Major Crane ; Irving started at the name ; `` Major Ichabod Crane , '' continued his friend , much to the horror of Washington Irving .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 29]: I was told that a merchant went down to New Orleans with one Christian name , and came back , after a lapse of years , with another .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 6]: His name was John Flint .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 40]: The French at New Orleans translated his surname , and called him Pierre Fusee -- on his return the Pierre stuck to him , and rendered into English as Peter , and he was called Peter Flint ever afterward .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 14]: People may change their names in the United States by application to Congress .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 26]: They have a story hardly worth relating , although considered a good one in America , having been told me by a member of congress .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 26]: A Mr Whitepimple , having risen in the world , was persuaded by his wife to change his name , and applied for permission accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 49]: The clerk of the office inquired of him what other name he would have , and he being very indifferent about it himself , replied carelessly , as he walked away , `` Oh , anything ; '' whereupon the clerk enrolled him as Mr _ Thing _ .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 66]: Time passed on , and he had a numerous family , who found the new name not much more agreeable than the old one , for there was Miss Sally Thing , Miss Dolly Thing , the old Things , and all the little Things ; and worst of all , the eldest son being christened Robert , went by the name of Thingum Bob .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 27]: There were , and I believe still are , two lawyers in partnership in New York , with the peculiarly happy names of Catchem and Chetum .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 30]: People laughed at seeing these two names in juxtaposition over the door ; so the lawyers thought it advisable to separate them by the insertion of their Christian names .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 13]: Mr Catchem 's Christian name was Isaac , Mr Chetum 's Uriah .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 29]: A new board was ordered , but when sent to the painter , it was found to be too short to admit the Christian names at full length .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 36]: The painter , therefore , put in only the initials before the surnames , which made the matter still worse than before , for there now appeared -- `` I Catchem and U Chetum . ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 18]: I can not conclude this chapter without adverting to one or two points peculiar to the Americans .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 70]: They wish , in everything , to improve upon the Old Country , as they call us , and affect to be excessively refined in their language and ideas : but they forget that very often in the covering , and the covering only , consists the indecency ; and that , to use the old aphorism -- `` Very nice people are people with very nasty ideas . ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 8]: They object to everything nude in statuary .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 58]: When I was at the house of Governor Everett , at Boston , I observed a fine cast of the Apollo Belvidere ; but in compliance with general opinion , it was hung with drapery , although Governor Everett himself is a gentleman of refined mind and high classical attainments , and quite above such ridiculous sensitiveness .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 8]: In language it is the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 18]: There are certain words which are never used in America , but an absurd substitute is employed .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 18]: I can not particularise them after this preface , lest I should be accused of indelicacy myself .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 20]: I may , however , state one little circumstance which will fully prove the correctness of what I say .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 18]: When at Niagara Falls I was escorting a young lady with whom I was on friendly terms .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 40]: She had been standing on a piece of rock , the better to view the scene , when she slipped down , and was evidently hurt by the fall : she had , in fact , grazed her shin .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 21]: As she limped a little in walking home , I said , `` Did you hurt your leg much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 39]: She turned from me , evidently much shocked , or much offended , -- and not being aware that I had committed any very heinous offence , I begged to know what was the reason of her displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 29]: After some hesitation , she said that as she knew me well , she would tell me that the word _ leg _ was never mentioned before ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 61]: I apologised for my want of refinement , which was attributable to having been accustomed only to _ English _ society ; and added , that as such articles must occasionally be referred to , even in the most polite circles in America , perhaps she would inform me by what name I might mention them without shocking the company .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 50]: Her reply was , that the word _ limb _ was used ; `` nay , '' continued she , `` I am not so particular as some people are , for I know those who always say limb of a table , or limb of a piano-forte . ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 35]: There the conversation dropped ; but a few months afterwards I was obliged to acknowledge that the young lady was correct when she asserted that some people were more particular than even she was .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 38]: I was requested by a lady to escort her to a seminary for young ladies , and on being ushered into the reception-room , conceive my astonishment at beholding a square piano-forte with four _ limbs _ .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 72]: However , that the ladies who visited their daughters might feel in its full force the extreme delicacy -LSB- see note at end of chapter -RSB- of the mistress of the establishment , and her care to preserve in their utmost purity the ideas of the young ladies under her charge , she had dressed all these four limbs in modest little trousers , with frills at the bottom of them !
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 46]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ `` An English lady , who had long kept a fashionable boarding-school in one of the Atlantic cities , told me that one of her earliest cares with every new-comer , was to endeavour to substitute real delicacy for that affected precision of manner .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 69]: Among many anecdotes , she told me of a young lady about fourteen , who , on entering the receiving-room , where she only expected to see a lady who had inquired for her , and finding a young man with her , put her hands before her eyes and ran out of the room again , screaming ` A man , a man , a man ! '
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 66]: On another occasion , one of the young ladies in going up stairs to the drawing-room , unfortunately met a boy of fourteen coming down , and her feelings were so violently agitated , that she stopped , panting and sobbing , nor would she pass on till the boy had swung himself up on the upper bannisters , to leave the passage free .

Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 7]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 4]: REMARKS -- CREDIT .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 42]: In the state of New York they have abolished imprisonment for debt ; this abolition however , only holds good between the citizens of that state , as no one state in the Union can interfere with the rights of another .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 32]: A stranger , therefore , can imprison a New Yorker , and a New Yorker can imprison a stranger , but the citizens of New York can not incarcerate one another .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 30]: Now although the unprincipled may , and do occasionally take advantage of this enactment , yet the effects of it are generally good , as character becomes more valuable .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 21]: Without character , there will be no credit -- and without credit no commercial man can rise in this city .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 49]: I was once in a store where the widow who kept it complained to me that a person who owed her a considerable sum of money would not pay her , and aware that she had no redress , I asked her how she would obtain her money .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 28]: Her reply was -- `` Oh , I shall eventually get my money , for I will _ shame _ him out of it by exposure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 25]: The Americans , probably from being such great speculators , and aware of the uncertainty attending their commerce , are very lenient towards debtors .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 22]: If a man proves that he can not pay , he is seldom interfered with , but allowed to recommence business .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 10]: This is not only Christians like , but wise .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 48]: A man thrown into prison is not likely to find the means of paying his debts ; but if allowed his liberty and the means of earning a subsistence , he may eventually be more fortunate , and the creditors have a chance of being ultimately paid .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 30]: This , to my knowledge , has often been the case after the release had been signed , and the creditors had no farther legal claim upon the bankrupt .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 62]: England has not yet made up her mind to the abolition of imprisonment for debt , but from what I have learnt in this city , I have no hesitation in saying , that it would work well for the morals of the community , and that more debts would eventually be paid , than are paid under the present system .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 34]: Another circumstance which requires to be pointed out when we would examine into the character of the New York commercial community , is , the difference between their bankrupt-laws and those of England .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 68]: Here there is no law to compel a bankrupt to produce his books ; every man may be his own assignee , and has the power of giving preference to one creditor over another ; that is to say , he may repay those who have lent him money in the hope of preventing his becoming a bankrupt , and all other debts of a like description .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 24]: He may also turn over his affairs to an assignee of his own selection , who then pays the debts as he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 11]: A bankrupt is also permitted to collect his own debts .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 46]: The English bankrupt laws were introduced , but after one year 's trial they were discontinued , as it was found they were attended with so much difficulty , and , what is of more importance to Americans , with so much loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 61]: Again , in America , if a person wishes to become a special partner -LRB- a sleeping partner -RRB- in any concern , he may do so to any extent he pleases , upon advertising the same , and is responsible for no more than the sum he invests , although the house should fail for ten times the amount .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 8]: Here is an advertisement of special partnership .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 3]: `` Co-partnership .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 49]: Notice is hereby given , that a limited partnership hath been entered into by Lambert Morange , DN Morange , and Samah Solomon , of the city of New York , merchants , in pursuance of the provisions of the revised statutes of the city of New York .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 20]: The general nature of the business of said co-partnership is the manufacturing and selling of fur and silk hats .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 83]: The said Lambert Morange is the special partner , and as such , hath contributed the sum of ten thousand dollars in cash to the common stock : the said DN Morange and Samah Solomon are the general partners ; and the said business is to be conducted under the name and firm of DN Morange and Solomon ; said co-partnership is to commence on the 14th day of March , 1837 , and to expire on the 14th March , 1840 .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 6]: `` March 14th , 1837 .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 3]: L. Morange .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 3]: D.N. Morange .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 4]: Samah Solomon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 39]: That this loose state of the bankrupt law may be , and has been a cause of much dishonesty , is true , but at the same it is the cause of the flourishing state of the community .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 18]: The bee can always work ; indeed the bankrupt-laws themselves provide for a man 's not starving .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 76]: In the city the bankrupt 's household furniture is sacred , that his family may not be beggars ; and in case of the bankruptcy of a farmer , he is permitted , not only to retain the furniture of his cottage , but even his plough , with a proportion of his team , his kine and sheep , are reserved for him , that he may still be able to support his family .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 36]: Surely this is much preferable to the English system under which the furniture is dragged away , the hearth made desolate , and the children left to starve , because their father has been unfortunate .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 22]: Is it not better that a little villainy should escape punishment , than that such cruelty should be in daily practice ?
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 72]: I say a little villainy , for if a man becomes bankrupt in New York , it is pretty well known whether he has dealt fairly with his creditors , or has made a fraudulent bankruptcy : and if so , his character is gone , and with it his credit , and without credit he never can rise again in that city , but must remove to some other place .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 26]: In England , character will procure to a bankrupt a certificate , but in New York it will leave him the means of re-commencing business .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 66]: In England , it is a disgrace to be a bankrupt ; in America , it is only a misfortune ; but this distinction arises from the boldness of the speculations carried on by the Americans in their commercial transactions , and owing to which the highest and most influential , as well as the smaller capitalists , are constantly in a state of jeopardy .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 20]: I do not believe that there is anywhere a class of merchants more honourable than those of New York .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 25]: The notorious Colonel Chartres said that he would give 20,000 pounds for a character , because he would have made 100,000 pounds by it .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 51]: I shall not here enter into the question , whether it is by a similar conviction , or by moral rectitude of feeling , that the merchants of New York are actuated ; it is sufficient that it is their interest to be honest , and that they are so .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 94]: I state the case in this way , because I do not intend to admit that the honesty of the merchants is any proof of the morality of a nation ; and I think I am borne out in my opinion by their conduct in the late state of difficulty , and the strenuous exertions made by them to pay to the uttermost farthing , sacrificing at times twenty per cent -- in order to be enabled to remit money to their London and Liverpool correspondents , and fulfil their engagements with them .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 39]: That there is a great deal of roguery going on in this city is undeniable , much more , perhaps , than -LRB- taking into consideration the difference between the populations -RRB- in the good city of London .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 26]: But it should be borne in mind that New York has become , as it were , the Alsatia of the whole continent of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 23]: Every scoundrel who has swindled , forged , or robbed in England , or elsewhere , makes his escape to New York .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 17]: Every pickpocket , who is too well known to the English police , takes refuge here .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 70]: In this city they all concentrate ; and it is a hard thing for the New York merchants , that the stream of society , which otherwise might gradually become more pure , should be thus poisoned by the continual inpourings of the continental dregs , and that they should be made to share in the obloquy of those who are outcasts from the society of the old world .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 7]: America exists at present upon credit .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 17]: If the credit of her merchants were destroyed she would be checked in her rapid advance .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 20]: But this system of credit , which is necessarily reciprocal , is nevertheless acted upon with all possible caution .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 31]: Many are the plans which the large New York importers have been compelled to resort to , to ascertain whether their customers from the interior could be trusted or not .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 62]: Agents have been despatched to learn the characters , standing , and means of the country dealers who are their correspondents , and who purchase their goods ; for the whole of the transactions are upon credit , and a book of reference as to people 's responsibility is to be found in many of the mercantile houses of New York .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 30]: Willing as I am to do justice to the New York merchants , I can not , however , permit Mr Carey 's remarks upon credit to pass unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 45]: Had he said nothing I should have said no more ; but , as he asserts that the security of property and credit in America is greater than in England , I must , in defence of my country , make a few observations .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 21]: At the commencement of his article Mr Carey says , -- `` In England confidence is _ almost _ universal .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 9]: The banker credits the manufacturer and the farmer .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 20]: They are willing to give credit to the merchant , because they have confidence that he will pay them .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 19]: He gives credit to the shopkeeper , who , in his turn , gives credit to the labourer .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 19]: `` Immense masses of property change owners without examination ; confidence thus producing a great saving of labour .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 38]: Orders to a vast extent are given , with a certainty that they will be executed with perfect good faith ; and this system is continued year after year , proving that the confidence was deserved . ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 11]: Now , after this admission what more can be required ?
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 25]: Confidence proves security of property , and should any change take place so as to render the security doubtful , confidence would immediately cease .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 42]: It is , therefore , rather bold of Mr Carey , after such an admission , to attempt to prove that the security of property is greater in America than in England ; yet , nevertheless , such is his assertion .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 28]: Mr Carey bases his calculation , first upon the losses sustained by the banks of England , in comparison with those sustained by the banks of Massachusetts .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 51]: Here , as in almost every other argument , Mr Carey selects one state -- a state , _ par excellence _ , superior to all the others of the Union ; a pattern state , in fact -- as representing _ all _ America against _ all _ England .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 38]: He admits that , as you go south or west , the complexion of things is altered ; but notwithstanding this admission , he still argues upon this one state only , and consequently upon false premises .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 45]: But allowing that he proved that the losses of all the banks in America were less than the losses of all the banks in England , he would still prove nothing , or if he did prove anything , it would be against himself .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 10]: Why are the losses of the American banks less ?
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 6]: Simply because they trust less .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 26]: There is not that confidence in America that there is in England , and the want of confidence proves the want of security of property .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 112]: The next comparison which Mr Carey makes is between the failures of the banks of the two countries ; and in this argument he takes most of the states in the Union into his calculation , and he winds up by observing -LRB- in italics -RRB- that -- `` From the first institution of banks in America to the year 1837 , the failures have been less by about one-fourth , than those of England in the three years of 1814 , 15 , and 16 ; and the amount of loss sustained by the public bears , probably , a still smaller proportion to the amount of business transactions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 33]: Now , all this proves nothing , except that the banks of America are more careful in discounting than our own , and that by running less risk they lose less money .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 43]: But from it Mr Carey draws this strange conclusion : -- `` Individuals in Great Britain enjoy as high a degree of _ credit _ as can possibly exist , but _ confidence _ is more universal in the United States . ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 42]: _ Credit _ is the result of _ confidence _ ; and if , as appears to be the case , the American confidence in each other will not procure credit , it is a very useless compliment passed between them .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 28]: It is simply this -- `` I am certain that you are a very honest man , but notwithstanding I will not lend you a shilling . ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 2]: Indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 30]: Mr Carey contradicts himself , for , two pages farther on , he says : -- `` The existence of the credit system is evidence of mutual confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 10]: I should like Mr Carey to answer one question .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 25]: What would have been the amount of the failures of the banks of America in 1836 , if they had not suspended cash payments ?
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 33]: It is very easy to carry on the banking business when , in defiance of their charters , the banks will give you nothing but their paper , and refuse you specie .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 25]: Banks which will not pay bullion for their own notes are not very likely to fail , except in their covenant with the public .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 25]: But it is of little use for Mr Carey to assert on the one hand , or for me to deny on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 28]: Every nation makes its own character with the rest of the world , and it is by other nations that the question between us must be decided .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 34]: The question is then , `` Is the credit of America better than that of England , in the intercourse of the two countries with each other , and with foreign nations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 6]: Let the commercial world decide .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 7]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER THIRTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 6]: REMARKS -- PENITENTIARIES , ETCETERA .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 45]: Although , during my residence in the cities of the United States , I visited most of the public institutions , I have not referred to them at the time in my Diary , as they have been so often described by preceding travellers ?
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 15]: I shall now , however , make a few remarks upon the penitentiary system .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 35]: I think it was Wilkes who said , that the very worst use to which you could put a man was to hang him ; and such appears to be the opinion in America .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 39]: That hanging does not prevent crime , where people are driven into it by misery and want , I believe ; but it does prevent crime where people commit it merely from an unrestrained indulgence of their passions .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 10]: This has been satisfactorily proved in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 42]: At one time the murders in the city of New Orleans were just as frequent as in all the states contiguous to the Mississippi ; but the population of the city determined to put an end to such scenes of outrage .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 33]: The population of New Orleans is very different from that of the southern states in general , being composed of Americans from the eastern states , English merchants , and French creoles .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 32]: Vigorous laws and an efficient police were established ; and one of the southern planters , of good family and connexions , having committed a murder , was tried and condemned .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 11]: To avoid the gallows , he committed suicide in prison .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 49]: This system having been rigorously followed up , New Orleans has become perhaps the _ safest _ city in the Union ; and now , not even a brawl is heard in those streets where , a few years back , murders occurred every hour of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 53]: In another chapter I shall enter more fully into this question : at present I shall only say that there is a great unwillingness to take away life in America , and it is this aversion to capital punishment which has directed the attention of the American community to the penitentiary system .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 17]: Several varieties of this species of punishment have been resorted to , more or less severe .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 40]: The most rigid -- that of solitary confinement in dark cells , and without labour -- was found too great an infliction , as , in many cases , it unsettled the reason , and ended in confirmed lunacy .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 30]: Confinement , with the boon of light , but without employment , was productive of no good effect ; the culprit sank into a state of apathy and indifference .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 23]: After a certain time , day and night passed away unheeded , from the want of a healthy tone to the mind .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 16]: The prisoners were no longer lunatics , but they were little better than brute animals .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 40]: Neither do I consider the present system , as practised at Sing Sing , the state prison of New York , as tending to _ reform _ the offenders ; it punishes them severely , but that is all .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 33]: Where corporal punishment is resorted to , there always will be feelings of vindictiveness ; and all the bad passions must be allowed to repose before the better can gain the ascendant .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 25]: The best system that is acted upon in the Penitentiary at Philadelphia , where there is solitary confinement , but with labour and exercise .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 38]: Mr Samuel Wood , who superintends this establishment , is a person admirably calculated for his task , and I do not think that any arrangements could be better , or the establishment in more excellent hands .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 33]: But my object was , not so much to view the prison and witness the economy of it , as to examine the prisoners themselves , and hear what their opinions were .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 36]: The surgeon may explain the operation , but the patient who has undergone it is the proper person to apply to , if you wish to know the degree and nature of the pain inflicted .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 64]: I requested , therefore , and obtained permission , to visit a portion of the prisoners without a third party being present to prevent their being communicative ; selecting some who had been in but a short time , others who had been there for years , and referring also to the books , as to the nature and degree of their offence .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 29]: I ought to state that I re-examined almost the whole of the parties about six months afterward , and the results of the two examinations are now given .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 23]: I did not take their names , but registered them in my notes as No. 1 , 2 , 3 , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 21]: No. 1 -- a man who had been sentenced to twelve years ' imprisonment for the murder of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 9]: He had been bred up as a butcher .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 68]: -LRB- I have observed that when the use of the knife is habitual , the flinching which men naturally feel at the idea of driving it into a fellow-creature , is overcome ; and a man who is accustomed to dissect the still palpitating carcasses of animals , has very little compunction in resorting to the knife in the event of collision with his own race . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 21]: This fellow looked a butcher ; his face and head were all animal ; he was by no means intelligent .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 19]: He was working at a loom , and had already been confined for seven years and a half .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 47]: He said that , after the first six months of his confinement , he had lost all reckoning of time , and had not cared to think about it until lately , when he inquired , and was told how long he had been locked up .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 28]: Now that he had discovered that more than half his time had passed away , it occupied his whole thoughts , and sometimes he felt very impatient .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 26]: Mr Wood told me afterwards that this feeling , when the expiration of the sentence was very near at hand , sometimes amounted to agony .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 29]: This man had denied the murder of his wife , and still persisted in the denial , although there was no doubt of his having committed the crime .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 34]: Of course , in this instance there was no repentance ; and the Penitentiary was thrown away upon him , farther than that , for twelve years , he could not contaminate society .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 18]: No. 2 -- sentenced to four years ' imprisonment for forgery ; his time was nearly expired .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 15]: This was a very intelligent man ; by profession he had been a schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 11]: He had been in prison before for the same offence .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 21]: His opinion as to the Penitentiary was , that it could do no harm , and might do much good .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 25]: The fault of the system was one which could not well be remedied , which was , that there was degradation attached to it .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 63]: Could punishment undergone for crime be viewed in the same way as repentance was by the Almighty , and a man , after suffering for his fault , re-appear in the world with clean hands , and be admitted into society as before , it would be attended with the very best effects ; but there was no working out the degradation .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 23]: When he was released from his former imprisonment , he had been obliged to fly from the place where he was known .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 20]: He was pursued by the harshness of the world , not only in himself , but in his children .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 32]: No one would allow that his punishment had wiped away his crime , and this was the reason why people , inclined to be honest , were driven again into guilt .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 49]: Not only would the world not encourage them , but it would not permit them to become honest ; the finger of scorn was pointed wherever they were known , or found out , and the punishment after release was infinitely greater than that of the prison itself .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 32]: Miss Martineau observes , `` I was favoured with the confidence of a great number of the prisoners in the Philadelphia Penitentiary , where absolute seclusion is the principle of punishment .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 41]: Every one of these prisoners -LRB- none of them being aware of the existence of any other -RRB- told me that he was under obligations to those who had charge of him for treating him ` with respect . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 18]: No 3 -- a very intelligent , but not educated man : imprisoned three years for stealing .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 26]: He had only been a few months in the penitentiary , but had been confined for ten years in Sing Sing prison for picking pockets .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 16]: I asked him his opinion as to the difference of treatment in the two establishments .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 18]: He replied , `` In Sing Sing the punishment is corporal -- here it is more mental .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 35]: In Sing Sing there was little chance of a person 's reformation , as the treatment was harsh and brutal , and the feelings of the prisoners were those of indignation and resentment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 25]: Their whole time was occupied in trying how they could deceive their keepers , and communicate with each other by every variety of stratagem .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 24]: Here a man was left to his own reflections , and at the same time he was treated like a _ man _ .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 16]: Here he was his own tormentor ; at Sing Sing he was tormented by others .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 24]: A man was sent to Sing Sing for doing wrong to others ; when there , he was quite as much wronged himself .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 7]: Two wrongs never made a right .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 35]: Again , at Sing Sing they all worked in company , and knew each other ; when they met again , after they were discharged , they enticed one another to do wrong again .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 17]: He was convinced that no man left Sing Sing a better man than he went in .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 15]: He here felt very often that he could become better -- perhaps he might .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 19]: At all events his mind was calm , and he had no feelings of resentment for his treatment .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 18]: He had now leisure and quiet for self-examination , if he chose to avail himself of it .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 11]: At Sing Sing there was great injustice and no redress .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 22]: The infirm man was put to equal labour with the robust , and punished if he did not perform as much .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 9]: The flogging was very severe at Sing Sing .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 31]: He once ventured to express his opinion that such was the case , and -LRB- to prove the contrary he supposed -RRB- they awarded him eighty-seven lashes for the information .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 59]: That many of this man 's observations , in the parallel drawn between the two establishments , are correct , must be conceded ; but still some of his assertions must be taken with due reservation , as it is evident that he had no very pleasant reminiscences of his ten years ' geological studies in Sing Sing .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 9]: No. 4 -- an Irishman ; very acute .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 18]: He had been imprisoned seven years for burglary , and his time would expire in a month .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 20]: He had been confined also in Walnut-street prison , Philadelphia , for two years previous to his coming here .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 21]: He said that it was almost impossible for any man to reform in that prison , although some few did .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 11]: He had served many years in the United States navy .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 33]: He declared that his propensity to theft was only strong upon him when under the influence of liquor , or tobacco , which latter had the same effect upon him as spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 37]: He thought that he was reformed now ; the reason why he thought so was , that he now liked work , and had learnt a profession in the prison , which he never had before .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 19]: He considered himself a good workman , as he could make a pair of shoes in a day .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 12]: He can not now bear the smell of liquor or tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 23]: -LRB- This observation must have been from imagination , as he had no opportunity in the Penitentiary of testing his dislike . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 9]: He ascribed all his crimes to ardent spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 21]: He was fearful of only one thing : his time was just out , and where was he to go ?
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 15]: If known to have been in the prison , he would never find work .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 20]: He knew a fact which had occurred , which would prove that he had just grounds for his fear .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 24]: A tailor , who had been confined in Walnut-street prison with him , had been released as soon as his time was up .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 15]: He was an excellent workman , and resolved for the future to be honest .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 18]: He obtained employment from a master tailor in Philadelphia , and in three months was made foreman .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 23]: One of the inspectors of Walnut-street prison came in for clothes , and his friend was called down to take the measures .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 25]: The inspector recognised him , and as soon as he left the shop told his master that he had been in the Walnut-street prison .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 8]: The man was in consequence immediately discharged .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 26]: He could obtain no more work , and in a few months afterwards found his way back again to Walnut-street prison for a fresh offence .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 13]: No. 5 -- a fine intelligent Yankee , very bold in bearing .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 35]: He was in the penitentiary under a false name , being well connected had been brought up as an architect and surveyor , and was imprisoned for having counterfeit bank notes in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 23]: This fellow was a regular lawyer , and very amusing ; it appeared as if nothing could subdue his elasticity of spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 28]: He said that he did not think that he should be better for his incarceration ; on the contrary , that it would produce very bad effects .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 25]: `` I am punished , '' said he , `` not for having passed counterfeit notes , but for having them in my possession .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 38]: The facts are , I had lost all my money by gambling ; and then the gamblers , to make me amends , gave me some of their counterfeit notes , which they always have by them .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 34]: I do not say that I should not have uttered them ; I believe that in my distress I should have done so ; but I had not exactly made up my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 22]: At all events , _ I had not _ passed them when , from information given , I was taken up .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 77]: This is certain , that not having passed them , it is very possible for a man to have forged notes in his possession without being aware of it ; but this was not considered by my judges , although it ought to have been , as I had never been brought up before ; and I have now been sentenced to exactly the same term of imprisonment as those who were convicted of passing them .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 42]: Now , this I consider as unfair ; my punishment is too severe for my offence , and that always does harm -- it creates a vindictive feeling , and a desire to revenge yourself for the injustice done to you .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 78]: `` Now , sir , '' continued he , `` I should have no objection to compromise ; if they would reduce my punishment one-half , I would acknowledge the justice of it , and turn honest when I go out again ; but , if I am confined here for three years , why , it is my opinion , that I shall revenge myself upon society as soon as I am turned loose again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 19]: This was said in a very cheerful , playful manner , as he stood up before his loom .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 15]: A more energetic expression , a keener grey eye , I never met with .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 11]: There was evidently great daring of soul in this man .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 29]: No 6 -- had only been confined six weeks ; his offence was stealing pigs , and his companion in the crime had been sent here with him .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 17]: He declared that he was innocent , and that he had been committed by false swearing .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 51]: There is no country in the world where there is so much perjury as in the United States , if I am to believe the Americans themselves ; but Mr Wood told me that he was present at the trial , and that there was no doubt of their guilt .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 20]: This man was cheerful and contented ; he was working at the loom , and had already become skilful .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 46]: All whom I had seen up to the present had employment of some sort or other , and should have passed over this man , as I had done some others , if it had not been for the contrast between him and his companion .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 8]: No. 7 -- His companion or accomplice .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 16]: In consequence of the little demand for the penitentiary manufactures this man had no employment .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 19]: The first thing he told me was that he had nothing to do , and was very miserable .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 11]: He earnestly requested me to ask for employment for him .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 29]: He cried bitterly while he spoke , was quite unmanned and depressed , and complained that he had not been permitted to hear from his wife and children .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 38]: The want of employment appeared to have completely prostrated this man ; although confined but six weeks , he had already lost the time , and inquired of me the day of the week and the month .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 7]: No. 8 -- was at large .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 24]: He had been appointed apothecary to the prison ; of course he was not strictly confined , and was in a comfortable room .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 38]: He was a shrewd man , and evidently well educated ; he had been reduced to beggary by his excesses , and being too proud to work , he had not been too proud to commit forgery .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 33]: I had a long conversation with him , and he made some sensible remarks upon the treatment of prisoners , and the importance of delegating the charge of prisoners to competent persons .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 21]: His remarks also upon American juries were very severe , and , as I subsequently ascertained , but too true .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 20]: No. 9 -- a young woman about nineteen , confined for larceny ; in other respects a good character .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 36]: She was very quiet and subdued , and said that she infinitely preferred the solitude of the penitentiary to the company with which she must have associated had she been confined in a common gaol .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 14]: She did not appear at all anxious for the expiration of her term .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 18]: Her cell was very neat , and ornamented with her own hands in a variety of ways .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 64]: I observed that she had a lock of hair on her forehead which , from the care taken of it , appeared to be a favourite , and , as I left the cell , I said -- `` You appear to have taken great pains with that lock of hair , considering that you have no one to look at you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 35]: -- `` Yes , sir , '' replied she ; `` and if you think that vanity will desert a woman , even in the solitude of a penitentiary , you are mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 48]: When I visited this girl a second time , her term was nearly expired ; she told me that she had not the least wish to leave her cell , and that , if they confined her for two years more , she was content to stay .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 22]: `` I am quite peaceful and happy here , '' she said , and I believe she really spoke the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 68]: No. 10 -- a free mulatto girl , about eighteen years of age , one of the most forbidding of her race , and with a physiognomy perfectly brutal ; but she evidently had no mean opinion of her own charms : her woolly hair was twisted into at least fifty short plaits , and she grinned from ear to ear as she advanced to meet me .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 13]: `` Pray , may I inquire what you are imprisoned for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 50]: said I. -- `` Why , sir , '' replied she , smirking , smiling , and coquetting , as she tossed her head right and left , -- `` If you please , sir , I was put in here for poisoning a _ whole family _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 14]: She really appeared to think that she had done a very praiseworthy act .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 15]: I inquired of her if she was aware of the heinousness of her offence .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 29]: `` Yes , she knew it was wrong , but if her mistress beat her again as she had done , she thought she would do it again .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 16]: She had been in prison three years , and had four more to remain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 28]: I asked her if the fear of punishment -- if another incarceration for seven years would not prevent her from committing such a crime a second time .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 45]: `` She did n't know ; she did n't like being shut up -- found it very tedious , but still she thought -- was not quite sure -- but she thought that , if ill-treated , she should certainly do it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 20]: I paid a second visit to this amiable young lady , and asked her what her opinion was then .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 39]: -- `` Why , she had been thinking , but had not exactly made up her mind -- but she still thought -- indeed , she was convinced -- that she _ should do it again _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 24]: I entered many other cells , and had conversations with the prisoners but I did not elicit from them any thing worth narrating .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 19]: There is , however , a great deal to be gained from the conversation which I have recorded .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 68]: It must be remembered , that observations made by one prisoner , which struck me as important , if not made by others , were put as questions by me ; and I found that the opinions of the most intelligent , although differently expressed , led to the same result -- that the present system of the Philadelphia penitentiary was the best that had been invented .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 17]: As the schoolmaster said , if it did no good , it could do no harm .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 62]: There is one decided advantage in this system , which is , that they all learn a trade , if they had not one before ; and , when they leave the prison , have the means of obtaining an honest livelihood , if they wish so to do themselves , _ and are permitted so to do by others _ .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 20]: Here is the stumbling-block which neutralises almost all the good effects which might be produced by the penitentiary system .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 65]: The severity and harshness of the world ; the unchristianlike feeling pervading society , which denies to the penitent what individually they will have to plead for themselves at the great tribunal , and which will not permit that punishment , awarded and suffered , can expiate the crime ; on this point , there is no hope of a better feeling being engendered .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 40]: Mankind have been , and will be , the same ; and it is only to be hoped that we may receive more mercy in the next world than we are inclined to extend toward our fellow-creatures in this .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 55]: As I have before observed , I care little for the observations or assertions of directors or of officers entrusted with the charge of the penitentiaries and houses of correction ; they are unintentionally biased , and things that appear to them to be mere trifles are very often extreme hardships to the prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 48]: It is not only what the body suffers , but what the mind suffers , which must be considered ; and it is from the want of this consideration that arise most of the defects in those establishments , not only in America , but everywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 50]: During my residence in the United States , a little work made its appearance , which I immediately procured ; it was the production of an American , a scholar , once in the best society , but who , by intemperance , had forfeited his claim to it .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 104]: He wrote the very best satirical poem I ever read by an American , full of force , and remarkable for energetic versification ; but intemperance , the prevalent vice of America , had induced him to beggary and wretchedness , he was -LRB- by his own request I understand -RRB- shut up in the house of correction at South Boston , that he might , if possible , be reclaimed from intemperance ; and , on his leaving it , he published a small work , called `` The Rat-Trap , or Cogitations of a Convict in the House of Correction . ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 62]: This work bears the mark of a reflective , although buoyant mind ; and as he speaks in the highest terms of Mr Robbins , the master , and bestows praise generally when deserved , his remarks , although occasionally jocose , are well worthy of attention and I shall , therefore , introduce a few of them to the reader .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 47]: His introduction commences thus : -- `` I take it for granted that one of every two individuals in this _ most moral community in the world _ has been , will be , or deserves or fears to be , in the house of correction .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 12]: Give every man his deserts , and who shall escape whipping ?
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 25]: This book must , therefore , be interesting , and will have a good circulation -- not , perhaps , in this state alone .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 53]: The state spends its money for the above institution , and , therefore , has a right to know what it is ; a knowledge which can never be obtained from the reports of the authorities , the cursory observations of visitors , or the statements of ignorant and exasperated convicts . ''
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 17]: ` What thief e'er felt the halter draw , With good opinion of the law . '
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 29]: `` It has been my aim to furnish such knowledge , and it can not be denied that I have had the best opportunities to obtain it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 87]: To show the prevalence of intemperance in this country among the better classes , read the following : -- `` On entering the wool-shop , a man nodded to me , whom I immediately recognised as a lawyer of no mean talent , who had , at no very distant period , been an ornament of society , and a man well esteemed for many excellent qualities , all of which are now forgotten , while his only fault , intemperance , remains engraven on steel .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 15]: This was not his first term , or his second , or his third .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 23]: At this time of writing he is discharged , a sober man , anxious for employment , which he can not get .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 29]: His having been in the house of correction shuts every door against him , and he must have more than ordinary firmness if he does not relapse again .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 8]: From my inmost soul I pity him .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 24]: Another aged man I recognised as a doctor of medicine : his grey hairs would have been venerable in any other place . ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 23]: The labour in this house of correction which he describes is chiefly confined to wool-picking , stone-cutting , and blacksmiths ' work .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 16]: The fare he states to be plentiful , but not of the very best quality .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 32]: Speaking of ill-treatment , he says : -- `` The convicts all have the privilege of complaint against officers ; but while I was there no one used it but myself .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 6]: I believe they dared not .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 43]: The officer would probably deny or gloss over the cause of complaint , and his word would be believed rather than that of the convict ; and his power of retaliation is so tremendous , that few would care to brave it .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 43]: The chance is ten to one that a complaint to the directors would be falsified and proved fruitless ; and the visit of the governor , council , and magistrates , for the purpose of inquiry , is mere matter of form .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 50]: When they asked me if I had reason to complain of my treatment , I answered in the negative , because I really had none ; but had they asked me if there was any defect in the institution , I would have pointed out a good many . ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 20]: The monotony of their existence is well described : -- `` Few incidents chequered the monotony of our existence .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 13]: ` Who has got a piece of steel in his eye ? '
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 10]: -- ` Who has gone to the hospital ? '
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 11]: -- ` How many came to-day in the carry-all ? '
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 9]: were almost the only questions we could ask .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 25]: A man falling from the new prison , and breaking his bones in a fashion not to be approved , was a conversational godsend .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 59]: One day the retiring tide left a small box on the sands at the bottom of the house of correction wharf , which was picked up by a convict , and found to contain the bequest of some woman who had ` loved not wisely , but too well , ' namely , a pair of new-born infants .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 9]: In my mind , their fate was happy .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 17]: If they never knew woman 's tenderness , neither did they ever know woman 's falsehood .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 23]: There is less pleasure than pain in this bad world , and the earlier we take leave of it the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 32]: He complains of due regard not being paid to the cleanliness of the prisoners : -- `` A great defect in the police of the house was the want of baths .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 13]: We were shaved , or rather scraped , but once a week .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 23]: Washing one 's face and hands in ice-cold water of a winter morning , is little better than no ablution at all .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 30]: The harbour water is interdicted , lest the convicts should swim away , and in the stone-shop there are no conveniences for bathing whatever : they would cost something !
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 15]: In the wool-shop , forty men have one tubful of warm water once a-week .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 43]: When I say that shirts are worn a week in summer , and -LRB- as well as drawers -RRB- two or three weeks in winter , it will at once be conceded that some farther provision for personal cleanliness is imperatively demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 39]: I hope neither this nor any other remark I may think fit to make will be taken as emanating from a fault-finding spirit , since , while I pronounce upon the disease , I suggest the remedy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 35]: Speaking of his companions , he says : -- `` I had expected to find myself linked with a band of most outrageous ruffians , but such did not prove to be the case .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 10]: Few of them were decidedly of a vicious temperament .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 16]: The great fault with them seemed to be a want of moral knowledge and principle .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 53]: Were I to commit a theft I should think myself unworthy to live an instant ; but some of them spoke of the felonies for which they were adjudged to suffer with as much _ nonchalance _ as if they were the every-day business of life , without scruple and without shame .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 32]: Few of them denied the justice of their sentences ; and if they expressed any regret , it was not that they had sinned , but that they had been detected .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 25]: The duration of the sentence , the time or money lost , the physical suffering , was what filled their estimate of their condition .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 36]: Many had groans and oaths for a lost dinner , a night in the cells , or a tough piece of work , but none had a tear for the branding infamy of their conviction .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 32]: Yet some , even of the most hardened , faltered , and spoke with quivering lip and glistening eye , when they thought of their parents , wives , and children .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 17]: The flinty Horeb of their souls sometimes yielded gushing streams to the force of that appeal .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 14]: But there were very few who felt any shame on their own account .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 10]: Their apathy on the point of honour was amazing .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 35]: A young man , not twenty-five years old , in particular , made his felonies his glory , and boasted that he had been a tenant of half the prisons in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 49]: He was sentenced to four years ' imprisonment for stealing a great number of pieces of broadcloth , which he unblushingly told me he had lodged in the hands of a receiver of stolen goods , and expected to receive the value at the expiration of his sentence .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 11]: He relied on the proverbial ` honour among thieves . '
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 17]: That fellow ought to be kept in safe custody the remainder of his natural life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 14]: Certainly those remarks do not argue much for the reformation of the culprit .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 18]: By his account , a parsimony in every point appears to be the great desideratum aimed at .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 32]: Speaking of the chaplain to the institution , he says : -- `` Small blame to him ; I honour and respect the man , though I laugh at the preacher .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 32]: And I say , that seven hundred and thirty sermons _ per annum _ , for three hundred dollars and a weekly dinner , are quite pork enough for a shilling .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 19]: No man goeth a warfare on his own charges , and the labourer is worthy of his hire .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 27]: I do not see how he can justify such wear and tear of his pulmonary leather , for so small a sum , to his conscience .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 10]: What is a sixpenny razor or a nine-shilling sermon ?
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 26]: Neither can be expected to cut -- not but his sermons would be very good for the use of glorified saints -- but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 10]: there are none such in the House of Correction .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 8]: What is the inspiration of a penny-a-liner ?
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 23]: I will suppose that one of the hearers is a sailor , who would relish and appreciate a sausage or a lobscouse .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 10]: Mr -- sets _ blanc mange _ before him .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 71]: -- Messrs. of the city government give your chaplain two thousand dollars a-year , so that he may reside in the house of correction , without leaving his family to starvation ; let him visit each individual , learn his circumstances and character , and sympathise with him in all his sorrows , and , my word for it , Mr -- will have the love and confidence of all .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 14]: He will be an instrument of great good by his counsel and exhortations .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 26]: But as for his public preaching , this truly good , pious , and learned man might as well sing psalms to a mad horse .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 23]: Fishes will not throng to St Anthony , or swine listen to the exorcism of an apostle , in these godless days .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 33]: If you think he will be overpaid for his services , you may braze the duty of a schoolmaster , who is very much needed , to that of a ghostly adviser .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 41]: `` Mr -- never fails to pray strenuously that the master and officers may be supported and sustained , which has given rise to the following tin-pot epigram : -- `` Support the master and the overseers , O Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 25]: so runs our chaplain 's weekly ditty ; Unreasonable prayers God never hears , He knows that they 're supported by the city . ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 21]: He complains bitterly of the convicts not being permitted the use of any books but the Bible and temperance Almanac .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 33]: It is rather strange , but he says that he supposes that a full half of the inmates of the house of correction can neither _ read _ nor _ write _ .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 39]: `` Is it pleasant to look back on follies , vices , crimes ; presently on blasted hopes , iron bars , and unrequited labour ; and forward upon misery , starvation , and a world 's scorn ?
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 24]: In some degree the malice of this regulation , which ought only to be inscribed on the statute-book of hell , is impotent .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 43]: The small glimpse of earth , sea , and sky a convict can command , a spider crawling upon the wall , the very corners of his cell , will serve , by a strong effort , for occupation for his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 40]: Read the following tea-pot-graven monologue , written by some mentally-suffering convict , and reflect upon it : -- `` Stone walls and iron bars my frame confine , But the full liberty of thought is mine , Sad privilege !
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 15]: the mental glance to cast O'er crimes , o'er follies , and misconduct past .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 17]: Oh wretched tenant of a guarded cell , Thy very freedom makes thy mind a hell .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 39]: Come , blessed death ; thy grinded dart to me , Shall the bless 'd signal of deliverance be ; With thy worst agonies were cheaply bought , A last release , a final rest from thought . ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 37]: `` If the pains of a prison be not enough for you , I will teach you a lesson in the art of torture which I learned from our chaplain , or one of his substitutes .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 48]: -- ` Make your cells round and smooth ; let there be no prominent point for the eye to rest upon , so that it must necessarily turn inward , and I will warrant that you will soon have the pleasure of seeing your victim frantic . '
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 46]: Look well to the temperance trash you physic us with , and you will find , in the Almanac for 1837 , a serious attempt to make Napoleon Bonaparte out a drunkard , and to prove that a rum-bottle lost him the battle of Waterloo .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 12]: The author must himself have been drunk when he wrote it .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 25]: Are you not ashamed to set such pitiful cant , I will not say such wilful falsehood and slander , before any rational creature ?
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 17]: Did you not know that an overcharged gun would knock the musketeer over by its recoil ?
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 59]: I do not tell you to give the convicts all and any books they may desire ; but pray what harm would an arithmetic do , unless it taught them to refute the statistics of your lying almanac , which gravely advises farmers to feed their hogs with apples , to prevent folks from getting drunk on cider ?
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 17]: Why not tell them to feed their cattle with barley and wheat for the same reason ?
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 16]: What mind was ever corrupted by Murray 's Grammar , or Washington Irving 's Columbus ?
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 11]: When was ever falsehood the successful pioneer of truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 13]: His remarks upon visitors being permitted to see the convicts are good .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 34]: `` Among the annoyances , which others as well as myself felt most galling , was the frequent intrusion of visitors , who had no object but the gratification of a morbid curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 25]: Know all persons , that the most debased convict has human feelings , and does not like to be seen in a parti-coloured jacket .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 68]: If you want to see any convict for any good reason , ask the master to let you meet him in his office ; and even there , you may rely upon it , your visit will be painful enough ; to be stared at by the ignorant and the mean with feelings of pity , as if one were some monster of Ind , was intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 38]: I hope a certain connexion of mine , who came to see me unasked and unwelcome , and brought a stranger with him to witness my disgrace , may never feel the pain he inflicted on me .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 34]: To a kind-hearted ` Mac , ' who came in a proper and delicate way to comfort when I thought all the world had forsaken me , I tender my most grateful thanks .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 13]: His kindness shall be remembered by me while memory holds her seat .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 36]: Let the throng of uninvited fools who swarmed about us , accept the following sally of the house of correction muse , from the pen , or rather the fork , of a fellow convict .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 6]: It may operate to edification .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 5]: `` To Our Visitors .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 14]: `` By gazing at us , sirs , pray what do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 10]: Are we the first rascals that ever were seen ?
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 18]: Look into your mirrors -- perhaps you may find All villains are not in South Boston confined .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 52]: `` I 'm not a wild beast , to be seen for a penny ; But a man , as well made and as proper as any ; And what we most differ in is , well I wot , That I have my merits , and you have them not .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 50]: `` I own I 'm a drunkard , but much I incline To think that your elbow crooks as often as mine ; Ay , breathe in my face , sir , as much as you will -- One blast of your breath is as good as a gill .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 22]: `` How kind was our country to find us a home Where duns can not plague us , or enemies come !
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 23]: And you from the cup of her kindness may drain A _ drop _ so sufficing , you 'll not drink again .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 44]: `` And now that by staring with mouth and eyes open , We have bruised the reeds that already were broken ; Go home and , by dint of strict mental inspection , Let each make his own house a house of correction .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 12]: `` This _ morceau _ was signed ` Indignans . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 50]: The following muster-roll of crime , as he terms it , which he obtained from the master of the prison , is curious , as it exemplifies the excess of intemperance in the United States -- bearing in mind that this is the _ moral _ state of Massachusetts .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 34]: `` The whole number of males committed to the house of correction from the time it was opened -- July 1st , 1833 , to September 1st , 1837 , -- was 1477 .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 14]: Of this number there were common drunkards 783 , or more than one-half .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 23]: `` The whole amount of females committed to this institution from the time it was opened to Sept 1837 , was 869 .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 13]: Of this number there were common drunkards 430 , very nearly one-half .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 51]: `` And of the whole number committed there were -- '' He sums up as follows : -- `` I have nearly finished , but I should not do justice to my subject did I omit to advert to the beggarly catch-penny system on which the whole concern is conducted .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 33]: The convicts raise pork and vegetables in plenty , but they must not eat thereof ; these things must be sent to market to balance the debit side of the prison ledger .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 28]: The prisoners must catch cold and suffer in the hospital , and the wool and stone shops , because it would cost something to erect comfortable buildings .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 25]: They must not learn to read and write , lest a cent 's worth of their precious time should be lost to the city .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 22]: They may die and go to hell , and be damned , for a resident physician and chaplain are expensive articles .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 15]: They may be dirty ; baths would cost money , and so would books .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 17]: I believe the very Bibles and almanacks are the donation of the Bible and Temperance societies .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 25]: Every thing is managed with an eye to money-making -- the comfort or reformation , or salvation , of the prisoners are minor considerations .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 5]: Whose fault is this ?
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 12]: `` The fault , most frugal public , is your own .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 14]: You like justice , but you do not like to pay for it .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 30]: You like to see a clean , orderly , well conducted prison , and , as far as your parsimony will permit , such is the house of correction .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 12]: With all its faults , it is still a valuable institution .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 12]: It holds all , it harms few , and reforms some .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 13]: It looks well , for the most has been made of matters .

Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 6]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER FORTY .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 4]: REMARKS -- ARMY .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 65]: Isolated as the officers are from the world , -LRB- for these forts are far removed from towns or cities , -RRB- they contrived to form a society within themselves , having most of them recourse to matrimony , which always gives a man something to do , and acts as a fillip upon his faculties , which might stagnate from such quiet monotony .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 15]: The society , therefore , at these outposts is small , but very pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 32]: All the officers being now educated at West Point , they are mostly very intelligent and well informed , and soldiers ' wives are always agreeable women all over the world .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 16]: The barracks turned out also a very fair show of children upon the green sward .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 42]: The accommodations are , generally speaking , very good , and when supplies can be received , the living is equally so ; when they can not , it ca n't be helped , and there is so much money saved .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 68]: A suttler 's store is attached to each outpost , and the prices of the articles are regulated by a committee of officers , and a tax is also levied upon the suttler in proportion to the number of men in the garrison , the proceeds of which are appropriated to the education of the children of the soldiers and the provision of a library and news-room .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 55]: If the government were to permit officers to remain at any one station for a certain period , much more would be done ; but the government is continually shifting them from post to post , and no one will take the trouble to sow when he has no chance of reaping the harvest .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 41]: Indeed , many of the officers complained that they hardly had time to furnish their apartments in one fort when they were ordered off to another -- not only a great inconvenience to them , but a great expense also .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 18]: The American army is not a favourite service , and this is not to be wondered at .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 52]: It is ill-treated in every way ; the people have a great dislike to them , which is natural enough in a Democracy ; but what is worse , to curry favour with the people , the government very often do not support the officers in the execution of their duty .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 35]: Their furloughs are very limited , and they have their choice of the outposts , where they live out of the world , or the Florida war , when they go out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 29]: But the greatest injustice is , that they have no half-pay : if not wishing to be employed they must resign their commissions and live as they can .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 53]: In this point there is a great partiality shown to the navy , who have such excellent half-pay , although to prevent remarks at such glaring injustice to the other service , another term is given to the naval half-pay , and the naval officers are supposed to be always on service .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 77]: The officers of the army are paid a certain sum , and allowed a certain number of rations per month ; for instance , a major-general has two hundred dollars per month , and fifteen rations : According to the estimated value of the rations , as given to me by one of the officers , the annual pay of the different grades will be , in our money , nearly as follows : -- Army .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 10]: The cavalry officers have a slight increase of pay .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 36]: The privates of the American regular army are not the most creditable soldiers in the world ; they are chiefly composed of Irish emigrants , Germans , and deserters from the English regiments in Canada .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 31]: Americans are very rare ; only those who can find nothing else to do , and have to choose between enlistment and starvation , will enter into the American army .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 13]: They do not , however , enlist for longer than three years .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 23]: There is not much discipline , and occasionally a great deal of insolence , as might be expected from such a collection .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 56]: Corporal punishment has been abolished in the American army except for desertion ; and if ever there was a proof of the necessity of punishment to enforce discipline , it is the many substitutes in lieu of it , to which the officers are compelled to resort -- all of them more severe than flogging .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 73]: The most common is that of loading a man with thirty-six pounds of shot in his knapsack , and making him walk three hours out of four , day and night without intermission , with this weight on his shoulders , for six days and six nights ; that is , he is compelled to walk three hours with the weight , and then is suffered to sit down _ one _ .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 30]: Towards the close this punishment becomes very severe ; the feet of the men are so sore and swelled , that they can not move for some days afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 21]: I inquired what would be the consequence if a man were to throw down his knapsack and refuse to walk .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 27]: The commanding-officer of one of the forts replied , that he would be hung up by the thumbs till he fainted -- a variety of piquetting .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 18]: Surely these punishments savour quite as much of severity , and are quite as degrading as flogging .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 34]: The pay of an American private is good -- fourteen dollars a month , out of which his rations and regimentals take eight dollars , leaving him six dollars a month for pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 24]: Deserters are punished by being made to drag a heavy ball and chain after them , which is never removed day or night .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 23]: If discharged , they are flogged , their heads shaved , and they are drummed out at the point of the bayonet .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 57]: From the conversations I have had with many deserters from our army , who were residing in the United States or were in the American service , I am convinced that it would be a very well-judged measure to offer a free pardon to all those who would return to Canada and re-enter the English service .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 50]: I think that a good effective regiment would soon be collected , and one that you might trust on the frontiers without any fear of their deserting again ; and it would have another good effect , that is , that their statements would prevent the desertion of others .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 23]: America , and its supposed freedom , is , to the British soldiers , an Utopia in every sense of the word .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 17]: They revel in the idea ; they seek it and it is not to be found .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 15]: The greatest desertion from the English regiments is among the musicians composing the bands .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 28]: There are so many theatres in America , and so few musicians , except coloured people , that instrumental performers of all kinds are in great demand .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 47]: People are sent over to Canada , and the other British provinces to persuade these poor fellows to desert , promising them very large salaries , and pointing out to them the difference between being a gentleman in America and a slave in the English service .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 35]: The temptation is too strong ; they desert ; and when they strive , they soon learn the value of the promises made to them , and find how cruelly they have been deceived .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 40]: The Florida war has been a source of dreadful vexation and expense to the United States , having already cost them between 20,000,000 and 30,000,000 of dollars , without any apparent prospect of its coming to a satisfactory conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 40]: The American government has also very much injured its character , by the treachery and disregard of honour shown by it to the Indians , who have been , most of them , captured under a flag of truce .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 23]: I have heard so much indignation expressed by the Americans themselves at this conduct that I shall not comment farther upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 20]: It is the Federal government , and not the officers employed , who must bear the _ onus _ .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 17]: But this war has been mortifying , and even dangerous to the Americans in another point .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 9]: It has now lasted three years and more .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 49]: General after general has been superseded , because they have not been able to bring it to a conclusion ; and the Indians have proved , to themselves and to the Americans , that they can defy them when they once get them among the swamps and morasses .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 48]: There has not been one hundred Indians killed , although many of them have been treacherously kidnapped , by a violation of honour ; and it is supposed that the United States have already lost one thousand men , if not more , in this protracted conflict .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 65]: The aggregate force under General Jessup , in Florida , in November , 1837 , was stated to be as follows : -- It is supposed that the number of Indians remaining in Florida do not amount , men , women , and children , to more than 1,500 and General Jessup has declared to the government that the war is _ impracticable _ .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 2]: Militia .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 52]: -- The return of the militia of the United States , for the year 1837 , is as follows : -- The number of _ Militia _ in the several states and territories , according to the statement of George Bomford , Colonel of Ordnance , dated 20th November , 1837 .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 19]: This is an enormous force , but at the commencement of a war not a very effective one .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 39]: In fact , there is no country in the world so defenceless as the United States , but , once roused up , no country more formidable if any -LRB- attempt -RRB- is made to invade its territories .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 36]: At the outbreak of a war , the states have almost everything to provide ; and although the Americans are well adapted as materials for soldiers , still they have to be levied and disciplined .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 85]: At the commencement of hostilities , it is not improbable that a well-organised force of 30,000 men might walk through the whole of the Union , from Maine to Georgia ; but it is almost certain that not one man would ever get back again , as by that time the people would have been roused and excited , armed and sufficiently disciplined ; and their numbers , independent of their bravery , would overwhelm three or four times the number I have mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 69]: Another point must not pass unnoticed , which is , that in America , the major part of which is still an uncleared country , the system of warfare naturally partakes much of the Indian practices of surprise and ambuscade ; and the invaders will always have to labour under the great disadvantage of the Americans having that perfect knowledge of the country which the former have not .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 39]: Most of the defeats of the British troops have been occasioned by this advantage on the part of the Americans , added to the impracticability of the country rendering the superior discipline of the British of no avail .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 32]: Indeed the great advantages of knowing the country were proved by the American attempts to invade Canada during the last war , and which ended in the capitulation of General Hull .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 51]: In an uncleared country , even where large forces meet , each man , to a certain degree , acts independently , taking his position , perhaps , behind a tree -LRB- treeing it , as they term it in America -RRB- , or any other defence which may offer .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 86]: Now , it is evident that , skilled as all the Americans are in fire-arms , and generally using rifles , a disciplined English soldier , with his clumsy musket , fights at a disadvantage ; and , therefore , with due submission to his Grace , the Duke of Wellington was very wrong when he stated , the other day in the House of Lords , that the militia of Canada should be disbanded , and their place supplied by regular troops from England .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 23]: The militia of Upper Canada are quite as good men as the Americans , and can meet them after their own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 54]: A certain proportion of regulars are advantageous , as they are more steady , and in case of a check can be more depended upon ; but it is not once in five times that they will , either in America or Canada , be able to bring their concentrated discipline into play .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 33]: But if the Americans have not the discipline of our troops , their courage is undoubted , and even upon a clear plain the palm of victory will always be severely disputed .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 54]: A Vermonter , surprised for a moment at finding himself in a charge of bayonets , with the English troops , eyed his opponents , and said , `` Well I calculate my piece of iron is as good as _ yourn _ , anyhow , '' and then rushed to the attack .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 23]: People who `` calculate '' in that way are not to be trifled with , as the annals of history fully demonstrate .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 12]: A war between America and England is always to be deprecated .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 40]: Notwithstanding that the countries are severed , still the Americans are our descendants ; they speak the same language , and -LRB- although they do not readily admit it -RRB- still look up to us as their mother country .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 19]: It is true that this feeling is fast wearing away , but still it is not yet effaced .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 46]: It is true also that , in their ambition and their covetousness , they would destroy the mutual advantages derived by both countries from our commercial relations , that they might , by manufacturing as well as producing , secure the whole profits to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 33]: But they are wrong ; for great as America is becoming , the time is not yet arrived when she can compete with English capital , or work for herself without it .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 34]: But there is another reason why a war between the two countries is so much to be deprecated , which is , that is must ever be a cruel and an irritating war .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 17]: To attack the Americans by invasion will always be hazardous , and must ultimately prove disastrous .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 20]: In what manner , then , is England to avenge any aggression that may be committed by the Americans ?
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 38]: All she can do is to ravage , burn , and destroy ; to carry the horrors of war along their whole extended line of coast , distressing the non-combatants , and wreaking vengeance upon the defenceless .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 70]: Dreadful to contemplate as this is , and , even more dreadful the system of stimulating the Indian tribes to join us , adding scalping , and the murdering of women and children , to other horrors , still it is the only method to which England could resort , and , indeed , a method to which she would be warranted to resort , in her own behoof .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 59]: Moreover , in case of a future war , England must not allow it to be of such short duration as was the last ; the Americans must be made to feel it , by its being protracted until their commerce is totally annihilated , and their expenses are increased in proportion with the decrease of their means .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 38]: Let it not be supposed that England would harass the coasts of America , or raise the Indian tribes against her , from any feeling of malevolence , or any pleasure in the sufferings which must ensue .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 76]: It would be from the knowledge of the fact that money is the sinews of war ; and consequently that , by obliging the Americans to call out so large a force as she must do to defend her coast and to repel the Indians , she would be put to such an enormous expense , as would be severely felt throughout the Union , and soon incline all parties to a cessation of hostilities .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 42]: It is to touch their pockets that this plan must and _ will _ be resorted to ; and a war carried on upon that plan alone , would prove a salutary lesson to a young and too ambitious a people .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 114]: Let the Americans recollect the madness of joy with which the hats and caps were thrown up in the air at New York , when , even after so short a war with England , they heard that the treaty of peace had been concluded ; and that too at a time when England was so occupied in a contest , it may be said , with the whole world , that she could hardly divert a portion of her strength to act against America : then let them reflect how sanguinary , how injurious , a protracted war with England would be , when she could direct her whole force against them .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 27]: It is , however , useless to ask a people to reflect who are governed and ruled by the portion who will _ not _ reflect .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 45]: The forbearance must be on our part ; and , for the sake of humanity , it is to be hoped that we shall be magnanimous enough to forbear , for so long as may be consistent with the maintenance of our national honour .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 7]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER FORTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 5]: REMARKS -- AMERICAN MARINE .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 39]: It may be inferred that I naturally directed my attention to everything connected with the American marine , and circumstances eventually induced me to search much more minutely into particulars than at first I had intended to do .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 26]: The present force of the American navy is rated as follows : -- _ Ships of the Line _ _ Frigates , 1st Class _ .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 15]: _ Frigates , 2nd Class _ _ Sloops _ _ Schooners _ NAVY LIST .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 14]: _ Vessels of War of the United States Navy , September 1837 _ .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 52]: _ Ships of the Line _ _ Frigates , 1st Class _ _ Frigates , 2nd Class _ _ Sloops of War _ _ Schooners _ _ Exploring Vessels _ The ratings of these vessels will , however , very much mislead people as to the real strength of the armament .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 37]: The 74 's and 80 's are in weight of broadside equal to most three-decked ships ; the first-class frigates are double-banked of the scantling , and carrying the complement of men of our 74 's .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 18]: The sloops are equally powerful in proportion to their ratings , most of them carrying long guns .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 36]: Although flush vessels , they are little inferior to a 36-gun frigate in scantling , and are much too powerful far any that we have in our service , under the same denomination of rating .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 40]: All the line-of-battle ships are named after the several states , the frigates after the principal rivers , and the sloops of war after the towns , or _ cities _ , and the names are decided by lot .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 17]: It is impossible not to be struck with the beautiful architecture in most of these vessels .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 28]: The Pennsylvania , rated 120 guns , on four decks , carrying 140 , is not by any means so perfect as some of the line-of-battle ships .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 2]: Note .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 48]: The following are the dimensions given me of the ship of the line Pennsylvania : -- Burthen 3366 tons , and has ports for 140 guns , all long thirty-two pounders , throwing 2240 pounds of ball at each broadside , or 4480 pounds from the whole .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 21]: The Ohio is , as far as I am a judge , the perfection of a ship of the line .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 17]: But in every class you can not but admire the superiority of the models and workmanship .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 30]: The dock-yards in America are small , and not equal at present to what may eventually be required , but they have land to add to them if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 38]: There certainly is no necessity for such establishments or such store-houses as we have , as their timber and hemp are at hand when required ; but they ate very deficient both in dry and wet docks .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 10]: Properly speaking , they have no great naval depot .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 12]: This arises from the jealous feeling existing between the several states .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 46]: A bill brought into Congress to expend so many thousand dollars upon the dock-yard at Boston , in Massachusetts , would be immediately opposed by the state of New York , and an amendment proposed to transfer the works intended to their dock-yard at Brooklyn .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 38]: The other states which possess dock-yards would also assert their right , and thus they will all fight for their respective establishments until the bill is lost , and the bone of contention falls to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 15]: The sheet-anchor , made at Washington , weighs 11,660 pounds Main-topsail contains 1,531 yards .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 32]: The number of yards of canvass for one suit of sails is 18,341 , and for bags , hammocks , boat-sails , awnings , etcetera , 14,624 ; total 32,965 yards .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 32]: The Americans considered that in the Pennsylvania they possessed the largest vessel in the world , but this is a great mistake ; one of the Sultan 's three-deckers is larger .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 14]: Below are the dimensions of the Queen , lately launched at Portsmouth Note .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 20]: There are seven navy yards belonging to , and occupied for the use of the United States , viz .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 23]: -- The navy yard at Portsmouth , NH , is situated on an island , contains fifty-eight acres , cost 5,500 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 28]: The navy yard at Charlestown , near Boston , is situated on the north side of Charles river , contains thirty-four acres , and cost 32,214 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 25]: The navy yard at New York is situated on Long Island , opposite New York , contains forty acres , and cost 40,000 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 31]: The navy yard at Philadelphia is situated on the Delaware river , in the district of Southwark , contains eleven acres to low water mark , and cost 27,000 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 36]: It is remarkable that along the whole of the eastern coast of America , from Halifax in Nova Scotia down to Pensacola in the Gulf of Mexico , there is not one good open harbour .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 54]: The majority of the American harbours are barred at the entrance , so as to preclude a fleet running out and in to manoeuvre at pleasure ; indeed , if the tide does not serve , there are few of them in which a line-of-battle ship , hard pressed , could take refuge .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 36]: A good spacious harbour , easy of access , like that of Halifax in Nova Scotia , is one of the few advantages , perhaps the only natural advantage , wanting in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 20]: The American navy list is as follows : -- The pay of these officers is on the following scale .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 33]: It must be observed , that they do not use the term `` half pay ; '' but when unemployed the officers are either attached to the various dockyards or on leave .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 51]: I have reduced the sums paid into English money , that they may be better understood by the reader : The navy yard at Washington , in the district of Columbia , is situated on the eastern branch of the Potomac , contains thirty-seven acres , and cost 4,000 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 29]: In this yard are made all the anchors , cables , blocks , and almost all things requisite for the use of the navy of the United States .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 28]: The navy-yard at Portsmouth , near Norfolk in Virginia , is situated on the south branch of Elizabeth river contains sixteen acres , and cost 13,000 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 23]: There is also a navy-yard at Pensacola in Florida , which is merely used for repairing ships on the West India station .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 28]: It will be perceived by the above list how very much better all classes in the American service are paid in comparison with those in our service .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 32]: But let it not be supposed that this liberality is a matter of choice on the part of the American government ; on the contrary , it is one of necessity .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 19]: There never was , nor never will be , anything like liberality under a democratic form of government .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 35]: The navy is a favourite service , it is true , but the officers of the American navy have not one cent more than they are entitled to , or than they absolutely require .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 96]: In a country like America , where any one may by industry , in a few years , become an independent , if not a wealthy man , it would be impossible for the government to procure officers if they were not tolerably paid ; no parents would permit their children to enter the service unless they were enabled by their allowances to keep up a respectable appearance ; and in America everything , to the annuitant or person not making money , but living upon his income , is much dearer than with us .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 68]: The government , therefore , are obliged to pay them , or young men would not embark in the profession ; for it is not in America as it is with us , where every department is filled up , and no room is left for those who would crowd in ; so that in the eagerness to obtain respectable employment , emolument becomes a secondary consideration .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 47]: It may , however , be worth while to put in juxtaposition the half-pay paid to officers of corresponding ranks in the two navies of England and America : My object in making the comparison between the two services is not to gratify an invidious feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 63]: More expensive as living in America certainly is , still the disproportion is such as must create surprise ; and if it requires such a sum for an American officer to support himself in a creditable and gentlemanlike manner , what can be expected from the English officer with his miserable pittance , which is totally inadequate to his rank and station !
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 26]: Notwithstanding which , our officers do keep up their appearance as gentlemen , and those who have no half pay are obliged to support themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 121]: And I point this out , that when Mr Hume and other gentlemen clamour against the expense of our naval force , they may not be ignorant of one fact , which is , that not only on half-pay , but when on active service , a moiety at least of the expenses necessarily incurred by our officers to support themselves according to their rank , to entertain , and to keep their ships in proper order , is , three times out of four , paid out of their own pockets , or those of their relatives ; and that is always done without complaint , as long as they are not checked in their legitimate claims to promotion .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 18]: In the course of this employment in the Mediterranean , one of our captains was at Palermo .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 19]: The American commodore was there at the time , and the latter gave most sumptuous balls and entertainments .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 51]: Being very intimate with each other , our English captain said to him one day , `` I can not imagine how you can afford to give such parties ; I only know that I can not ; my year 's pay would be all exhausted in a fortnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 50]: `` My dear fellow , '' replied the American commodore , `` do you suppose , that I am so foolish as to go to such an expense , or to spend my pay in this manner ; I have nothing to do with them except to give them .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 39]: My purser provides everything , and keeps a regular account , which I sign as correct , and send home to government , which defrays the whole expenses , under the head of _ conciliation _ money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 87]: I do not mean to say that this is requisite in our service : but still it is not fair to refuse to provide us with paint and other articles , such as leather , etcetera , necessary to fit out our ships ; thus , either compelling us to pay for them out of our own pockets , or allowing the vessels under our command to look like anything but men-of-war , and to be styled , very truly , a disgrace to the service .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 7]: Yet such is the well-known fact .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 63]: And I am informed that the reason why our admiralty will not permit these necessary stores to be supplied is that , as one of the lords of the admiralty was known to say , `` if we _ do not _ provide them , the captains _ most assuredly will _ , therefore let us save the government the expense . ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 34]: During my sojourn in the United States I became acquainted with a large portion of the senior officers of the American navy , and I found them gifted , gentleman-like , and liberal .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 28]: With them I could converse freely upon all points relative to the last war , and always found them ready to admit all that could be expected .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 60]: The American naval officers certainly form a strong contrast to the majority of their countrymen , and prove , by their enlightened and liberal ideas , how much the Americans , in general , would be improved if they enjoyed the same means of comparison with other countries which the naval officers , by their profession , have obtained .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 25]: Their partial successes during the late war were often the theme of discourse , which was conducted with candour and frankness on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 67]: No unpleasant feeling was ever excited by any argument with them on the subject , whilst the question , raised amongst their `` free and enlightened '' brother citizens , who knew nothing of the matter , was certain to bring down upon me such a torrent of bombast , falsehood , and ignorance , as required all my philosophy to submit to with apparent indifference .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 18]: But I must now take my leave of the American navy , and notice their merchant marine .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 22]: Before I went to the United States I was aware that a large proportion of our seamen were in their employ .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 40]: I knew that the whole line of packets , which is very extensive , was manned by British seamen ; but it was not until I arrived in the states that I discovered the real state of the case .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 38]: During my occasional residence at New York , I was surprised to find myself so constantly called upon by English seamen , who had served under me in the different ships I had commanded since the peace .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 30]: Every day seven or eight would come , touch their hats , and remind me in what ships , and in what capacity , they had done their duty .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 28]: I had frequent conversations with them , and soon discovered that their own expression , `` We are all here , sir , '' was strictly true .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 14]: To the why and the wherefore , the answer was invariably the same .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 8]: `` Eighteen dollars a-month , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 54]: Some of them , I recollect , told me that they were going down to New Orleans , because the sickly season was coming on ; and that during the time the yellow fever raged they always had a great advance of wages , receiving sometimes as much as thirty dollars per month .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 39]: I did not attempt to dissuade them from their purpose ; they were just as right to risk their lives from contagion at thirty dollars a-month , as to stand and be fired at a shilling a day .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 70]: The circumstance of so many of my own men being in American ships , and their assertion that there were no other sailors than English at New York , induced me to enter very minutely into my investigation , of which the following are the results : -- The United States , correctly speaking , have no common seamen , or seamen bred up as apprentices before the mast .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 66]: Indeed a little reflection will show how unlikely it is that they ever should have ; for who would submit to such a dog 's life -LRB- as at the best it is -RRB- , or what parent would consent that his children should wear out an existence of hardship and dependence at sea , when he could so easily render them independent on shore ?
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 53]: The same period of time requisite for a man to learn his duty ay an able seaman , and be qualified for the pittance of eighteen dollars per month , would be sufficient to establish a young man as an independent , or even wealthy , land-owner , factor , or merchant .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 90]: That there are classes in America who do go to sea is certain , and who and what these are I shall hereafter point out ; but it may be positively asserted that , unless by escaping from their parents at an early age , and before their education is complete , they become , as it were , lost , there is in the United States of America hardly an instance of a white boy being sent to sea , to be brought up as a foremast man .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 81]: It may be here observed that there is a wide difference in the appearance of an English seaman and a portion of those styling themselves American seamen , who are to be seen at Liverpool and other seaports ; tall , weedy , narrow-shouldered , slovenly , yet still athletic men , with their knives worn in a sheath outside of their clothes , and not with a lanyard round them , as is the usual custom of English seamen .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 93]: There is , I grant , a great difference in their appearance , and it arises from the circumstance of those men having been continually in the trade to New Orleans and the South , where they have picked up the buccaneer airs and customs which are still in existence there ; but the fact is , that , though altered also by climate , the majority of them were Englishmen born , who served their first apprenticeship in the coasting trade , but left it at an early age for America .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 31]: They may be considered as a portion of the emigrants to America , having become in feeling , as well as in other respects , _ bona fide _ Americans .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 60]: The whole amount of tonnage of the American mercantile manner may be taken , in round numbers , at 2,000,000 tons , which may be subdivided as follows : The American merchant vessels are generally sailed with fewer men than the British calculate five men to one hundred tons , which I believe to be about the just proportion .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 33]: Mr Carey , in his work , estimates the proportion of seamen in American vessels to be 44 to every one hundred tons , and I shall assume his calculation as correct .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 46]: The number of men employed in the American mercantile navy will be as follows : -- And now I will submit , from the examinations I have made , the proportions of American and British seamen which are contained in this aggregate of 85,799 men .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 43]: In the foreign trade we have to deduct the masters of the ships , the mates , and the boys who are apprenticed to learn their duty , and rise to mates and masters -LRB- not to serve before the mast -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 48]: These I estimate at : -- which , deducted from 30,333 , will leave 22,333 seamen in the foreign trade ; who , with a slight intermixture of Swedes , Danes , and , more rarely , Americans , may be asserted to be all British seamen .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 34]: The next item is that of the men employed in the whale fishery ; and , as near as I can ascertain the fact , the proportions are two-thirds Americans to one-third British .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 17]: The total is 5,633 ; out of which 3,756 art Americans , and 1,877 British seamen .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 31]: The coasting trade employs 39,000 men ; but only a small proportion of them can be considered as seamen , as _ it _ embraces all the internal river navigation .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 19]: The steam navigation employs 6,500 men , of whom of course not one in ten is a seaman .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 45]: The fisheries for cod and herring employ about 4,333 men ; they are a mixture of Americans , Nova Scotians , and British , but the proportions can not be ascertained ; it is supposed that about one-half are British subjects , i.e. 2,166 .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 44]: When , therefore , I estimate that the Americans employ at least _ thirty thousand of our seamen _ in their service , I do not think , as my subsequent remarks will prove , that I am at all overrating the case .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 43]: The questions which are now to be considered are , the nature of the various branches in which the seamen employed in the American marine are engaged , and how far they will be available to America in case of a war .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 18]: The coasting trade is chiefly composed of sloops , manned by two or three men and boys .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 52]: The captain is invariably part , if not whole , owner of the vessel , and those employed are generally his sons , who work for their father , or some emigrant Irishmen , who , after a few months practice , are fully equal to this sort of fresh-water sailing .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 13]: From the coasting trade , therefore , America would gain no assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 30]: Indeed , the majority of the coasting trade is so confined to the interior , that it would not receive much check from a war with a foreign country .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 27]: The coast fisheries might afford a few seamen , but very few ; certainly not the number of men required to man her ships of war .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 13]: As in the coasting trade , they are mostly owners or partners .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 36]: In the whale fishery much the same system prevails ; it is a common speculation ; and the men embarking stipulate for such a proportion of the fish caught as their share of the profits .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 28]: They are generally well to do , are connected together , and are the least likely of all men to volunteer on board of the American navy .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 11]: They would speculate in privateers , if they did anything .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 13]: From steam navigation , of course , no seamen could be obtained .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 58]: Now , as all service is voluntary , it is evident that the only chance America has of manning her navy is from the thirty thousand British seamen in her employ , the other branches of navigation either not producing seamen , or those employed in them being too independent in situation to serve as foremast men .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 40]: When I was at the different seaports , I made repeated inquiries as to the fact , if ever a lad was sent to sea as foremast-man , and I never could ascertain that it ever was the case .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 72]: Those who are sent as apprentices , are learning their duty to receive the rating of mates , and ultimately fulfil the office of captains ; and it may here be remarked , that many Americans , after serving as captains for a few years , return on shore and become opulent merchants ; the knowledge which they have gained during their maritime career proving of the greatest advantage to them .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 107]: There are a number of free black and coloured lads who are sent to sea , and who , eventually , serve as stewards and cooks ; but it must be observed , that the masters and mates are not people who will enter before the mast and submit to the rigorous discipline of a government vessel , and the cooks and stewards are not seamen ; so that the whale dependence of the American navy , in case of war , is upon the British seamen who are in her foreign trade and whale fisheries , and in her men-of-war in commission during the peace .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 116]: If America brings up none of her people to a seafaring life before the mast , now that her population is upwards of 13,000,000 , still less likely was she to have done it when her population was less , and the openings to wealth by other channels were greater : from whence it may be fairly inferred , that , during our continued struggle with France , when America had the carrying trade in her hands , her vessels were chiefly manned by british seamen ; and that when the war broke out between the two countries , the same British seamen who were in her employ manned her ships of war and privateers .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 16]: It may be surmised that British seamen would refuse to be employed against their country .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 19]: Some might ; but there is no character so devoid of principle as the British sailor and soldier .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 75]: In Dibdin 's songs , we certainly have another version , `` True to his country and king , '' etcetera , but I am afraid they do not deserve it : soldiers and sailors are mercenaries ; they risk their lives for money ; if is their trade to do so ; and if they can get higher wages they never consider the justice of the cause , or whom they fight for .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 76]: Now , America is a country peculiarly favourable for those who have little conscience or reflection ; the same language is spoken there ; the wages are much higher , spirits are much cheaper , and the fear of dejection or punishment is trifling : nay , there is none ; for in five minutes a British seaman may be made a _ bona fide _ American citizen , and of course an American seaman .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 37]: It is not surprising , therefore , that after sailing for years out of the American ports , in American vessels , the men , in case of war , should take the oath and serve .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 63]: It is necessary for any one wanting to become an American citizen , that he should give notice of his intention ; this notice gives him , as soon as he has signed his declaration , all the rights of an American citizen , excepting that of voting at elections , which requires a longer time , as specified in each state .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 73]: The declaration is as follows : -- `` That it is his _ bona fide _ intention to become a citizen of the United States , and to renounce forever all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign power , potentate , state , or sovereignty whatever , and particularly to Victoria , the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland , to whom he is now a subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 42]: Having signed this document , and it being publicly registered , he becomes a citizen , and may be sworn to as such by any captain of merchant vessel or man-of-war , if it be required that he should do so .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 28]: During the last war with America , the Americans hit upon a very good plan as regarded the English seamen whom they had captured in our vessels .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 56]: In the daytime the prison doors were shot and the prisoners were harshly treated ; but at night , the doors were left open : the consequence was , that the prisoners whom they had taken added to their strength , for the men walked out , and entered on board their men-of-war and privateers .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 66]: This fact alone proves that I have not been too severe in my remarks upon the character of the English seamen ; and since our seamen prove to be such `` Dugald Dalgettys , '' it is to be hoped that , should we be so unfortunate as again to come in collision with America , the same plan may be adopted in this country .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 16]: Now , from the above remarks , three points are clearly deducible : -- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 23]: That America always has obtained , and for a long period to come will obtain , her seamen altogether from Great Britain .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 15]: That those seamen can be naturalised immediately , and become American seamen by law .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 85]: That , under present circumstances , England is under the necessity of raising seamen , not only for her own navy , but also for the Americans ; and that , in proportion as the commerce and shipping of America shall increase , so will the demand upon us become more onerous ; and that should we fail in producing the number of seamen necessary for both services , the Americans will always be full manned , whilst any defalcation must fall upon ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 40]: And it may be added that , in all cases , the Americans have the choice and refusal of our men ; and , therefore , they have invariably all the prime and best seamen which we have raised .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 67]: The cause of this is as simple as it is notorious ; it is the difference between the wages paid in the navies and merchant vessels of the two nations : It will be observed , that in the American men-of-war the able-seaman 's pay is only 2 pounds ; the consequence is that they remain for months in port without being able to obtain men .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 87]: But we must now pass by this cause , and look to the origin of it ; or , in other words , how is it that the Americans are able to give such high wages to our seamen as to secure the choice of any number of our best men for their service ; and how is it that they can compete with , and even under-bid , our merchant vessels in freight , at the same time that they sail at a greater expense ?
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 25]: This has arisen partly from circumstances , partly from a series of mismanagement on our part , and partly from the fear of impressment .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 65]: But it is principally to be ascribed to the former peculiarly unscientific mode of calculating the tonnage of our vessels ; the error of which system induced the merchants to build their ships so as to evade the heavy channel and river duties ; disregarding all the first principles of naval architecture , and considering the sailing properties of vessels as of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 10]: The fact is , that we over-taxed our shipping .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 101]: In order to carry as much freight as possible , and , at the same time , to pay as few of the onerous duties , our mercantile shipping generally assumed more the form of floating bores of merchandise than sailing vessels ; and by the false method of measuring the tonnage , they were enabled to carry 600 tons , when , by measurement , they were only taxed as being of the burden of 400 tons : but every increase of tonnage thus surreptitiously obtained , was accompanied with a decrease in the sailing properties of the vessels .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 72]: Circumstances , however , rendered this of less importance during the war , as few vessels ran without the protection of a convoy ; and it must be also observed , that vessels being employed in one trade only , such as the West India , Canada , Mediterranean , etcetera , their voyages during the year were limited , and they were for a certain portion of the year unemployed .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 60]: During the war the fear of impressment was certainly a strong inducement to our seamen to enter into the American vessels , and naturalise themselves as American subjects ; but they were also stimulated even at that period , by the higher wages , as they still are now that the dread of impressment no longer operates upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 66]: It appears , then , that from various causes , our merchant vessels have lost their sailing properties , whilst the Americans are the fastest sailers in the world ; and it is for that reason , and no other , that , although sailing at a much greater expense , the Americans can afford to outbid us , and take all our best seamen .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 20]: An American vessel is in no particular trade , but ready and willing to take freight anywhere when offered .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 84]: She sails so fast that she can make three voyages whilst one of our vessels can make but two : consequently she has the preference , as being the better manned , and giving the quickest return to the merchant ; and as she receives three freights whilst the English vessel receives only two , it is clear that the extra freight wilt more than compensate for the extra expense the vessel sails at in consequence of paying extra wages to the seamen .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 88]: Add to this , that the captains , generally speaking , being better paid , are better informed , and more active men ; that , from having all the picked seamen , they get through their work with fewer hands ; that the activity on board is followed up and supported by an equal activity on the part of the agents and factors on shore -- and you have the true cause why America can afford to pay and secure for herself all our best seamen .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 58]: One thing is evident , that it is a mere question of pounds , shillings , and pence , between us and America , and that the same men who are now in the American service would , if our wages were higher than those offered by America , immediately return to us and leave her destitute .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 34]: That it would be worth the while of this country , in case of a war with the United States , to offer 4 pounds a-head to able seamen , is most certain .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 30]: It would swell the naval estimates , but it would shorten the duration of the war , and in the end would probably be the saving of many millions .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 58]: But the question is , can not and ought not something to be done , now in time of peace , to relieve our mercantile shipping interest , and hold out a bounty for a return to those true principles of naval architecture , the deviation from which has proved to be attended with such serious consequences .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 54]: Fast-sailing vessels will always be able to pay higher wages than others , as what they lose in increase of daily expense , they will gain by the short time in which the voyage is accomplished ; but it is by encouragement alone that we can expect that the change will take place .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 33]: Surely some of the onerous duties imposed by the Trinity House might be removed , not from the present class of vessels , but from those built hereafter with first-rate sailing properties .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 45]: These , however , are points which call for a much fuller investigation than I can here afford them ; but they are of vital importance to our maritime superiority , and as such should be immediately considered by the government of Great Britain .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 7]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER FORTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 4]: REMARKS -- SLAVERY .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 83]: It had always appeared to me as singular that the Americans , at the time of their Declaration of Independence , took no measures for the gradual , if not immediate , extinction of slavery ; that at the very time they were offering up thanks for having successfully struggled for their own emancipation from what they considered foreign bondage , their gratitude for their liberation did not induce them to break the chains of those whom they themselves held in captivity .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 36]: It is useless for them to exclaim , as they now do , that it was England who left them slavery as a curse and reproach us as having originally introduced the system among them .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 51]: Admitting , as is the fact , that slavery did commence when the colonies were subject to the mother country admitting that the petitions for its discontinuance were disregarded , still there was nothing to prevent immediate manumission at the time of the acknowledgement of their independence by Great Britain .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 71]: They had then everything to recommence they had to select a new form of government , and to decide upon new laws ; they pronounced , in their declaration , that `` all men were equal ; '' and yet , in the face of this declaration , and their solemn invocation to the Deity , the negroes , in _ their _ fetters , pleaded to them in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 99]: I had always thought that this sad omission , which has left such an anomaly in the Declaration of Independence as to have made it the taunt and reproach of the Americans by the whole civilised world , did really arise from forgetfulness ; that , as is but too often the case , when we are ourselves made happy , the Americans in their joy at their own deliverance from the foreign yoke , and the repossessing themselves of their own rights , had been too much engrossed to occupy themselves with the undeniable claims of others .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 17]: But I was mistaken ; such was not the case , as I shall presently show .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 71]: In the course of one of my sojourns in Philadelphia , Mr Vaughan , of the Athenium of that city , stated to me that he had found the _ original draft _ of the Declaration of Independence , in the hand-writing of Mr Jefferson , and that it was curious to remark the alterations which had been made previous to the adoption of the manifesto which was afterwards promulgated .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 88]: It was to Jefferson , Adams , and Franklin , that was entrusted the primary drawing up of this important document , which was then submitted to others , and ultimately to the Convention , for approval and it appears that the question of slavery had NOT been overlooked when the document was first framed , as the following clause , inserted in the original draft by Mr Jefferson , -LRB- but _ expunged _ when it was laid before the Convention , -RRB- will sufficiently prove .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 86]: After enumerating the grounds upon which they threw off their allegiance to the king of England , the Declaration continued in Jefferson 's nervous style : `` He -LSB- the king -RSB- has waged cruel war against human nature itself , violating its most sacred rights of _ life and liberty _ , in the person of a distant people who never offended him ; captivating and carrying them into slavery , in another hemisphere , or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 132]: This piratical warfare , the opprobrium of infidel powers , is the warfare of the Christian king of Great Britain , determined to keep open a market where men should be bought and sold ; he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or restrain this execrable commerce ; and that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished dye , he is now exciting these very people to rise in arms among us , and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them , by murdering the people upon whom he also obtruded them ; thus paying off former crimes committed against the liberties of one people , with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another . ''
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 32]: Such was the paragraph which had been inserted by Jefferson , in the virulence of his democracy , and his desire to hold up to detestation the king of Great Britain .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 41]: Such was at that time , unfortunately , the truth ; and had the paragraph remained , and at the same time emancipation been given to the slaves , it would have been a lasting stigma upon George the Third .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 108]: But the paragraph was expunged ; and why I because they could not hold up to public indignation the sovereign whom they had abjured , without reminding the world that slavery still existed in a community which had declared that `` all men were equal ; '' and that if , in a monarch , they had stigmatised it as `` violating the most sacred rights of life and liberty , '' and `` waging cruel war against human nature , '' they could not have afterward been so barefaced and unblushing as to continue a system which was at variance with every principle which they professed .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 2]: Note .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 89]: Miss Martineau , in her admiration of democracy , says , that , in the formation of the government , `` The rule by which they worked was no less than the golden one , which seems to have been , by some unlucky chance , omitted in the Bibles of other statesmen , ` _ Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you _ ' '' I am afraid the American Bible , by some unlucky chance , has also omitted that precept .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 54]: It does , however , satisfactorily prove , that the question of slavery was not _ overlooked _ ; on the contrary , their determination to take advantage of the system was deliberate , and , there can be no doubt , well considered -- the very omission of the paragraph proves it .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 24]: I mention these facts to show that the Americans have no right to revile us on being the cause of slavery in America .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 46]: They had the means , and were bound , as honourable men , to act up to their declaration but they entered into the question , they decided otherwise , and decided that they would retain their ill-acquired property at the expense of their principles .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 20]: The degrees of slavery in America are as various in their intensity as are the communities composing the Union .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 20]: They may , however , be divided with great propriety under two general heads -- eastern and western slavery .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 66]: By eastern slavery , I refer to that in the slave states bordering on the Atlantic , and those slave states on the other side of the Alleghany mountains , which may be more directly considered as their colonies , viz , in the first instance , Maryland , Delaware , Virginia , North and South Carolina ; and , secondly , Kentucky and Tennessee .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 31]: We have been accustomed lately to class the slaves as non-predial and predial , -- that is , those who are domestic , and those who work on the plantations .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 25]: This classification is not correct , if it is intended to distinguish between those who are well , and those who are badly treated .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 27]: The true line to be drawn is between those who work separately , and those who are worked in a gang and superintended by an overseer .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 39]: This is fully exemplified in the United States , where it will be found that in all states where they are worked in gangs the slaves are harshly treated , while in the others their labour is light .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 79]: Now , with the exception of the rice grounds in South Carolina , the eastern states are growers of corn , hemp , and tobacco ; but their chief staple is the breeding of horses , mules , horned cattle , and other stock : the largest portion of these states remain in wild luxuriant pasture , more especially in Virginia , Kentucky , and Tennessee , either of which states is larger than the other four mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 68]: The proportion of slaves required for the cultivation of the purely agricultural and chiefly grazing farms or plantations in these states is small , fifteen or twenty being sufficient for a farm of two hundred or three hundred acres ; and their labour , which is mostly confined to tending stock , is not only very light , but of the quality most agreeable to the negro .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 29]: Half the day you will see him on horseback with his legs idly swinging -- as he goes along , or seated on a shaft-horse driving his wagons .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 29]: He is quite in his glory ; nothing delights a negro so much as riding or driving , particularly when he has a whole team under his control .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 53]: He takes his wagon for a load of corn to feed the hogs , sits on the edge of the shaft as he tosses the cobs to the grunting multitude , whom he addresses in the most intimate terms ; in short , everything is done leisurely , after his own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 77]: In these grazing states , as they may very properly be called , the negroes are well fed ; they refuse beef and mutton , and will have nothing but pork ; and are , without exception , the fattest and most saucy fellows I ever met with in a state of bondage ; and such may be said generally to be the case with all the negroes in the eastern states which I have mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 17]: The rice grounds in South Carolina are unhealthy , but the slaves are very kindly treated .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 7]: But the facts speak for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 45]: When the negro works in a gang with the whip over him , he may be overworked and ill-treated ; but when he is not regularly watched , he will take very good care that the work he performs shall not injure his constitution .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 27]: It has been asserted , and generally credited , that in the eastern states negroes are regularly bred up like the cattle for the western market .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 70]: That the Virginians , and the inhabitants of the other eastern slave states , do sell negroes which are taken to the west , there is no doubt ; but that the negroes are bred expressly for that purpose , is , as regards the majority of the proprietors , far from the fact : it is the effect of circumstances , over which they have had no control .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 72]: Virginia , when first settled , was one of the richest states , but , by continually cropping the land without manuring it , and that for nearly two hundred years , the major portion of many valuable estates has become barren , and the land is no longer under cultivation ; in consequence of this , the negroes , -LRB- increasing so rapidly as they do in that country . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 30]: so far from being profitable , have become a serious task upon their masters , who have to rear and maintain , without having any employment to give them .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 39]: The small portion of the estates under cultivation will subsist only a certain portion of the negroes ; the remainder must , therefore , be disposed of , or they would eat their master out of his home .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 31]: That the slaves are not willingly disposed of by many of the proprietors I am certain , particularly when it is known , that they are purchased for the west .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 54]: I know of many instances of this , and wins informed of others ; and by wills , especially , slaves have been directed to be sold for _ two-thirds _ of the price which they would fetch for the western market , on condition that they were not to leave the state .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 33]: These facts establish two points , viz , that the slaves in the eastern states is well treated , and that in the western states slavery still exists with all its horrors .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 29]: The common threat to , and ultimate punishment of , a refractory and disobedient slave in the east , is to sell , him for the western market .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 42]: Many slave proprietors , whose estates have been worn out in the east , have preferred migrating to the west with their slaves rather than sell them , and thus is the severity of the western treatment occasionally and partially mitigated .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 83]: But doing justice , as I always will , to those who have been unjustly calumniated , at the same time I must admit that there is a point connected with slavery in America which renders it more odious than in other countries ; I refer to the system of amalgamation , which has , from promiscuous intercourse , been carried on to such an extent , that you very often meet with slaves whose skins are whiter than their master 's .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 51]: At Louisville , Kentucky , I saw a girl , about twelve years old , carrying a child ; and , aware that in a slave state the circumstance of white people hiring themselves out to service is almost unknown , I inquired of her if she were a slave .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 10]: To my astonishment , she replied in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 32]: She was as fair as snow , and it was impossible to detect any admixture of blood from her appearance , which was that of a pretty English cottager 's child .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 23]: I afterward spoke to the master , who stated when he had purchased her , and the sum which he had paid .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 30]: I took down the following advertisement for a runaway slave , which was posted up in every tavern I stopped at in Virginia on my way to the springs .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 36]: The expression of , '' _ in a manner white _ '' would imply that there was some shame felt it holding a white man in bondage : -- '' _ Fifty Dollars Reward _ .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 110]: `` Ran away from the subscriber , on Saturday , the 21st instant , a slave named George , between twenty and twenty-four years of age , five feet five or six inches high , slender made , stoops when standing , a little bow legged ; generally wears right and left boots and shoes ; had on him when he left a fur cap , a checked stock , and linen roundabout ; had with him other clothing , a jean coat with black horn buttons , a pair of jean pantaloons , both coat and pantaloons of handsome grey mixed ; no doubt other clothing not recollected .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 20]: He had with him a common silver watch ; he wears his pantaloons generally very tight in the legs .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 25]: _ Said boy _ is in a manner _ white _ , would be passed by _ and taken for a white man _ .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 48]: His _ hair _ is _ long and straight _ , like that of a _ white _ person ; looks very steady when spoken to , speaks slowly , and would not be likely to look a person full in the face when speaking to him .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 15]: It is believed he is making his way to Canada by way of Ohio .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 36]: I will give twenty dollars for the apprehension of said slave if taken in the county , or fifty dollars if taken out of the county , and secured so that I recover him again .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 17]: `` Andrew Beirne , junior , `` Union Monroe City , `` July 31st , 1838 .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 3]: Virginia . ''
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 28]: The above is a curious document , independently of its proving the manner in which man preys upon his fellow-man in this land of liberty and equality .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 20]: It is a well-known fact , that a considerable portion of Mr Jefferson 's slaves were his own children .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 123]: If any of them absconded , he would smile , thereby implying that he should not be very particular in looking after them ; and yet this man , this great and _ good _ man , as Miss Martineau calls him , this man who penned the paragraph I have quoted , as having been erased from the Declaration of Independence , who asserted that the slavery of the negro was a violation of the most sacred rights of life and liberty , permitted these his slaves and his children , the issue of his own loins , to be sold at auction after his demise , not even emancipating them , as he might have done , before his death .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 81]: And , but lately , a member of congress for Georgia , whose name I shall not mention , brought up a fine family of children , his own issue by a female slave ; for many years acknowledged them us his own children ; permitted them to call him by the endearing title of _ papa _ , and eventually the whole of them were sold by public auction , and that , too , during his own lifetime !
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 21]: But there is , I am sorry to say , a more horrible instance on record and one well authenticated .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 71]: A planter of good family -LRB- I shall not mention his name or the state in which it occurred , as he was not so much to blame as were the laws -RRB- , connected himself with one of his own female slaves , who was nearly white ; the fruits of this connexion were two daughters , very beautiful girls , who were sent to England to be educated .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 10]: They were both grown up when their father died .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 27]: At his death his affairs were found in a state of great disorder ; in fact , there was not sufficient left to pay his creditors .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 40]: Having brought up and educated these two girls and introduced them as his daughters , it quite slipped his memory that , having been born of a slave , and not manumitted , they were in reality slaves themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 112]: This fact was established after his decease ; they were torn away from the affluence and refinement to which they had been accustomed , sold and purchased as slaves , and with the avowed intention of the purchaser to reap his profits from their prostitution it must not , however , be supposed that the planters of Virginia and the other Eastern states , encourage this intercourse ; on the contrary , the young men who visit at the plantations can not affront them more than to take notice of their slaves , particularly the lighter coloured , who are retained in the house and attend upon their wives and daughters .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 96]: Independently of the moral feeling which really guides them -LRB- as they naturally do not wish that the attendants of their daughters should be degraded -RRB- it is against their interest in case they should wish to sell ; as a mulatto or light male will not fetch so high a price as a full-blooded negro ; the cross between the European and negro ; especially the first cross , i.e. the mulatto , is of a sickly constitution , and quite unable to bear up against the fatigue of field labour in the West .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 13]: As the race becomes whiter , the stamina is said to improve .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 30]: Examining into the question of emancipation in America , the first inquiry will be , how far this consummation is likely to be effected by means of the abolitionists .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 21]: Miss Martineau , in her book , says , `` The good work has begun , and will proceed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 41]: She is so far right ; it has begun , and has been progressing very fast , as may be proved by the single fact of the abolitionists having decided the election in the state of Ohio in October last .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 32]: But let not Miss Martineau exult ; for the stronger the abolition party may become , the more danger is there to be apprehended of a disastrous conflict between the states .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 52]: The fact is that , by the constitution of the United States , the federal government have not only no power to _ interfere _ or to _ abolish _ slavery , but they are bound to _ maintain _ it ; the abolition of slavery is expressly _ withheld _ .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 29]: The citizens of any state may abolish slavery in their own state but the federal government can not do so without an express violation of the federal compact .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 47]: Should all the states in the Union abolish slavery , with the exception of one , and that one be Maryland , -LRB- the smallest of the whole of the states , -RRB- neither the federal government , or the other states could interfere with her .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 64]: The federal compact binds the general government , `` first , not to _ meddle _ with the slavery of the states where it exists , and next , to _ protect _ it in the case of runaway slaves , and to _ defend _ it in case of _ invasion _ or _ domestic violence _ on account of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 51]: It appears , therefore , that slavery can only be abolished by the slave state itself in which it exists ; and it is not very probable that any class of people will voluntarily make themselves beggars by surrendering up their whole property to satisfy the clamour of a party .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 31]: That this party is strong , and is daily becoming stronger , is very true : the stronger it becomes the worse will be the prospects of the United States .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 56]: In England the case was very different ; the government had a right to make the sacrifice to public opinion by indemnification to the slave-holders ; but in America the government have not that power ; and the efforts of the abolitionists will only have the effects of plunging the country into difficulties and disunion .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 42]: As an American author truly observes , `` The American abolitionists must trample on the constitution , and wade through the carnage of a civil war , before they can triumph -- '' Already the abolition party have done much mischief .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 36]: The same author observes , `` The South has been compelled , in self-defence , to rivet the chains of slavery afresh , and to hold on to their political rights with a stronger hand .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 165]: The conduct of the abolitionists has arrested the improvements which were in progress in the slave states for the amelioration of the condition of the slave ; it has broken up the system of intellectual and moral culture that was extensively in operation for the slave 's benefit , lest the increase of his knowledge should lend him a dangerous power , in connection with these crusading efforts ; it has rivetted the chains of slavery with a greatly increased power , and enforced a more rigorous discipline ; it has excluded for the time being the happy moral influence which was previously operating on the South from the North , and from the rest of the world , by the lights of comparison , by the interchange of a friendly intercourse , and by a friendly discussion of the great subject , all tending to the bettering of the slave 's condition , and , as was supposed , to his ultimate emancipation .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 36]: Before this agitation commenced , this subject , in all its aspects and bearings , might be discussed as freely at the South as anywhere ; but now , not a word can be said .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 45]: It has kindled a sleepless jealousy in the South toward the North , and made the slave-holders feel as if all the rest of the world were their enemies , and that they must depend upon themselves for the maintenance of their political rights .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 39]: We say rights , because they regard them as such ; and so long as they do so , it is all the same in their feelings , whether the rest of the world acknowledge them or not .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 24]: And they are , in fact , _ political _ rights , guaranteed to them by the constitution of the United States . ''
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 29]: It is not , however , impossible that the abolition party in the Eastern and Northern states may be gradually checked by the citizens of those very states .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 28]: Their zeal may be as warm as ever ; but public opinion will compel them , at the risk of their lives , to hold their tongues .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 26]: This possibility can , however , only arise from the Northern and Eastern states becoming manufacturing states , as they are most anxious to be .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 61]: Should this happen , the raw cotton grown by slave labour will employ the looms of Massachusetts ; and then , as the Quarterly Review very correctly observes , `` by a cycle of commercial benefits , the Northern and Eastern states will feel that there is some material compensation for the moral turpitude of the system of slavery . ''
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 50]: The slave proprietors in these states are as well aware as any political economist can be , that slavery is a loss instead of a gain , and that no state can arrive at that degree of prosperity under a state of slavery which it would under free labour .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 5]: The case is simple .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 41]: In free labour , where there is competition , you exact the greatest possible returns for the least possible expenditure ; a man is worked as a machine ; he is paid for what he produces , and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 37]: By slave labour , you receive the least possible return for the greatest possible expense , for the slave is better fed and clothed than the freeman , and does as little work as he can .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 53]: The slave-holders in the eastern states are well aware of this , and are as anxious to be rid of slavery as are the abolitionists ; but the time is not yet come , nor will it come until the country shall have so filled up as to render white labour attainable .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 87]: Such , indeed , are not the expectations expressed in the language of the representatives of their states when in congress ; but , it must be remembered , that this is a question which has convulsed the Union , and that , not only from a feeling of pride , added to indignation at the interference , but from if feeling of the necessity of not yielding up one tittle upon this question , the language of determined resistance is in congress invariably resorted to .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 47]: But these gentlemen have one opinion for congress , and another for their private table ; in the first , they stand up unflinchingly for their slave rights ; in the other , they reason calmly , and admit what they could not admit in public .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 50]: There is no labour in the eastern states , excepting that of the rice plantations in South Carolina , which can not be performed by white men ; indeed , a large proportion of the cotton in the Carolinas is now raised by a _ free white _ population .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 25]: In the grazing portion of these states , white labour would be substituted advantageously , could white labour be procured at any reasonable price .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 79]: The time will come , and I do not think it very distant , say perhaps twenty or thirty years , when , provided America receives no check , and these states are not injudiciously interfered with , that Virginia , Kentucky , Delaware , Maryland , North Carolina , -LRB- and , eventually , but probably somewhat later , Tennessee and South Carolina -RRB- will , of their own accord , enrol themselves among the free states .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 101]: As a proof that in the eastern slave states the negro is not held in such contempt , or justice toward him so much disregarded , I extract the following from an American work : -- `` An instance of the force of law in the southern states for the protection of the slave has just occurred , in the failure of a petition to his excellency , PM Butler , governor of South Carolina , for the pardon of Nazareth Allen , a white person , convicted of the murder of a slave , and sentenced to be hung .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 85]: The following is part of the answer of the governor to the petitioners : -- '' ` The laws of South Carolina make no distinction in cases of deliberate murder , whether committed on a black man or a white man ; neither can I. I am not a law-maker , but the executive officer of the laws already made ; and I must not act on a distinction which the legislature might have made , but has not thought fit to make . '
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 37]: `` That the crime of which the prisoner stands convicted was committed against one of an inferior grade in society , is a reason for being especially cautious in intercepting the just severity of the law .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 18]: This class of our population are subjected to us as well for their protection as our advantage .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 48]: Our rights , in regard to them , are not more imperative than their duties ; and the institutions , which for wise and necessary ends have rendered them peculiarly dependent , at least pledge the law to be to them peculiarly a friend and a protector .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 10]: `` The prayer of the petition is not granted .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 6]: `` Pierce M Butler . ''
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 47]: In the western states , comprehending Missouri , Louisiana , Arkansas , Mississippi , Georgia , and Alabama , the negroes are , with the exception perhaps of the two latter States , in a worse condition than they ever were in the West India islands .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 93]: This may be easily imagined , when the character of the white people who inhabit the larger portion of these states is considered a class of people , the majority of whom are without feelings of honour , reckless in their habits , intemperate , unprincipled , and lawless , many of them having fled from the eastern states , as fraudulent bankrupts , swindlers , or committers of other crimes , which have subjected them to the penitentiaries -- miscreants defying the climate , so that they can defy the laws .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 29]: Still this representation of the character of the people inhabiting these states must , from the chaotic state of society in America , be received with many exceptions .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 30]: In the city of New Orleans , for instance , and in Natchez and its vicinity , and also among the planters , there are many most honourable exceptions .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 24]: I have said the majority : for we must look to the _ mass _ -- the exceptions do but prove the rule .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 30]: It is evident that slaves , under such masters , can have but little chance of good treatment , and stories are told of them at which humanity shudders .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 61]: It appears , then , that the slaves , with the rest of the population of America , are _ working their way west _ , and the question may now be asked : -- Allowing that slavery will be soon abolished in the eastern states , what prospect is there of its ultimate abolition and total extinction in America ?
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 53]: I can see no prospect of exchanging slave labour for free in the western states , as , with the exception of Missouri , I do not think it possible that white labour could be substituted , the extreme heat and unhealthiness of the climate being a bar to any such attempt .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 24]: The cultivation of the land must be carried on by a negro population , if it is to be carried on at all .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 28]: The question , therefore , to be considered is , whether these states are to be inhabited and cultivated by a free or a slave negro population .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 42]: It must be remembered , that not one-twentieth part of the land in the southern states is under cultivation ; every year , as the slates are brought in from the east , the number of acres taken into cultivation increases .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 27]: Not double or triple the number of the slaves at present in America would be sufficient for the cultivation of the whole of these vast territories .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 88]: Every year the cotton crops increase , and at the same time the price of cotton has not materially lowered ; as an everywhere increasing population takes off the whole supply , this will probably continue to be the case for many years , since it must be remembered , that , independently of the increasing population increasing the demand , cotton , from its comparative cheapness , continually usurps the place of some other raw material ; this , of course , adds to the consumption .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 107]: In various manufactures , cotton has already taken the place of linen and fur ; but there must eventually be a limit to consumption : and this is certain , that as soon as the supply is so great as to exceed the demand , the price will be lowered by the competition ; and , as soon as the price is by competition so lowered as to render the cost and keeping of the slave greater than the income returned by his labour , then , and not till then , is there any chance of slavery being abolished in the western states of America .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 4]: See Note 4 .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 44]: The probability of this consummation being brought about sooner is in the expectation that the Brazils , Mexico , and particularly the independent State of Texas , will in a few years produce a crop of cotton which may considerably lower its price .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 33]: At present , the United States grow nearly , if not more , than half of the cotton produced in the whole world , as the return down to 1831 will substantiate .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 23]: Cotton grown all over the world in the years 1821 and 1831 ; showing the increase in each country in ten years .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 17]: The increase of cotton grown all over the world in ten years is therefore 190,000,000 lbs .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 15]: Brazil has only increased 6,000,000 ; Egypt has increased 12,000,000 ; India , 5,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 37]: Africa , West indies , South America , Asia , have all fallen off ; but the defalcation has been made good by the United States , which have increased their growth by 205,000,000 of lbs .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 36]: In the Southern portion of America there are millions of acres on which cotton can be successfully cultivated , particularly Texas , the soil of which is so congenial that they can produce 1,000 lb .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 5]: to the 400 lb .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 24]: raised by the Americans ; and the quality of the Texian cotton is said to be equal to the finest sea island produce .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 64]: It is to Texas particularly that we must look for this produce , as it can there be raised by white labour ; -LSB- see Note -RSB- and being so produced , will , as soon as its population in creases to a certain extent , be able to under sell that which is grown in America by the labour of the slave .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 16]: Increase of cotton grown in the United States , from the year 1802 to 1831 .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 24]: It may be asked : how is it , as Texas is so far south , that a white population can labour there ?
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 20]: It is because Texas is a prairie country , and situated at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 27]: A sea-breeze always blows across the whole of the country , rendering it cool , and refreshing it notwithstanding the power of the sun 's rays .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 16]: This breeze is apparently a continuation of the trade-winds following the course of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 34]: From circumstances , therefore , Texas , which but a few years since was hardly known as a country , becomes a state of the greatest importance to the civilised and moral world .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 19]: I am not in this chapter about to raise the question how Texas has been ravished from Mexico .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 49]: Miss Martineau , with all her admiration of democracy , admits it to have been `` the most _ high-handed _ theft of modern times ; '' and the letter of the celebrated Dr Charming to Mr Clay has laid bare to the world the whole nefarious transaction .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 26]: In this letter Dr Charming points out the cause of the seizure of Texas , and the wish to enrol it among the federal states .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 72]: `` Mexico , at the moment of throwing off the Spanish yoke , gave a noble testimony of her loyalty to free principles , by decreeing ` That no person thereafter should be born a slave , or introduced as such into the Mexican states ; that all slaves then held should receive stipulated wages , and be subject to no punishment but on trial and judgment by the magistrate . '
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 13]: The subsequent acts of the government fully carried out these constitutional provisions .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 42]: It is matter of deep grief and humiliation , that the emigrants from this country , while boasting of superior civilisation , refused to second this honourable policy , intended to set limits to one of the greatest of social evils .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 15]: Slaves come into Texas with their masters from the neighbouring states of this country .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 68]: One mode of evading the laws was , to introduce slaves under formal indentures for long periods , in some cases , it is said , for ninety-nine years ; but by a decree of the state legislature of Coahuila and Texas , all indentures for a longer period than ten years were annulled , and provision was made for the freedom of children during this apprenticeship .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 26]: This settled , invincible purpose of Mexico to exclude slavery from her limits , created as strong a purpose to annihilate her authority in Texas .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 70]: By this prohibition , Texas was virtually shut against emigration from the southern and western portions of this country ; and it is well known that the eyes of the south and west had for some time been turned to this province as a new market for slaves , as a new field for slave labour , and as a vast accession of political power to the slave-holding states .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 24]: That such views were prevalent we know ; for , nefarious as they are , they found their way into the public prints .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 44]: The project of dismembering a neighbouring republic , that slaveholders and slaves might overspread a region which had been consecrated to a free population , was discussed in newspapers as coolly as if it were a matter of obvious right and unquestionable humanity .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 15]: A powerful interest was thus created for severing from Mexico her distant province . ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 148]: The fact is this : -- America , -LRB- for the government looked on and offered no interruption , -RRB- has seized upon Texas , with a view of extending the curse of slavery , and of finding a mart for the excess of her negro population : if Texas is admitted into the Union , all chance of the abolition of slavery must be thrown forward to such an indefinite period , as to be lost in the mist of futurity ; if , on the contrary , Texas remains an independent province , or is restored to its legitimate owners , and in either case slavery is abolished , she then becomes , from the very circumstance of her fertility and aptitude for white labour , not only the great _ check to slavery _ , but eventually the means of its _ abolition _ .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 22]: Never , therefore , was there a portion of the globe upon which the moral world must look with such interest .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 32]: England may , if she acts promptly and wisely , make such terms with this young state as to raise it up as a barrier against the profligate ambition of America .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 141]: Texas was a portion of Mexico , and Mexico abolished slavery ; the Texians are bound -LRB- if they are _ Texians _ and not Americans -RRB- to adhere to what might be considered a treaty with the whole Christian world ; if not , they can make no demand upon its sympathy or protection , and it should be a _ sine qua non _ with England and all other European powers previous to acknowledging or entering into commercial relations with Texas , that she should adhere to the law which was passed at the time that she was an integral portion of Mexico , and declare herself to be a Free State -- if she does not , unless the chains are broken by the negro himself , the cause and hopes of _ emancipation _ are lost .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 73]: There certainly is one outlet for the slaves , which as they are removed thither and farther to the west will eventually be offered : -- that of escaping to the Indian tribes which are spread over the western frontier , and amalgamating with them ; such indeed , I think , will some future day be the result , whether they gain their liberty by desertion , insurrection , or manumission .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 10]: Of insurrection there is at present but little fear .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 41]: In the eastern slave states , the negroes do not think of it , and if they did , the difficulty of combination and of procuring arms is so great , that it would be attended with very partial success .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 37]: The intervention of a foreign power might indeed bring it to pass , but it is to be hoped that England , at all events , will never be the party to foment a servile war .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 63]: Let us not forget that for more than two centuries we have been _ particeps criminis _ , and should have been in as great a difficulty as the Americans now are , had we had the negro population on our own soil , and not on distant islands which could be legislated for without affecting the condition of the mother country .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 44]: Nay , at this very moment , by taking nearly the whole of the American cotton off their hands in exchange for our manufactures , we are ourselves virtually encouraging slavery by affording the Americans such a profitable mart for their slave labour .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 33]: There is one point to which I have not yet adverted , which is , Whether the question of emancipation is likely to produce a separation between the Northern and Southern states ?
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 28]: The only reply that can be given is , that it entirely depends upon whether the abolition party can be held in check by the federal government .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 45]: That the federal government will do its utmost there can be no doubt , but the federal government is not so powerful as many of the societies formed in America , and especially the Abolition Society , which every day adds to its members .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 22]: The interests of the North are certainly at variance with the measures of the society , yet still it gains strength .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 30]: The last proceedings in congress show that the federal government is aware of its rapid extension , and are determined to do all in its power to suppress it .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 18]: The following are a portion of the resolutions which were passed last year by an overwhelming majority .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 197]: The first resolution was ; `` That the government is of limited powers , and that by the constitution of the United States , congress has no jurisdiction whatever over the institution of slavery in the several states of the confederacy ; '' the last was as follows : `` Resolved , therefore , that all attempts on the part of congress to _ abolish slavery _ in the district of Columbia , or the territories , or to prohibit the removal of the slaves from state to state ; or to discriminate between the constitution of one portions of the confederacy and another , with the views aforesaid , are in _ violation _ of the constitutional principles on which the _ union _ of these States rests , and beyond the jurisdiction of congress ; and that every petition , memorial , resolution , proposition , or paper touching or relating in any way or to any extent whatever to slavery as aforesaid , or the abolition thereof , shall without any farther action thereon , be laid on the table , without _ printing , reading , debate , or reference _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 10]: Question put , `` Shall the resolutions pass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 12]: Yeas , 198 ; Noes , 6 -- _ Examiner _ .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 44]: These resolutions are very firm and decided , but in England people have no idea of the fanaticism displayed and excitement created in these societies , which are a peculiar feature in the states , and arising from the nature of their institutions .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 28]: Their strength and perseverance are such that they bear down all before them , and , regardless of all consequences , they may eventually control the government .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 31]: As to the question which portion of the States will be the losers by a separation , I myself think that it will be the northern slates which will suffer .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 34]: But as I always refer to American authority when I can , I had better give the reader a portion of a letter written by one of the southern gentlemen on this subject .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 87]: In a letter to the editor of the _ National Gazette _ , Mr Cooper , after referring to a point at issue with the abolitionists , not necessary to introduce here , says -- `` I shall therefore briefly touch upon the subject once more ; and if farther provocation is given , I may possibly enter into more details hereafter ; for the present I desire to hint at some items of calculation of the value of the Union _ to the North _ .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 3]: `` 1 .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 51]: Mr Rhett , in his bold and honest address , has stated that the expenditures of the government for twenty years , ending 1836 , have been four hundred and twenty millions of dollars ; of which one hundred and thirty were dedicated to the payment of the national debt .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 23]: Of the remainder , two hundred and ten millions were expended in the northern , and eighty millions in the southern states .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 32]: Suppose this Union to be severed , I rather guess the government expenditure of what is now about fifteen millions a-year to the North , would be an item reluctantly spared .

Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 9]: I beg permission to address New York especially .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 24]: In the year 1836 our exports were one hundred and sixteen millions of dollars , and our imports one hundred and forty millions .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 19]: It is not too much to assign seventy-five millions of these imports to the state of New York .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 17]: The South furnishes on an average two-thirds of the whole value of the _ exports _ .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 28]: It is fair , therefore , to say , that two-thirds of the _ imports _ are consumed in the South , that is , fifty millions .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 33]: The mercantile profit on fifty millions of merchandise , added to the agency and factorage of the Southern products transmitted to pay for them , will be at least twenty per cent .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 33]: That is , New York is gainer by the South , of at least ten millions of dollars annually ; for the traffic is not likely to decrease after the present year .

Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 20]: What supports the shipping of the North but her commerce ; and of her commerce two-thirds is Southern commerce .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 41]: Nor is her _ commerce _ in any manner or degree _ necessary _ to the South ; _ Europe _ manufactures what the _ South wants _ , and the _ South _ raises what Europe _ wants _ .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 32]: Between Europe and the South there is not and can not be any competition , for there is no commercial or manufacturing , of territorial interference to excite jealousies between them .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 6]: We want not the North .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 14]: _ We can do without the North _ , if we separate to-morrow .

Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 13]: The North seems to have a strange inclination to quarrel with England .

Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 25]: The manufacturing and commercial interferences of the north with Europe will always remain a possible , if not a probable , source of disputes .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 48]: The _ North _ raises what _ Europe _ raises ; commercially they need not each other -- they are two of a trade , they raise not what each other wants -- they are _ rivals _ and _ competitors _ when they go to war .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 33]: Does not the South , who is not interested in it , pay most part of the expense , and is not the war expenditure applied to the benefit of the North ?

Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 28]: I ask of these gentlemen , does not at least one-third of the labour produce of every Southern slave ultimately lodge in the purse of the North !

Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 10]: With such men what valid compact can be made ?
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 24]: The appeal must be to those who think that a deliberate compact is mutually binding on parties of any and every religious creed .

Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 7]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER FORTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 6]: REMARKS -- RELIGION IN AMERICA .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 38]: In theory nothing appears more rational than that every one should worship the Deity according to his own ideas -- form his own opinion as to his attributes , and draw his own conclusions as to hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 63]: An established Church _ appears _ to be a species of coercion , not that you are obliged to believe in , or follow that form of worship , but that , if you do not , you lose your portion of certain advantages attending that form of religion , which has been accepted by the majority and adopted by the government .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 24]: In religion , to think for yourself wears the semblance of a luxury , and like other luxuries , it is proportionably taxed .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 102]: And yet it would appear as if it never were intended that the mass should think for themselves , as everything goes on so quietly when other people think for them , and everything goes so wrong when they do think for themselves : in the first instance where a portion of the people think for the mass , all are of one opinion ; whereas in the second , they divide and split into many molecules , that they resemble the globules of water when expanded by heat , and like them are in a state of restlessness and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 36]: That the partiality shown to an established church creates some bitterness of feeling is most true , but being established by law , is it not the partiality shown for the legitimate over the illegitimate ?
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 36]: All who choose may enter into its portals , and if the people will remain out of doors of their own accord , ought they to complain that they have no house over their heads .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 26]: They certainly have a right to remain out of doors if they please , but whether they are justified in complaining afterward is another question .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 35]: Perhaps the unreasonableness of the demands of the dissenters in our own country will be better brought home to them by my pointing out the effects of the voluntary system in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 27]: In America every one worships the Deity after his own fashion ; not only the mode of worship , but even the Deity itself , varies .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 44]: Some worship God , some Mammon ; some admit , some deny , Christ ; some deny both God and Christ ; some are saved by living prophets only ; some go to heaven by water , while some dance their way upwards .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 13]: Numerous as are the sects , still are the sects much subdivided .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 57]: Unitarians are not in unity as to the portion of divinity they shall admit to our Saviour ; flap-fists , as to the precise quantity of water necessary to salvation ; even the Quakers have split into controversy , and the men of peace are at open war in Philadelphia , the city of brotherly love .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 42]: The following is the table of the religious denominations of the United States , from the American Almanac of 1838 : TABLE OF THE RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES In this list many varieties of sects are blended into one .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 30]: For instance , the Baptists , who are divided ; also the Friends , who have been separated into Orthodox and Hicksite , the Camelites , etcetera , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 27]: But it is not worth while to enter into a detail of the numerous minor sects , or we might add Deists , Atheists , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 15]: -- for even _ no _ religion is a species of _ creed _ .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 65]: It must be observed , that , according to this table , out of the whole population of the United States , there are only 1,983,905 , -LRB- with the exception of the Catholics , who are Communicants , -RRB- that is , who have openly professed any creed ; the numbers put down as the population of the different creeds are wholly suppositions .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 12]: How can it be otherwise , when people have not professed ?
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 40]: It is computed , that in the census of 1840 the population of the States will have increased to 18,000,000 , so that it may be said that only one ninth portion have professed and openly avowed themselves Christians .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 52]: Religion may , as to its consequences , be considered under two heads : as it affects the future welfare of the individual when he is summoned to the presence of the Deity , and as it affects society in general , by acting upon the moral character of the community .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 61]: Now , admitting the right of every individual to decide whether he will follow the usual beaten track , or select for himself a by-path for his journey upward , it must be acknowledged that the results of this free-will are , in a moral point of view , as far as society is concerned , any thing but satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 53]: It would appear as if the majority were much too frail and weak to go alone upon their heavenly journey ; as if they required the support , the assistance , the encouragement , the leaning upon others who are journeying with them , to enable them successfully to gain the goal .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 34]: The effects of an established church are to cement the mass , cement society and communities , and increase the force of those natural ties by which families and relations are bound together .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 30]: There is an attraction of cohesion in an uniform religious worship , acting favourably upon the morals of the mass , and binding still more closely those already united .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 64]: Now , the voluntary system in America has produced the very opposite effects ; it has broken one of the strongest links between man and man , for each goeth his own way : as a nation , there is no national feeling to be acted upon ; in society , there is something wanting , and you ask yourself what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 67]: and in families it often creates disunion : I know one among many others , who , instead of going together to the same house of prayer , disperse as soon as they are out of the door : one daughter to an Unitarian chapel , another to a Baptist , the parents to the Episcopal , the sons , any where , or no where .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 77]: But worse effects are produced than even these : where any one is allowed to have his own peculiar way of thinking , his own peculiar creed , there neither is a watch , nor a right to watch over each other ; there is no mutual communication , no encouragement , no parental control ; and the consequence is , that by the majority , especially the young , religion becomes wholly and utterly disregarded .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 97]: Another great evil , arising from the peculiarity of the voluntary system is , that in any of the principal sects the power has been wrested from the clergy and assumed by the laity , who exercise an inquisition most injurious to the cause of religion : and to such an excess of tyranny is this power exercised , that it depends upon the _ laity _ , and not upon the _ clergy _ , whether any individual shall or shall not be admitted as a _ communicant _ at the table of our Lord .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 22]: Miss Martineau may well inquire , `` How does the existing state of religion accord with the promise of its birth ?
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 35]: In a country which professes to every man the pursuit of happiness in his own way , what is the state of his liberty in the most private and individual of all concerns ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 34]: Referring to religious instruction , Mr Carey in his work attempts to prove the great superiority of religious instruction and church accommodation in America , as compared with those matters in this country .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 18]: He draws his conclusions from the number of churches built and provided for the population in each .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 42]: Like most others of his conclusions , they are drawn from false premises : he might just as well argue upon the number of horses in each country , from the number of horse-ponds he might happen to count in each .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 91]: In the first place , the size of the churches must be considered , and their ability to accommodate the population ; and on this point , the question is greatly in favour of England ; for , with the exception of the cities and large towns , the churches scattered about the hamlets and large towns are small even to ridicule , built of clap-boards , and so light that , if on wheels , two pair of English post-horses would trot them away , to meet the minister .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 22]: Mr Carey also finds fault with the sites of our churches as being unfortunate in consequence of the change of population .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 68]: There is some truth in this remark : but our churches being built of brick and stone can not be so easily removed ; and it happens that the sites of the majority of the American churches are equally unfortunate , not as in our case , from the population having _ left _ them , but from the population not having _ come _ to them .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 71]: You may pass in one day a dozen towns having not above twenty or thirty private houses , although you will invariably find in each an hotel , a bank , and churches of two or three denominations , built as a speculation , either by those who hold the ground lots or by those who have settled there , and as an inducement to others to come and settle .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 40]: The churches , as Mr Carey states , exist , but the congregations have not arrived ; while you may , at other times , pass over many miles without finding a place of worship for the spare population .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 66]: I have no hesitation in asserting , not only that our 12,000 churches and cathedrals will hold a larger number of people than the 20,000 stated by Mr Carey to be erected in America , but that as many people , -LRB- taking into consideration the difference of the population , -RRB- go to our 12,000 , as to the 20,000 in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 27]: Neither is Mr Carey correct when he would insinuate that the attention given by the people in America to religious accommodation is greater than with us .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 75]: It is true , that more churches , such as they are , are built in America ; but paying an average of 12,000 pounds for a church built of brick or stone in England , is a very different thing from paying 12,000 dollars for a clap-board and shingle affair in America , and which , compared with those of brick and mortar , are there in the proportion of ten to one .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 43]: And further , the comparative value of church building in America is very much lowered by the circumstance that they are compelled to multiply them , to provide for the immense variety of creeds which exist under the _ voluntary _ system .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 43]: When people in a community are all of one creed , one church is sufficient ; but if they are of different persuasions , they must , as they do in America , divide the one large church into four little ones .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 16]: It is not fair , therefore , for Mr Carey to count _ churches _ .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 3]: -LSB- Note .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 42]: `` We know also that large sums are expended annually for the building of churches or places of worship , which in cities cost from 10,000 to 100,000 dollars each ; and in the country from 500 to 5,000 dollars . ''

Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 57]: But , although I will not admit the conclusions drawn from Mr Carey 's premises , nor that , as he would attempt to prove , the Americans are a more religious people than the English , I am not only ready , but anxious to do justice to the really religious portion of its inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 74]: I believe that in no other country is there more zeal shown by its various ministers , zeal even to the sacrifice of life ; that no country sends out more zealous missionaries ; that no country has more societies for the diffusion of the gospel and that in no other country in the world are larger sums subscribed for the furtherance of those praise-worthy objects as in the Eastern States of America .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 53]: I admit all this , and admit it with pleasure ; for I know it to be a fact : I only regret to add that in no other country are such strenuous exertions so incessantly required to stem the torrent of atheism and infidelity , which so universally exists in this .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 40]: Indeed this very zeal , so ardent on the part of the ministers , and so aided by the well-disposed of the laity , proves that what I have just now asserted is , unfortunately , but too true .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 23]: It is not my intention to comment upon the numerous sects , and the varieties of worship practised in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 47]: The Episcopal church is small in proportion to the others , and as far as I can ascertain , although it may increase its members with the increase of population , it is not likely to make any vigorous or successful stand against the other sects .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 17]: The two churches most congenial to the American feelings and institutions are the Presbyterian and Congregationalist .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 26]: `` The Congregationalists answer to the Independents of England and are sympathetically , and to a great extent , lineally descendants of the Puritans . ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 10]: -- _ Voice from America _ , p. 62 .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 92]: They may , indeed , in opposition to the hierarchy of the Episcopal , be considered as Republican churches ; and admitting that many errors have crept into the established church from its too intimate union with the State , I think it will be proved that , in rejecting its errors and the domination of the mitre , the seceders have fallen into still greater evils ; and have , for the latter , substituted a despotism to which every thing , even religion itself , must in America succumb .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 30]: In a republic , or democracy , the people will rule in every thing : in the Congregational church they rule as deacons ; in the Presbyterian as elders .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 43]: Affairs are litigated and decided in committees and councils , and thus is the pastoral office deprived of its primitive and legitimate influence , and the ministers are tyrannised over by the laity , in the most absurd and most unjustifiable manner .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 35]: If the minister does not submit to their decisions , if he asserts his right as a minister to preach the word according to his reading of it , he is arraigned and dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 26]: In short , although sent for to instruct the people , he must consent to be instructed by them , or surrender up his trust .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 40]: Thus do the ministers lose all their dignity and become the slaves of the congregation , who give them their choice , either to read the Scriptures according to _ their _ reading , or to go and starve .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 35]: I was once canvassing this question with an American , who pronounced that the laity were quite right , and that it was the duty of the minister to preach as his congregation wished .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 68]: His argument was this : -- `` If I send to Manchester for any article to be manufactured , I expect it to be made exactly after the pattern given ; if not , I will not take it : so it is with the minister : he must find goods exactly suited to his customers , or expect them to be left on his hands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 17]: And it really would appear as if such were the general opinion in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 56]: Mr Colton , an American minister , who turned from the Presbyterian to the Episcopal church , in his `` Reasons for Episcopacy , '' makes the following remarks : -- -LSB- I must request the reader 's forbearance at the extreme length of the quotations , but I can not well avoid making them .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 39]: Whatever weight my opinion , as the opinion of an observant traveller may have , it must naturally be much increased if supported , as it always is when opportunity offers , by _ American _ authority . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 55]: Speaking of the deacons and elders of their churches , he says -- `` They may be honest and good men , and very pious : but in most churches they are men of little intellectual culture ; and the less they have , the more confident and unbending are they in their opinions .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 42]: If a minister travels an inch beyond the circle of their vision in theology , or startles them with a new idea in his interpretation of Scripture , it is not unlikely that their suspicions of his orthodoxy will be awakened .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 16]: If he does any thing out of the common course , he is an innovator .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 38]: If , from the multiplicity of his cares and engagements , he is now and then obliged to preach an old sermon , or does not visit so much as might be expected , he is lazy .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 22]: For these and for other delinquencies , as adjudged by these associates , it becomes their conscientious duty to admonish him .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 13]: He who is appointed to supervise the flock , is himself supervised .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 70]: ` I have a charge to give you , ' said a deacon to me once , the first time and the moment I was introduced to him , after I had preached one or two Sabbaths in the place , and , as it happened , it was the first word he said after we shook hands , adding , ` I often give charges to ministers . '
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 73]: I knew him to be an important man , and the first in the church ; but as I had nothing at stake there that depended on his favour , I could not resist the temptation of replying to him in view of his consequential airs , ` You may use your discretion , sir , in this particular instance ; but I can tell you that ministers are sometimes overcharged . '
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 7]: However , I did not escape .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 79]: `` The American clergy are the most backward and timid class in the society in which they live ; self-exiled from the great moral question of the time ; the least informed with true knowledge -- the least efficient in virtuous action -- the least conscious of that Christian and republican freedom which , as the native atmosphere of piety and holiness , it is their prime duty to cherish and diffuse , '' -- _ Miss Martineau .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 11]: _ I quote this paragraph to _ contradict it _ .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 44]: The American clergy are , in the mass , equal , if not superior , to any in the world : they have to struggle with difficulties almost insurmountable , -LRB- as I shall substantiate -RRB- and worthily do they perform their tasks .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 42]: `` It seems to be a principle in Presbyterian and Congregational churches , that the minister must be overlooked by the elders and deacons ; and if he does not quietly submit to their rule , his condition will be uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 29]: He may also expect visitations from _ women _ to instruct him in his duty ; at least , they will contrive to convey to him their opinions .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 77]: It is said of Dr Bellamy , of Bethlehem , Connecticut , who was eminently a peace-maker , and was always sent for by all the churches in the country around , or a great distance , to settle their difficulties , that having just returned from one of these errands , and put up his horse , another message of the same kind came from another quarter -- ` And what is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 7]: said the Doctor to the messenger .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 40]: ` Why , ' said he , ` Deacon has -- ' ` Has -- that 's enough -- There never is a difficulty in a church , but some old deacon is at the bottom of it . '
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 37]: `` Unquestionably , it is proper , wise , and prudent , for every minister to watch and consult the popular opinion around him , in relation to himself , his preaching , and his conduct .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 29]: But , if a minister is worthy to be the pastor of a people , he is also worthy of some confidence , and ought to receive deference .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 38]: In his own proper work he may be helped , he may be sustained , but he can not be instructed by his people ; he can not in general be instructed by the wisest of them .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 21]: Respectful and kind hints from competent persons he may receive , and should court -- he may profit by them .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 34]: But , if he is a man fit for his place , he should retain that honour that will leave him scope , and inspire him with courage to act a manly part .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 35]: A Christian pastor can never fulfil his office , and attain its highest ends , without being free to act among his people according to the light of his conscience and his best discretion .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 23]: To have elders and deacons to rule over him , is to be a slave -- is not to be a man .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 27]: The responsibilities , cares , burdens , and labours of the pastoral office are enough , without being impeded and oppressed by such anxieties as these .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 76]: In the early history of New England , a non-conformist minister , from the old country , is represented to have said , after a little experience on this side of the water , ` I left England to get rid of my lords the bishops ; but here I find in their place my lords , the brethren and sisters ; save me from the latter , and let me have the former . '
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 148]: `` It has actually happened -- within a few years -- in New England , and I believe in other parts of the country , that there has been a system of lay visitation of the clergy for the purpose of counselling , admonishing , and urging them up to their duty ; and that these self-commissioned apostles , two and two , have gone from town to town , and from district to district of the country , making inquisition at the mouth of common rumour , and by such methods as might be convenient , into the conduct and fidelity of clergymen whom they never saw ; and , having exhausted their means of information , have made their way into the closets of their adopted proteges ; to advise , admonish , pray with , and for them ; according as they might need .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 50]: Having fulfilled their office , they have renewed their march , ` staff and script , ' in a straightforward way , to the next parish , in the assigned round of their visitations , to enact the same scene , and so on till their work was done .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 34]: `` Of course , they were variously received ; though , for the most part , I believe they have been treated civilly , and their title to this enterprise not openly disputed .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 55]: There has been an unaccountable submission to things of this kind , proving indeed that the ministers thus visited were not quite manly enough ; or that a public opinion , authorising these transactions , had obtained too extensive a sway in their own connexion , and among their people , to be resisted .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 21]: By many , doubtless , it was regarded as one of the hopeful symptoms of this age of religious experiment .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 20]: `` I have heard of one reception of these lay apostles , which may not be unworthy of record .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 57]: One pair of them -- for they went forth ` two and two , ' and thus far were conformed to scripture -- both of them mechanics , and one a shoemaker , having abandoned their calling to engage in this enterprise , came upon a subject who was not well disposed to recognise their commission .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 17]: They began to talk with him : ` We have come to stir you up . '
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 12]: -- ` How is the shoe business in your city ? '
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 22]: said the clergyman to the shoemaker , who was the speaker : for it was a city from which they came .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 50]: The shoemaker looked vacant , and stared at the question , as if he thought it not very pertinent to his errand ; and , after a little pause , proceeded in the discharge of his office : ` We have come to give your church a shaking . '
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 10]: -- ` Is the market for shoes good ? '
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 4]: said the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 19]: Abashed at this apparent obliquity , the shoemaker paused again ; and again went on in like manner .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 27]: To which the clergyman : ` Your business is at a stand , sir , I presume ; I suppose you have nothing to do . '
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 73]: And so the dialogue went on ; the shoemaker confining himself to his duty , and the clergyman talking only of shoes : in varied and constantly-shifting colloquy , till the perverse and wicked pertinacity of the latter discouraged the former ; and the shoemaker and his brother took up their hats , ` to shake off the dust of their feet , ' and turn away to a more hopeful subject .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 26]: The clergyman bowed them very civilly out of doors , expressing his wish , as they departed , that the shoe business might soon revive .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 31]: Of course , these lay apostles , in this instance , were horror-struck ; and it can not be supposed they were much inclined to leave their blessing behind them .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 88]: `` I believe I do not mistake in expressing the conviction that there are hundreds , not to say thousands , of the Presbyterian and Congregational clergy , who will sympathise with me thoroughly in these strictures on the encroachments of the laity upon pastoral prerogative ; who groan under it ; who feel that it ought to be rebuked and corrected , but despair of it ; and who know that their usefulness is abridged by it to an account that can not be estimated . ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 21]: -LSB- The Reverend Mr Reid mentions a very whimsical instance of the interference of the laity in every possible way .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 68]: He says , that being at church one Sabbath , there was one reverend old man , certainly a leader among them , who literally , as the preacher went on with his sermon , kept up a sort of recitation with him as , for instance , the preacher continuing his sermon -- The duty here inferred is , to deny ourselves -- _ Elder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 7]: And enable us to do it .

Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 19]: How necessary , then , that God should call upon us to renounce everything -- _ Elder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 4]: God help us !
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 4]: _ Preacher _ .

Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 32]: `` It can hardly be denied , I think , that the prevalence of this spirit has greatly increased within a few years , and become a great and alarming evil .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 64]: This increase is owing , no doubt , to the influence and new practices introduced into the religious world by a certain class of ministers , who have lately risen and taken upon themselves to rebuke , and set down as unfaithful , all other ministers who do not conform to their new ways , or sustain them in their extravagant career . ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 38]: The interference , I may say the tyranny , of the laity over the ministers of these democratic churches is , however , of still more serious consequences to those who accept such arduous and repulsive duty .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 40]: It is a well-known fact , that there is a species of _ bronchitis _ , or affection of the lungs , peculiar to the ministers in the United States , arising from their excessive labours in their vocation .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 60]: I have already observed , that the zeal of the minister is even unto death : the observations of Mr Colton fully bear me out in my assertion : -- `` There is another serious evil in the Presbyterian and Congregational denominations , which has attained to the consequence of an active and highly influential element in these communities .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 38]: I refer to the excessive amount of labour that is demanded of the clergy , which is undermining their health , and sending scores to their graves every year , long before they ought to go there .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 50]: It is a new state of things , it must be acknowledged , and might seem hopeful of good , that great labours and high devotion to the duties of the Christian ministry in our country will not only be tolerated , but are actually demanded and imperatively exacted .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 11]: At first glance , it is a most grateful feature .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 85]: But , when the particulars come to be inquired into , it will be found that the mind and health-destroying exactions now so extensively made on the energies of the American clergy , particularly on these two classes I am now considering , are attributable , almost entirely , to an appetite for certain novelties , which have been introduced within a few years , adding greatly to the amount of ministerial labour , without augmenting its efficiency , but rather detracting from it .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 36]: Sermons and meetings without end , and in almost endless variety , are expected and demanded ; and a proportionate demand is made on the intellect , resources , and physical energies of the preacher .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 30]: He must be as much more interesting in his exercises , and exhibitions as the increased multiplicity of public religious occasions tend to pall on the appetite of hearers .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 69]: Protracted meetings from day to day , and often from week to week , are making demands upon ministers , which no human power can sustain and , where these are dispensed with , it is often necessary to introduce something tantamount , in other forms , to satisfy the suggestions and wishes of persons so influential as to render it imprudent not to attempt to gratify them .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 39]: In the soberest congregations , throughout nearly all parts of the land , these importunate , and , without unkindness , I am disposed to add , morbid minds are to be found , often in considerable numbers .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 36]: Almost everywhere , in order to maintain their ground and satisfy the taste of the times , labours are demanded of ministers in these two denominations enough to kill any man in a short period .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 42]: It is as if Satan had come into the world in the form of an angel of light , seeming to be urging on a good work , but pushing it so hard as to destroy the labourers by over exaction .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 90]: `` The wasting energies -- the enfeebled , ruined health -- the frequent premature deaths -- the failing of ministers in the Presbyterian and Congregational connexions from these causes all over the country , almost as soon as they have begun to work -- all which is too manifest not to be seen , which everybody feels that takes any interest in this subject , are principally , and with few exceptions , owing to the unnecessary exorbitant demands on their intellectual powers , their moral and physical energies .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 65]: And the worst of it is , we not only have no indemnification for this amazing , immense sacrifice , by a real improvement of the state of religion , but the public mind is vitiated : an unnatural appetite for spurious excitements , all tending to fanaticism , and not a little of it the essence of fanaticism , is created and nourished .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 12]: The interests of religion in the land are actually thrown backward .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 22]: It is a fever , a disease which nothing but time , pains , and a change of system can cure .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 109]: A great body of the most talented , best educated , most zealous , most pious , and purest Christian ministers in the country -- not to disparage any others -- a body which in all respects will bear an advantageous comparison with any of their class in the world , is threatened to be enervated , to become sickly , to have their minds wasted , and their lives sacrificed out of season , and with real loss to the public , by the very means which prostrates them , even though we should leave out of the reckoning the premature end to which they are brought .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 27]: This spectacle , at this moment before the eyes of the wide community , is enough to fill the mind of an enlightened Christian with dismay .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 36]: I have myself been thrown ten years out of the stated use of the ministry by this very course , and may , therefore , be entitled to feel and to speak on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 49]: And when I see my brethren fallen and falling around me , like the slain in battle , the plains of our land literally covered with these unfortunate victims , I am constrained to express a most earnest desire , that some adequate remedy may be applied . ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 67]: It is no matter of surprise , then , that I heard the ministers at the camp meeting complain of the excess of their labours , and the difficulty of obtaining young men to enter the church ; -LSB- The Rev Mr Reid observes , speaking of the Congregationalists , `` When I rose to support his resolution , as requested , all were generously attentive .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 56]: At the close I alluded emphatically to one fact in the report , which was , That out of 4,500 churches there were 2,000 not only void of educated pastors , but void of pastors , and I insisted that , literally , they ought not to sleep on such a state of things . ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 29]: -- _ Reid and Matheson 's Tour _ -RSB- who , indeed , unless actuated by a holy zeal , would submit to such a life of degradation ?
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 45]: what man of intellect and education could submit to be schooled by shoemakers and mechanics , to live poor , and at the mercy of tyrants , and drop down dead like the jaded and over laden beast from excess of fatigue and exertion ?
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 51]: Let me again quote the same author : `` It is these excessive , multitudinous , and often long _ protracted _ religious occasions , together with the spirit that is in them , which have been for some years breaking up and breaking down the clergy of this land ?
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 9]: It has been breaking them _ up _ .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 29]: It is commonly observed , that a new era has lately come over the Christian congregations of our country in regard to the permanence of the pastoral relation .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 26]: Times was , in the memory of those now living , when the settlement of a minister was considered of course a settlement for life .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 48]: But now , as every body knows , this state of things is entirely broken up ; and it is , perhaps , true that , on an average , the clergy of this country do not remain more than five years in the same place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 29]: -LSB- `` I was sorry to find that , in this part of the State , the ministers are so frequently changing the scene of their pastoral labours .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 35]: The fault may sometimes be in themselves : but from conversations I have heard on the subject , I am inclined to believe that the _ people _ are fond of a change . ''
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 21]: -- _ Rev Mr Reid _ -RSB- And it is impossible they should , in the present state of things .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 6]: They could not stand it .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 188]: So numerous are their engagements ; so full of anxiety is their condition in a fevered state of the public mind acting upon them from all directions ; so consuming are their labours in the study and in public , pressed and urged upon them by the demands of the time ; and , withal , so fickle has the popular mind become under a system that is forever demanding some new and still more exciting measure -- some new society -- some new monthly or weekly meeting , which perhaps soon grows into a religious holiday -- some special effort running through many days , sometimes lasting for weeks , calling for public labours of ministers , of the most exciting kind throughout each day , from the earliest hour of the morning to a late hour of night ; for reasons and facts of this kind , so abundant , and now so obvious to the public , that they need only to be referred to , to be seen and appreciated , it is impossible that ministers should remain long in the same place .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 74]: Their mental and physical energies become exhausted , and they are compelled to change ; first , because it is not in the power of man to satisfy the appetite for novelties which is continually and from all quarters making its insatiate demands upon them ; and next ; that , if possible , they may purchase a breathing time and a transient relief from the overwhelming pressure of their cares and labours .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 5]: `` But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 20]: there is no relief : they are not only broken up , but they find themselves fast breaking down .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 18]: Wherever they go , there is the same demand for the same scene to be acted over .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 46]: There is -- there can be -- no stability in the pastoral relation , in such a state of the public mind : and , what is still more melancholy and affecting , the pastors themselves can not endure it -- they can not live .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 48]: They are not only constantly fluctuating -- literally afloat on the wide surface of the community -- but their health is undermined -- their spirits are sinking -- and they are fast treading upon each others ' heels to the grave , their only land of rest .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 61]: `` Never since the days of the apostles , was a country blessed with so enlightened , pious , orthodox , faithful , willing clergy , as the United States of America at this moment ; and never did a ministry , so worthy of trust , have so little independence to act according to their conscience and best discretion .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 37]: They are literally the victims of a spiritual tyranny that has started up and burst upon the world in a new form -- at least , with an extent of sway that has never been known .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 33]: It is an influence which comes up from the lowest conditions of life , which is vested in the most ignorant minds , and , therefore , the more unbending and uncontrollable .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 94]: It is an influence which has been fostered and blown into a wide-spread flame by a class of itinerating ministers , who have suddenly started up and overrun the land , decrying and denouncing all that have not yielded at once to their sway ; by direct and open efforts shaking and destroying public confidence in the settled and more permanent ministry , leaving old paths and striking out new ones , demolishing old systems and substituting others , and disturbing and deranging the whole order of society as it had existed before .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 62]: And it is to this new state of things , so harassing , so destructive to health and life , that the regular ministry of this country -LRB- the best qualified , most pious , most faithful , and in all respects the most worthy Christian ministry that the church has ever enjoyed in any age -RRB- are made the victims .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 13]: They can not resist it , they are overwhelmed by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 25]: The fact is , that there is little or no healthy religion in their most numerous and influential churches ; it is all excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 66]: Twenty or thirty years back , the Methodists were considered as extravagantly frantic , but the Congregationalists and Presbyterians in the United States have gone far ahead of them ; and the Methodist church in America has become to a degree Episcopal , and softened down into , perhaps , the most pure , most mild , and most simple of all the creeds professed .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 66]: I have said that in these two churches the religious feeling was that of excitement : I believe it to be more or less the case in _ all _ religion in America ; for the Americans are a people who are prone to excitement , not only from their climate , but constitutionally , and it is the _ caviare _ of their existence .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 55]: If it were not so , why is it necessary that revivals should be so continually called forth -- a species of stimulus , common , I believe , to almost every sect and creed , promoted and practised in all their colleges , and considered as most important and salutary in their results .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 146]: Let it not be supposed that I am deprecating that which is to be understood by a revival , in the true sense of the word ; not those revivals which were formerly held the benefit of all , and for the salvation of many : I am raising my voice against the modern system , which has been so universally substituted for the reality ; such as has been so fully exposed by Bishop Hopkins , of Vermont , and , by Mr Colton , who says -- `` Religious excitements , called revivals of religion , have been a prominent feature in the history of this country from its earliest periods , more particularly within a hundred years and the agency of man has always had more or less to do in their management , or in their origination , or in both .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 62]: Formerly , in theory , -LRB- for man is naturally a philosopher , and will always have his theory for every event , and every fact , -RRB- they were regarded as Pentecostal seasons -- as showers from heaven ; with which this world below had nothing to do but to receive , and be refreshed by them as they came .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 50]: A whole community , or the great majority of them , absorbed in serious thoughts about eternal things , inquiring the way to heaven , and seeming intent on the attainment of that high and glorious condition , presents a spectacle as solemn as it is interesting to contemplate .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 42]: Such , doubtless , has been the condition of many communities in the early and later history of American revivals ; and it is no less true that the fruits have been the turning of many to God and his ways .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 15]: `` The revivals of the present day are of a very different nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 60]: -LSB- The American clergymen are supported in their opinion on the present revivals and their consequences by Doctors Reid and Matheson , who , otherwise favourable to them , observe , `` These revival preachers have denounced pastors with whom they could not compare , as dumb dogs , hypocrites , and formalists , leading their people to hell .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 7]: The consequences have been most disastrous .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 13]: Churches have become the sport of derision , distraction , and disorder .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 10]: Pastors have been made unhappy in their dearest connexions .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 47]: So extensive has been this evil , that , in one presbytery of nineteen churches , there were only three who had settled pastors ; and in one synod , in 1832 , of a hundred and three churches , only fifty-two had pastors . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 48]: `` There are but two ways by which the mind of man can be brought to a proper sense of religion -- one is by love , and the other by fear ; and it is by the latter only that modern revivals become at all effective .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 29]: Bishop Hopkins says , very truly -- ` Have we any example in the preaching of Christ and his apostles , of the use of strong individual denunciation ?
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 41]: Is there one sentence in the word of inspiration to justify the attempt to excite the feelings of a public assembly , until every restraint of order is forgotten , and confusion becomes identified with the word of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 17]: -LSB- `` The Primitive Church Compared , '' etcetera , by the Bishop of Vermont . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 15]: Yet such are the revivals of the present day , as practised in America .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 45]: Mr Colton calls them -- `` Those startling and astounding shocks which are constantly invented , artfully and habitually applied , under all the power of sympathy , and of a studied and enthusiastic elocution , by a large class of preachers among us .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 14]: To startle and to shock is their great secret -- their power . ''
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 17]: The same author then proceeds : `` Religion is a dread and awful theme in itself .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 17]: That is , as all must concede , there are revealed truths belonging to the category .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 124]: To invest these truths with terrors that do not belong to them , by bringing them out in distorted shapes and unnatural forms ; to surprise a tender and unfortified mind by one of awful import , without exhibiting the corresponding relief which Christianity has provided ; to frighten , shock , and paralyse the mind with alternations and scenes of horror , carefully concealing the ground of encouragement and hope , till reason is shaken and hurled from its throne , for the sake of gaining a convert , and in making a convert to make a maniac -LRB- as doubtless sometimes occurs under this mode of preaching , for we have the proof of it , -RRB- involves a fearful responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 75]: I have just heard of an interesting girl thus driven to distraction , in the city of New York , at the tender age of fourteen , by being approached by the preacher after a sermon of this kind , with a secretary by his side with a book and pen in his hand , to take down the names and answers of those who , by invitation , remained to be conversed with .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 19]: Having taken her name , the preacher asked , ` Are you for God or the devil ? '
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 16]: Being overcome , her head depressed , and in tears , she made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 21]: ` Put her down , then , in the devil 's book , ' said the preacher to his secretary .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 29]: From that time the poor girl became insane ; and , in her simplicity and innocence , has been accustomed to tell the story of her misfortunes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 17]: And yet these revivals are looked up to and supported as the strong arm of religion .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 53]: It is not only the ignorant or the foolish , but the enlightened and the educated also , who support and encourage them , either from a consideration of their utility , or from that fear , so universal in the United States , of expressing an opinion contrary to the majority .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 32]: How otherwise could they be introduced once or twice a year into all the colleges , the professors of which are surely most of them men of education and strong mind ?
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 6]: Yet such is the fact .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 22]: It is announced that some minister , peculiarly gifted to work in revivals , is to come on a certain day .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 28]: Books are thrown on one side , study is abandoned , and ten days perhaps are spent in religious exercises of the most violent and exciting character .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 19]: It is a scene of strange confusion , some praying , some pretending to pray , some scoffing .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 31]: Day after day it is carried on , until the excitement is at its height , as the exhortations and the denunciations of the preacher are poured into their ears .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 77]: A young American who was at one of the colleges , and gave me a full detail of what had occurred , told me that on one occasion a poor lad , frightened out of his senses , and anxious to pray , as the vengeance and wrath of the Almighty was poured out by the minister , sunk down upon his knees and commenced his prayer with `` Almighty and _ diabolical _ God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 16]: No misnomer , if what the preacher had thundered out was the _ truth _ .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 87]: As an example of the interference of the laity , and of the description of people who may be so authorised , the same gentleman told me that at one revival a deacon said to him previous to the meeting , `` Now , Mr -- , if you do n't take advantage of this here revival and lay up a little salvation for your soul , all I can say is , that you ought to have your -LRB- something -RRB- confoundedly well kicked . ''
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 105]: What I have already said on this subject will , I think , establish two points , first , that the voluntary system does not work well for society ; and secondly , that the ministers of the churches are treated with such tyranny and contumely , as to warrant the assertion , that in a country , like the United States , where a man may , in any other profession , become independent in a few years , the number of those who enter into the ministry must decrease at the very time that the population and demand for them will increase .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 42]: We have now another question to be examined , and a very important one , which is : -- Are those who worship under the voluntary system supplied at a cheaper rate than those of the established churches in this kingdom ?
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 46]: I say this is an important question , as there is no doubt that one of the principal causes of dissenting has been the taxes upon religion in this country , and the wish , if it were attainable , of worshipping at free cost .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 157]: In entering into this question , there is no occasion to refer to any particular sect , as the system is much the same with them all , and is nearly as follows : Some pious and well disposed people of a certain persuasion , we will say , imagine that another church might , if it were built , be well filled with those of their own sect : and that , if it is not built , the consequences will be that many of their own persuasion will , from the habit of attending other churches , depart from those tenets which they are anxious should not only be retained by those who have embraced them , but as much as possible promulgated , so as to gather strength and make converts -- for it should be borne in mind that the sectarian spirit is one great cause of the rapid church-building in America .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 16]: -LSB- Churches are also built upon speculation , as they sometimes are in England . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 9]: One is of Paul , another of Apollos .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 65]: They meet , and become the future deacons and elders , in all probability , to whom the minister has to bow ; they agree to build a church at their own risque : they are not speculators , but religious people , who have not the least wish to make money , but who are prepared , if necessary , to lose it .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 36]: Say then that a handsome church -LRB- I am referring to the cities -RRB- of brick or stone , is raised in a certain quarter of the city , and that it costs 75,000 dollars .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 38]: When the interior is complete , and the pews are all built , they divide the whole cost of the church upon the pews , more or less value being put upon them according to their situations .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 50]: Allowing that there are two hundred pews , the one hundred most eligible being valued at five hundred dollars each ; and the other one hundred inferior at two hundred and fifty dollars ; these prices would pay the 75,000 dollars , the whole expense of the church building .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 30]: The pews are then put up to auction ; some of the most eligible will fetch higher prices than the valuation , while some are sold below the valuation .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 31]: If all are not sold , the residue remains upon the hands of the parties who built the church , and who may for a time be out of pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 30]: They have , however , to aid them , the extra price paid for the best pews , and the sale of the vaults for burial in the church-yard .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 14]: Most of the pews being sold , the church is partly paid for .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 19]: The next point is to select a minister , and , after due trial , one is chosen .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 95]: If he be a man of eloquence and talent , and his doctrines acceptable to the many , the church fills , the remainder of the pews are sold , and so far the expenses of building the church are defrayed ; but they have still to pay the salary of the minister , the heating and lighting of the church , the organist , and the vocalists : this is done by an assessment upon the pews , each pew being assessed according to the sum which it fetched when sold by auction .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 25]: I will now give the exact expenses of an American gentleman in Boston , who has his pew in one of the largest churches .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 23]: He purchased his pew at auction for seven hundred and fifty dollars , it being one of the best in the church .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 18]: The salaries of the most popular ministers vary from fifteen hundred to three or four thousand dollars .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 17]: The organist receives about five hundred ; the vocalists from two to three hundred dollars each .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 22]: To meet his share of these and the other expenses , the assessment of this gentleman is sixty-three dollars per annum .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 45]: Now , the interest of seven hundred and fifty dollars in America is forty-five dollars , and the assessment being sixty-three -- one hundred and eight dollars per annum , or twenty-two pounds ten shillings sterling for his yearly expenses under the voluntary system .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 48]: This , of course , does not include the offerings of the plate , charity sermons , etcetera , all of which are to be added , and which will swell the sum , according to my friend 's statement , to about thirty pounds per annum .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 17]: -LSB- `` A great evil of our American churches is , their great respectability or exclusiveness .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 31]: Here , being of a large size and paid by Government , the church is open to all the citizens , with an equal right and equal chance of accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 20]: In ours , the dearness of pew-rent , especially in Episcopal and Presbyterian , turns poverty out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 33]: Poor people have a sense of shame , and I know many a one , who , because he can not go to Heaven decently , will not go at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 12]: -- _ Sketches of Paris by an American Gentleman _ . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 79]: It does not appear by the above calculations that the voluntary system has cheapness to recommend it , when people worship in a respectable manner , as you might hire a house and farm of fifty acres in that State for the same rent which this gentleman pays for going to church ; but it must also be recollected that it is quite optional and that those who do not go to church need not pay at all .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 15]: It was not , however , until late years that such was the case .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 44]: In Massachusetts , and in most of the Eastern States , the system was not voluntary , and it is to this cause that may be ascribed the superior morality and reverence for religion still existing , although decaying , in these States .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 21]: By former enactments in Massachusetts , landowners in the country were compelled to contribute to the support of the church .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 37]: Pews in cities or towns are mentioned in all deeds and wills as _ personal _ property ; but in the country , before the late Act , they were considered as _ real _ estate .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 54]: A pew was allotted each farm , and whether the proprietor occupied it or not , he was obliged to pay for it ; but by an Act of the Massachusetts State legislature , passed within these few years , it was decided that no man should be compelled to pay for religion .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 35]: The consequence has been , that the farmers now refuse to pay for their pews , the churches are empty , and a portion of the clergy have been reduced to the greatest distress .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 31]: An itinerant ranter , who will preach in the open air , and send his hat round for cents , suits the farmers much better as it is much cheaper .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 21]: Certainly this does not argue much for the progressive advancement of religion , even in the moral State of Massachusetts .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 19]: In other points the cause of morality has , till lately , been upheld in these Eastern States .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 23]: It was but the other day that a man was discharged from prison , who had been confined for disseminating atheistical doctrines .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 43]: It was , however , said at the time , that that was the last attempt that would ever be made by the authorities to imprison a man for liberty of conscience ; and I believe that such will be the case .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 41]: The _ Boston Advocate _ says -- `` Abner Kneeland came out of prison yesterday , where he has been for sixty days , under the barbarous and bigoted law of Massachusetts , which imprisons men for freedom of opinions .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 17]: As was to have been expected , Kneeland 's liberation was made a sort of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 24]: About three hundred persons assembled , and were addressed by him at the jail , and he was conveyed home in a barouche .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 16]: During his persecution in prison , liberal sums of money have been sent to him .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 16]: How much has Christianity gained by this foul blot on the escutcheon of Massachusetts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 90]: It is however worthy of remark , that those States that have _ enforced _ religion and morality , and have punished infidelity , -LSB- Miss Martineau complains of this as contrary to the unalienable rights of man : -- `` Instead of this we find laws framed against speculative atheists ; opprobrium directed against such as embrace natural religion otherwise than through Christianity , and a yet more bitter oppression exercised by those who view Christianity in one way over those who regard it in another . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 51]: are now the most virtuous , the most refined , and the most intellectual , and are quoted as such by American authors , like Mr Carey , who by the help of Massachusetts alone can bring out his statistics to anything near the mark requisite to support his theories .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 26]: It is my opinion that the voluntary system will never work well under any form of government , and still less so under a democracy .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 21]: Those who live under a democracy have but one pursuit , but one object to gain , which is wealth .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 8]: No one can serve God and Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 55]: To suppose that a man who has been in such ardent pursuit of wealth , as is the American for six days in the week , can recall his attention and thoughts to serious points on the seventh , is absurd ; you might as well expect him to forget his tobacco on Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 33]: Under a democracy , therefore , you must look for religion among the women , not among the men , and such is found to be the case in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 35]: As Sam Slick very truly says , `` It 's only women who attend meeting : the men folks have their politics and trade to talk over and hav n't _ time _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 23]: Even an established church would not make people as religious under a democratic form of government as it would under any other .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 30]: -LSB- Mrs Trollope observes , `` A stranger taking up his residence in any city in America , must think the natives the most religious people upon earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 31]: This is very true ; the _ outward _ observances are very strict ; why so will be better comprehended when the reader has finished my remarks upon the country .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 45]: The author of Mammon very truly observes , that the only vice which we can practise without being arraigned for it in this world , and at the same time go through the _ forms _ of religion , is _ covetousness _ . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 15]: I have yet to point out how slander and defamation flourish under a democracy .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 44]: Now , this voluntary system , from the interference of the laity , who judge not only the minister , but the congregation , gives what appears to be a legitimate sanction to this tyrannical surveillance over the conduct and behaviour of others .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 57]: I really believe that the majority of men who go to church in America do so , not from zeal towards God , but from fear of their neighbours ; and this very tyranny in the more established persuasions , is the cause of thousands turning away to other sects which are not subjected to scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 17]: The Unitarian is in this point the most convenient , and is therefore fast gaining ground .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 64]: Mr Colton observes , `` Nothing can be more clear , than that scripture authority against meddling , tattling , slander , scandal , or in any way interfering with the private concerns , conduct , and character of our neighbours , except as civil or ecclesiastical authority has clothed us with legitimate powers , is specific , abundant , decided , emphatic .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 26]: It is founded in human nature ; it is essential to the peace of society a departure from it would be ruinous to social comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 39]: If therefore it is proper to introduce any rule on this point into a mutual church covenant , it seems to me that the converse of that which is usually found in that place ought to be substituted .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 36]: Even the apostles , as we have seen , found it necessary to rebuke the disposition prevalent in their time to meddle with the affairs , and to make inquisition into the conduct of others .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 27]: But it should be recollected , that the condition of Christians and the state of society then were widely different from the same things with us .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 13]: Christianity was a new religion , and its disciples were generally obnoxious .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 35]: They were compelled by their circumstances to associate most intimately ; they were bound together by those sympathies and ties , which a persecuted and suffering class always feel , independent of Christian affection .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 13]: Hence in part we account for the holy and exemplary candour -LSB- ?
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 14]: an dour -RSB- of their attachments to their religion and to each other .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 66]: But even in these circumstances , and under these especial intimacies , or rather , perhaps , on account of them , the apostles found it necessary to admonish them against the abuse of that confidence so generally felt and reciprocated by those who confessed Christ in those unhappy times ; an abuse so naturally developed in the form of meddling and private inquisition . ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 50]: I quote the above passage , as , in the United States , the variety of sects , the continual splitting and breaking up of those sects , and their occasional violent altercations , have all proved most injurious to society , and to the cause of religion itself .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 34]: Indeed religion in the States may be said to have been a source of continual discord and the unhinging of society , instead of that peace and good-will inculcated by our divine Legislator .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 41]: It is the division of the Protestant church which has occasioned its weakness in this country , and will probably eventually occasion , if not its total subversion , at all events its subversion in the western hemisphere of America .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 29]: The subjugation of the ministry to the tyranny of their congregations is another most serious evil ; for either they must surrender up their consciences or their bread .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 51]: In too many instances it is the same here in religion as in politics : before the people will permit any one to serve them in any office , he must first prove his unfitness , by submitting to what no man of honesty or conscientious rectitude would subscribe to .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 23]: This must of course , in both cases , be taken with exceptions , but it is but too often the fact .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 84]: And hence has arisen another evil , which is , that there are hundreds of self-constituted ministers , who wander over the western country , using the word of God as a cloak , working upon the feelings of the women to obtain money , and rendering religion a by-word among the men , who will , in all probability , some day rise up and lynch some dozen of them , as a hint for the rest to _ clear out _ .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 21]: It would appear as if Locofoco-ism and infidelity had formed an union , and were fighting under the same banner .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 19]: They have recently celebrated the birth-day of Tom Paine , in Cincinnati , New York , and Boston .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 42]: In Cincinnati , Frances Wright Darusmont , better known as Fanny Wright , was present , and made a violent politico-atheistical speech on the occasion , in which she denounced banking , and almost every other established institution of the country .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 54]: The nature of the celebration in Boston will be understood from the following toast , given on the occasion : By George Chapman : -- '' _ Christianity _ and the _ banks _ , tottering on their last legs : May their _ downfall _ be speedy , '' etcetera , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 71]: Miss Martineau informs us that `` The churches of Boston , and even the other public buildings , being guarded by the dragon of bigotry , so that even Faith , Hope , and Charity , are turned back from the doors , a large building is about to be erected for the use of all , Deists not excepted , who may desire to meet for free discussion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 14]: She adds , '' _ This at least is in advance _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 29]: And in a few pages further : -- `` The eagerness in pursuit of speculative truth is shown by the _ rapid sale of every heretical work _ .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 48]: The clergy complain of the enormous spread of bold books , from the infidel tract to the latest handling of the miracle question , as sorrowfully as the most liberal members of society lament the unlimited circulation of the false morals issued by certain Religious Tract Societies .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 12]: Both testify to the interest taken by the public in religion .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 17]: The love of truth is also shown by the outbreak of heresy in all directions ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 27]: Having stated the most obvious objections to the voluntary system , I shall now proceed to show how far my opinions are corroborated by American authorities .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 114]: The author of `` A Voice from America , '' observes very truly , that the voluntary system of supporting religion in America is inadequate to the purpose , and he closes his argument with the following observation : -- `` How far that part of the system of supporting religion in America , which appeals to the pride and public spirit of the citizens , in erecting and maintaining religious institutions on a respectable footing , in towns , cities , and villages , and among rival sects -- and in this manner operating as a species of constraint -- is worthy to be called voluntary , we pretend not to say .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 17]: But this comprehends by far the greatest sum that is raised and appropriated to these objects .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 10]: All the rest is a mere fraction in comparison .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 39]: And yet it is allowed , and made a topic of grievous lamentation , that the religious wants of the country are most inadequately supplied ; and such , indeed , we believe to be the fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 37]: The next point referred to by this author is , `` that the American system of supporting religion has brought about great instability in the religious world , and induced a ruinous habit of change . ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 40]: This arises from the caprice of the congregation , for Americans are naturally capricious and fond of change : whether it be concerning a singer , or an actor , or a clergyman , it is the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 39]: This American author observes , `` There are few clergymen that can support their early popularity for a considerable time ; and as soon as it declines , they must begin to think of providing elsewhere for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 28]: They go -- migrate -- and for the same reason , in an equal term of time , they are liable to be forced to migrate again .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 19]: And thus there is no stability , but everlasting change , in the condition of the American clergy .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 26]: _ They _ change , the _ people _ change -- all is a round of change -- because all depends on the voluntary principle .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 35]: The clerical profession in America is , indeed , like that of a soldier ; always under arms , frequently fighting , and always ready for a new campaign -- a truly militant state .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 37]: A _ Clergyman 's Guide _ would be of little use , so far as the object might be to direct where to find him : he is not this year where he was last . ''
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 27]: And , as must be the consequence , he justly observes , `` Such a system makes the clergy servile , and the people tyrannical . ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 49]: `` When the enmity of a single individual is sufficient to destroy a resident pastor 's peace , and to break him up , how can he be otherwise than servile , if he has a family about him , to whom perpetual change is inconvenient and disastrous ?
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 54]: There is not a man in his flock , however mean and unworthy of influence , whom he does not fear ; and if he happens to displease a man of importance , or a busy woman , there is an end to his peace ; and he may begin to pack up .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 33]: This perpetual bondage breaks down his mind , subdues his courage , and makes a timid nervous woman of one who is entitled , and who ought to be , a man .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 13]: He drags out a miserable existence , and dies a miserable slave .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 38]: There are exceptions to this rule , it is true ; because there are clergymen with talent enough to rise above these disadvantages , enforce respect , and maintain their standing , in spite of enemies . ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 46]: But there is another very strong objection , and most important one , to the voluntary system , which I have delayed to bring forward : which is , that there is _ no provision for the poor _ in the American voluntary church system .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 15]: Thus only those who are rich and able to afford religion can obtain it .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 64]: At present , it is true that the majority of the people in America have means sufficient to pay for seats in churches , if they choose to expend the money ; but as America increases her population , so will she increase the number of her poor ; and what will be the consequence hereafter , if this evil is to continue ?
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 37]: The author I am now quoting from observes , `` At best the _ poor are unprovided for _ , and the talents of the clergy are always in the market to the highest bidder . ''
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 5]: -LSB- This is true .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 69]: When I was in the States one of the most popular preachers quitted his church at Boston to go to New York , where he was offered an increase of salary ; telling his parishioners `` that he found _ he would be more useful elsewhere _ '' -- the very language used by the Laity to the clergyman when _ they _ dismiss _ him _ . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 45]: There have been many attempts to remedy this evil , in the dense population of cities , by setting up a still more voluntary system , called ` free churches , ' in which the pews are not rented , but free to all .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 8]: But they are uniformly _ failures _ .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 64]: Two other remarks made by this author are equally correct ; first , that the voluntary system tends to the multiplication of sects without end ; and next , that the voluntary system is a mendicant system , and involves one of the worst features of the church of Rome , which is , that it tends to the production of pious frauds .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 28]: But I have already , in support of my arguments , quoted so much from this book that I must refer the reader to the work itself .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 52]: At present , Massachusetts , and the smaller Eastern States , are the strong-hold of religion and morality ; as you proceed from them farther south or west , so does the influence of the clergy decrease , until it is totally lost in the wild States of Missouri and Arkansas .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 58]: With the exception of certain cases to be found in Western Virginia , Kentucky , and Ohio , the whole of the States to the westward of the Alleghany Mountains , comprising more than two-thirds of America , may be said to be either in a state of neglect and darkness , or professing the Catholic religion .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 87]: Although Virginia is a slave state , I think there is more religion there than in some of the more northern free states ; but it must be recollected that Virginia has been long settled , and the non - _ predial _ state of the slaves is not attended with demoralising effects ; and I may here observe that the _ black _ population of American is decidedly the most religious , and sets an example to the white , particularly in the free states .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 49]: -LSB- Mr Reid , in his Tour , describes a visit which he paid to a black church in Kentucky : -- `` By the laws of the state , no coloured persons are permitted to assemble for worship , unless a white person be present and preside .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 26]: `` One of the black preachers , addressing me as their ` strange master , ' begged that I would take charge of the service .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 5]: I declined doing so .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 17]: He gave out Dr Watts ' beautiful psalm , ` Shew pity , Lord , oh !
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 4]: Lord forgive . '
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 5]: They all rose immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 29]: They had no books , for they could not read ; but it was printed on their memory , and they sung it off with freedom and feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 25]: `` The senior black , who was a preacher among them , then offered prayer and preached ; his prayer was humble and devotional .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 13]: In one portion , he made an affecting allusion to their wrongs .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 37]: ` Thou knowest , ' said the good man , with a broken voice , ` our state -- that it is the meanest -- that we are as mean and low as man can be .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 32]: But we have sinned -- we have forfeited all our rights to THEE , and we would submit before _ Thee _ , to these marks of thy displeasure . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 61]: Mr Reid subsequently asserts , that the sermon delivered by the black was an `` earnest and efficient appeal ; '' and , afterward , hearing a sermon on the same day from a white preacher , he observes that it was a '' _ very sorry affair _ , '' in contrast with what he had before witnessed . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 11]: It may be fairly inquired , can this be true ?
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 27]: Not fifty years back , at the time of the Declaration of Independence , was not the American community one of the most virtuous in existence ?
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 21]: Such was indeed the case , as it is now equally certain that they are one of the most demoralised .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 21]: The question is , then , what can have created such a change in the short period of fifty years ?
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 62]: The only reply that can be given , is , that as the Americans , in their eagerness to possess new lands , pushed away into the West , so did they leave civilisation behind , and return to ignorance and barbarism ; they scattered their population , and the word of God was not to be heard in the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 31]: That as she increased her slave states , so did she give employment , land , and power to those who were indifferent to all law , human or divine .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 43]: And as , since the formation of the Union , the people have yearly gained advantages over the _ government _ until they now control it , so have they controlled and fettered _ religion _ until it produces no good fruits .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 33]: Add to this the demoralising effects of a democracy which turns the thoughts of all to Mammon , and it will be acknowledged that this rapid fall is not so very surprising .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 42]: But , if the Protestant cause is growing weaker every day from disunions and indifference , there is one creed which is as rapidly gaining strength ; I refer to the Catholic church , which is silently , but surely advancing .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 46]: -LSB- Although it is not forty years since the first Roman Catholic see was created , there is now in the United States a Catholic population of 800,000 souls under the government of the Pope , or Archbishop , 12 Bishops , and 433 priests .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 79]: The number of churches is 401 ; mass houses , about 300 ; colleges , 10 ; seminaries for young men , 9 ; theological seminaries , 5 ; noviciates for Jesuits , monasteries , and converts , with academies attached , 31 ; seminaries for young ladies , 30 ; schools of the Sisters of Charity , 29 ; an academy for coloured girls at Baltimore ; a female infant school , and 7 Catholic newspapers . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 30]: Its great field is in the West , where , in some states , almost all are Catholics , or from neglect and ignorance altogether indifferent as to religion .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 46]: The Catholic priests are diligent , and make a large number of converts every year , and the Catholic population is added to by the number of Irish and German emigrants to the West , who are almost all of them of the Catholic persuasion .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 23]: Mr Tocqueville says -- `` I think that the Catholic religion has erroneously been looked upon as the natural enemy of democracy .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 29]: Among the various sects of Christians , Catholicism seems to me , on the contrary to be one of those which are most favourable to equality of conditions .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 21]: In the Catholic church , the religious community is composed of only two elements -- the priest and the people .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 18]: The priest alone rises above the rank of his flock , and all below him are equal .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 16]: On doctrinal points , the Catholic faith places all human capacities upon the same level .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 96]: It subjects the wise and the ignorant , the man of genius and the vulgar crowd , to the details of the same creed : it imposes the same observances upon the rich and the needy ; it inflicts the same austerities upon the strong and the weak ; it listens to no compromise with mortal man ; but , reducing all the human race to the same standard , it confounds all the distinctions of society at the foot of the same altar , even as they are confounded in the sight of God .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 42]: If Catholicism predisposes the faithful to obedience , it certainly does not prepare them for inequality ; but the contrary may be said of Protestantism , which generally tends to make men independent , more than to render them equal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 24]: And the author of a Voice from America observes -- `` The Roman Catholic church bids fair to rise to importance in America .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 80]: Thoroughly democratic as her members are , being composed for the most part , of the lowest orders of European population , transplanted to the United States with a fixed and implacable aversion to everything bearing the name and in the shape of monarchy , the priesthood are accustomed _ studiously to adapt themselves to this state of feeling _ , being content with that authority that is awarded to their office by their own communicants and members . ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 27]: -LSB- The Rev Dr Reid observes : -- `` I found the people at this time under some uneasiness in relation to the spread of Romanism .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 17]: The partisans of that system are greatly assisted from Europe by supplies of money and teachers .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 37]: The teachers have usually more acquired competency than the native instructors ; and this is a temptation to parents who are seeking accomplishments for their children , and who have a high idea of European refinements .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 30]: It appeared , that out of four schools , provided for the wants of the town -LRB- Lexington , Kentucky -RRB- three were in the hands of Catholics . ''
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 39]: To which we may add Miss Martineau 's observations : -- `` The Catholics of the country , thinking themselves now sufficiently numerous to be an American Catholic church , a great stimulus has been given to proselytism .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 20]: This has awakened fear and persecution ; which last has again been favourable to the increase of the sect .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 33]: While the Presbyterians preach a harsh , ascetic , persecuting religion , the Catholics dispense a mild and indulgent one ; and the prodigious increase of their numbers is a necessary consequence .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 26]: It has been so impossible to supply the demand for priests , that the term of education has been shortened by two years . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 85]: Now , I venture to disagree with both these gentlemen : It is true , as Mr Tocqueville observes , that the Catholic church reduces all the human race to the same standard , and confounds all distinctions -- not , however , upon the principle of equality or democracy , but because it will ever equally exert its power over the high and the low , assuming its right to compel princes and kings to obedience , and their dominions to its subjection .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 70]: The equality professed by the Catholic church , is like the equality of death , all must fall before its power ; whether it be to excommunicate an individual or an empire is to it indifferent ; it assumes the power of the Godhead , giving and taking sway , and its members stand trembling before it , as they shall hereafter do in the presence of the Deity .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 73]: The remark of the author of the _ Voice from America _ , `` that aware of the implacable aversion of the people to monarchy , the priesthood are accustomed _ studiously to adapt themselves to this state of feeling _ , '' proves rather to me the universal subtlety shown by the Catholic clergy , which , added to their zeal and perseverance , so increases the power of the church .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 67]: At present Catholicism is , comparatively speaking , weak in America , and the objects of that church is , to become strong ; they do not , therefore , frighten or alarm their converts by any present show of the invariable results ; but are content to bide their time , until they shall find themselves strong enough to exert their power with triumphant success .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 26]: The Protestant cause in America is weak , from the evil effects of the voluntary system , particularly from its division into so many sects .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 88]: A house divided against itself can not long stand ; and every year it will be found that the Catholic church will increase its power : and it is a question whether a hierarchy may not eventually be raised , which , so far from _ advocating the principles of equality _ , may serve as a _ check _ to the spirit of democracy becoming more powerful than the government , curbing public opinion , and reducing to better order the present chaotic state of society .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 13]: Judge Haliburten asserts , that all America will be a Catholic country .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 90]: That all America west of the Alleghanies will eventually be a Catholic country , I have no doubt , as the Catholics are already in the majority , and there is nothing , as Mr Cooper observes , to prevent any state from establishing that , or any other religion , as the _ Religion of the State _ ; -LSB- `` There is nothing in the constitution of the United States to prevent all the states , or any particular state , from possessing an established religion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 25]: -- _ Cooper 's Democrat _ -RSB- and this is one of the dark clouds which hang over the destiny of the western hemisphere .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 35]: The reverend Mr Reed says : -- `` It should really seem that the Pope , in the fear of expulsion from Europe , is anxious to find a reversion in this new world .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 34]: The crowned heads of the continent , having the same enmity to free political institutions which his holiness has to free religious institutions , willingly unite in the attempt to enthral this people .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 45]: They have heard of the necessities of the West ; they have the foresight to see that the West will become the heart of the country , and ultimately determine the character of the whole ; and they have resolved to establish themselves there .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 41]: Large , yea _ princely , grants _ have been made from the Leopold society , and other sources , chiefly , though by no means exclusively , in favour of this portion of the empire that is to be .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 18]: These sums are expended in erecting showy churches and colleges , and in sustaining priests and emissaries .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 17]: Everything is done to captivate , and to liberalise in appearance , a system essentially despotic .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 30]: The sagacity of the effort is discovered , in avoiding to attack and shock the prejudices of the adult , that they may direct the education of the young .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 16]: They look to the future ; and they really have great advantages in doing so .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 18]: They send out teachers excellently qualified ; superior , certainly , to the run of native teachers .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 20]: -LSB- The Catholic priests who instruct are , to my knowledge , the best educated men in the states .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 11]: It was a pleasure to be in their company . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 48]: Some value the European modes of education as the more excellent , others value them as the mark of fashion ; the demand for instruction , too , is always beyond the supply , so that they find little difficulty in obtaining the charge of protestant children .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 46]: This , in my judgment , is the point of policy which should be especially regarded with jealousy ; but the actual alarm has arisen from the disclosure of a correspondence which avows designs on the West , beyond what I have here set down .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 25]: It is a curious affair , and is one other evidence , if evidence were needed , that popery and jesuitism are one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 27]: I think that the author of Sam Slick may not be wrong in his assertion , that _ all _ America will be a Catholic country .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 61]: I myself never prophesy ; but , I can not help remarking , that even in the most anti-Catholic persuasions in America there is a strong Papistical _ feeling _ ; that is , there is a vying with each other , not only to obtain the best preachers , but to have the best organs and the best singers .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 21]: It is the system of excitement which , without their being aware of it , they carry into their devotion .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 35]: It proves that , to them there is a weariness in the church service , a tedium in prayer , which requires to be relieved by the stimulus of good music and sweet voices .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 64]: Indeed , what with their _ anxious seats _ , their _ revivals _ , their _ music _ and their _ singing _ , every class and sect in the states have even now so far fallen into Catholicism , that religion has become more of an appeal to the _ senses _ than to the calm and _ sober judgment _ .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 7]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER FORTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 6]: REMARKS -- SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 52]: Although in a democracy the highest stations and preferments are open to all , more directly than they may be under any other form of government , still these prizes are but few and insufficient , compared with the number of total blanks which must be drawn by the ambitious multitude .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 69]: It is , indeed , a stimulus to ambition -LRB- and a matter of justice , when all men are pronounced equal -RRB- , that they all should have an equal chance of raising themselves by their talents and perseverance ; but , when so many competitors are permitted to enter the field , few can arrive at the goal , and the mass are doomed to disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 47]: However fair , therefore , it may be to admit all to the competition , certain it is that the competition can not add to the happiness of a people , when we consider the feelings of bitterness and ill-will naturally engendered among the disappointed multitude .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 60]: In monarchical and aristocratical institutions , the middling and lower classes , whose chances of advancement are so small that they seldom lift their eyes or thoughts above their own sphere , are therefore much happier , and it may be added , much more virtuous than those who struggle continually for preferment in the tumultuous sea of democracy .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 56]: Wealth can give some importance , but wealth in a democracy gives an importance which is so common to many that it loses much of its value ; and when it has been acquired , it is not sufficient for the restless ambition of the American temperament , which will always spurn wealth for power .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 89]: The effects , therefore , of a democracy are , first to raise an inordinate ambition among the people , and then to cramp the very ambition which it has raised ; and , as I may comment upon hereafter , it appears as if this ambition of the people , _ individually _ checked by the nature of their institutions , becomes , as it were , concentrated and collected into a focus in upholding and contemplating the success and increase of power in the federal government .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 48]: Thus has been produced a species of demoralising reaction ; the disappointed _ units _ to a certain degree satisfying themselves with any advance in the power and importance of the whole Union , wholly regardless of the means by which such increase may have been obtained .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 19]: But this unsatisfied ambition has found another vent in the formation of many powerful religious and other associations .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 63]: In a country where there will ever be an attempt of the people to tyrannise over everybody and everything , power they will have ; and if they can not obtain it in the various departments of the States Governments , they will have it in opposition to the Government ; for all these societies and associations connect themselves directly with politics .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 6]: -LSB- See Note 1 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 34]: It is of little consequence by what description of tie `` these sticks in the fable '' are bound up together ; once bound together , they are , not to be broken .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 21]: In America religion severs the community , but these societies are the bonds which to a certain degree reunite it .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 21]: To enumerate the whole of these societies actually existing , or which have been in existence , would be difficult .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 23]: The following are the most prominent : -- _ List of Benevolent Societies , with their Receipts in the Year 1834 _ .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 27]: Many of these societies had not been established more than ten years at the date given ; they must have increased very much since that period .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 14]: Of course many of them are very useful , and very well conducted .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 25]: There are many others : New England Non-resistance Society , Sabbath Observance Society , etcetera ; in fact , the Americans are society mad .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 57]: I do not intend to speak with the least disrespect of the societies , but the zeal or fanaticism , if I may use the term , with which many , if not all , of them are carried on , is too remarkable a feature in the American character to be passed over without comment .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 39]: Many of these societies have done much good , particularly the religious societies ; but many others , from being pushed too far , have done great mischief , and have very much assisted to demoralise the community .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 56]: I remember once hearing a story of an ostler who confessed to a Catholic priest ; he enumerated a long catalogue of enormities peculiar to his profession , and when he had finished , the priest inquired of him `` whether he had ever greased horses ' teeth to prevent their eating their corn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 11]: this peculiar offence not having been mentioned in his confession .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 16]: The ostler declared that he never had , absolution was given , and he departed .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 49]: About six months afterwards , the ostler went again to unload his conscience ; the former crimes and peccadilloes were enumerated , but added to them were several acknowledgments of having at various times '' _ greased horses ' teeth _ '' to prevent their eating their corn .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 4]: `` Ho-ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 26]: cried the priest , `` why , if I recollect aright , according to your former confession you had never been guilty of this practice .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 15]: How comes it that you have added this crime to your many others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 29]: `` May it please you , Father , '' replied the ostler , `` I had _ never heard of it _ , until you told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 74]: Now this story is very _ apropos _ to the conduct pursued by many of these societies in America : they must display to the public their statistics of immorality and vice ; they must prove their usefulness by informing those who were quite ignorant , and therefore innocent , that there are crimes of which they had no idea ; and thus , in their fanatic wish to improve , they demoralise .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 12]: Such have been the consequences among this excitable yet well-meaning people .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 72]: The author of `` A voice from America '' observes : -- It has been thought suitable to call the attention of mothers and daughters over the wide country to the condition and evils of brothels and of common prostitution , in towns and cities ; to send out agents -- young men -- to preach on the subject ; and to organise subsidiary societies after the fashion of all reforms .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 42]: The annual report of `` The New York Female Moral Reform Society '' for 1838 , -LRB- a very decent name certainly for the object -RRB- , announces 361 auxiliaries and 20,000 members , with 16,500 subscribers -LRB- all females ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 42]: to the '' _ Advocate of Moral Reform _ , '' a semi-monthly paper , published by the parent society , devoted to the text of the seventh commandment , and to the facts and results growing out of its violation .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 111]: `` This same class of reformers have heretofore been accustomed to strike off prints of the most unmentionable scenes of these houses of pollution in their naked forms , and in the very acts of crime , for public display , that the public might know what they are : in other words , as may be imagined , to make sport for the initiated , to tempt the appetites and passions of the young , who otherwise would have known little or nothing about it , into the same vortex of ruin , and to cause the decent and virtuous to turn away with emotions of ineffable regret . ''
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 86]: I can not help inquiring , how is it , if the Americans are , as they assert , both orally and in their printed public documents , a _ very moral nation _ , that they find it necessary to resort to all these societies for the improvement of their brother citizens ; and how is it that their reports are full of such unexampled atrocities , as are printed and circulated in evidence of the necessity of their stemming the current of vice !
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 43]: The Americans were constantly twitting me about the occasional cases of adultery and divorce which appear in our newspapers , assuring me at the same time , that there was hardly ever such a thing heard of in their own moral community .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 119]: Now , it appears that this subject has not only been taken up by the clergy , -LRB- for Dr Dwight , late president of Yale College , preached a sermon on the seventh commandment , which an American author asserts `` was heard with pain and confusion of face , and which never can be read in a promiscuous circle without exciting the same feelings ; '' -RRB- but by one of their societies also ; and , although they have not assumed the name of the _ Patent Anti-Adultery Society _ , they are positively doing the work of such a one , and the details are entered into in promiscuous assemblies without the least reservation .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 95]: The author before mentioned says : `` The common feeling on the subject has been declared false delicacy ; and , in order to break ground against its sway , females have been forced into the van of this enterprise ; and persuaded to act as agents , not only among their own sex , but in circumstances where they must necessarily agitate the subject with men , -- not wives with husbands , which would be bad enough , but _ young and single women _ with _ young and single men _ !
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 39]: And we have been credibly informed , that attempts have been made to form associations among _ wives _ to regulate the privileges , and so attain the end of temperance , in the _ conjugal relation _ .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 55]: The next step , of course , will be teetotalism in this particular ; and , as a consequence , the extinction of the human race , unless peradventure the failure of the main enterprise of the _ Moral Reform Society _ should keep it up by a progeny not to be honoured . ''
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 9]: -LRB- `` A Voice from America . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 42]: Let it be remembered that this is not a statement of my own , but it is an _ American _ who makes the assertion , which I could prove to be true , might I publish what I must not .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 24]: From the infirmity of our natures , and our proneness to evil , there is nothing so corrupting as the statistics of vice .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 19]: Can young females remain pure in their ideas , who read with indifference details of the grossest nature ?
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 52]: Can the youth of a nation remain uncontaminated , who are continually poring over pages describing sensuality ; and will they not , in their desire of `` something new , '' as the Prophet says , run into the very vices of the existence of which they were before unconscious !
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 23]: It is this dangerous running into extremes which has occasioned so many of these societies to have been productive of much evil .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 39]: A Boston editor remarks : `` The tendency of the leaders of the moral and benevolent reforms of the day to run into fanaticism , threatens to destroy the really beneficial effects of all associations for these objects .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 21]: The spirit of propagandism , when it becomes over zealous , is next of kin to the spirit of persecution .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 26]: The benevolent associations of the day are on the brink of a danger that will be fatal to their farther usefulness if not checked . ''
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 18]: Of the Abolition Society and its tendency , I have already spoken in the chapter on slavery .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 44]: I must not , however , pass over another which at present is rapidly extending its sway over the whole Union , and it is difficult to say whether it does most harm or most good -- I refer to the Temperance Society .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 37]: The Rev Mr Reid says : `` In the short space of its existence , upwards of seven thousand Temperance Societies have been formed , embracing more than one million two hundred and fifty thousand members .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 24]: More than three thousand distilleries have been stopped , and more than seven thousand persons who dealt in spirits have declined the trade .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 10]: Upwards of one thousand vessels have abandoned their use .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 7]: And , most marvellous of all !
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 15]: it is said that above ten thousand drunkards have been reclaimed from intoxication . ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 29]: And he adds -- `` I really know of no one circumstance in the history of this people , or of any people , so exhilarating as this .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 22]: It discovers that power of self-government , which is the leading element of all national greatness , in an unexampled degree .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 23]: Now here is a remarkable instance of a traveller taking for granted that what is reported to him is the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 35]: The worthy clergyman , himself , evidently without guile , fully believed a statement which was absurd , from the simple fact , that only one side of the balance sheet had been presented .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 10]: That 7,000 Temperance Societies have been formed is true .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 43]: That 3,000 distilleries have stopped from principle may also be true ; but the Temperance Society reports take no notice of the many which have been _ set up in their stead _ by those who felt no compunction at selling spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 32]: Equally true it may be that 7,030 dealers in spirits have ceased to sell them ; but if they have declined the trade , _ others have taken it up _ .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 45]: That the crews of many vessels have abandoned the use of spirituous liquors is also the fact , and that is the greatest benefit which has resulted from the efforts of the Temperance Society ; but I believe the number to be greatly magnified .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 78]: That 10,000 drunkards have been reclaimed -- that is , that they have signed papers and taken the oath -- may be true ; but how many have fallen away from their good resolutions , and become more intemperate than before , is not recorded ; nor how many who , previously careless of liquor , have , out of pure opposition , and in defiance of the Society , actually become drunkards , is also unknown .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 24]: In this Society , as in the Abolition Society , they have canvassed for legislative enactments , and have succeeded in obtaining them .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 82]: The legislature of Massachusetts , which state is the stronghold of the society , passed an act last year by which it prohibited the selling of spirits in a smaller quantity than fifteen gallons , intending thereby to do away with the means of dram-drinking , at the groceries , as they are termed ; a clause , however , permitted apothecaries to retail smaller quantities , and the consequence was that all the grog-shops commenced taking out apothecaries ' licences .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 63]: That being stopped , the _ striped pig _ was resorted to : that is to say , a man charged people the value of a glass of liquor to see a _ striped pig _ , which peculiarity was exhibited as a sight , and , when in the house , the visitors were offered a glass of spirits for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 39]: But this act of the legislature has given great offence , and the state of Massachusetts is now divided into two very strange political parties , to wit , the _ topers _ and the _ teetotalers _ .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 55]: It is asserted that , in the political contest which is to take place , the topers will be victorious ; and if so , it will be satisfactorily proved that , in the very enlightened and moral state of Massachusetts the pattern of the Union , there are more intemperate than sober men .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 36]: In this dispute between sobriety and inebriety the clergy have not been idle : some denouncing alcohol from the pulpit ; some , on the other hand denouncing the Temperance Societies as not being Christians .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 12]: Among the latter the Bishop of Vermont has led the van .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 31]: In one of his works , `` The Primitive Church , '' he asserts that : -- `` The Temperance Society is not based upon religious , but worldly principles .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 29]: `` That it opposes vice and attempts to establish virtue in a manner which is not in accordance with the word of God , '' etcetera , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 12]: His argument is briefly this : -- The Scriptures forbid drunkenness .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 33]: If the people will not do right in obedience to the word of God , but only from the fear of public opinion , they show more respect to man than God .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 48]: The counter argument is : -- The Bible prohibits many other crimes , such as murder , theft , etcetera ; but if there were not punishments for these offences agreed upon by society , the fear of God would not prevent these crimes from being committed .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 41]: That in the United States public opinion has more influence than religion I believe to be the case ; and that in all countries present punishment is more to be considered than future is , I fear , equally true .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 33]: But I do not pretend to decide the question , which has occasioned great animosities , and on some occasions , I am informed , the dismissal of clergymen from their churches .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 71]: The teetotalers have carried their tenets to a length which threatens to invade the rites of the church , for a portion of them , calling themselves the Total Abstinence Society , will not use any wine which has alcohol in it , in taking the sacrament , and as there is no wine without a portion of alcohol ; they have invented a harmless mixture which they call wine .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 32]: Unfortunately , many of these Temperance Societies in their zeal , will admit of no medium party -- you must either abstain altogether , or be put down as a toper .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 18]: It is astonishing how obstinate some people are , and how great is the diversity of opinion .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 10]: I have heard many anecdotes relative to this question .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 12]: A man who indulged freely was recommended to join the society .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 26]: `` Now , '' said the minister , `` you must allow that there is nothing so good , so valuable to man as water .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 13]: What is the first thing you call for in sickness but water ?
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 10]: What else can cool your parched tongue like water ?
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 12]: What did the rich man ask for when in fiery torments ?
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 11]: What does the wretch ask for when on the rack ?
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 12]: You can not always drink spirits , but water you can .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 10]: Water costs nothing ; and you save your money .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 13]: Water never intoxicates , or prevents you from going to your work .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 6]: There is nothing like water .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 12]: Come now , Peter , let me hear your opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 22]: `` Well , then , sir , I think water is very good , very excellent indeed -- for navigation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 43]: An old Dutchman , who kept an inn at Hoboken , had long resisted the attacks of the Temperance Societies , until one night he happened to get so very drunk , that he actually signed the paper and took the oath .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 67]: The next morning he was made acquainted with what he had unconsciously done , and , much to the surprise of his friends , he replied , `` Well , if I have signed and have sworn , as you tell me I have , I must keep to my word ; '' and from that hour the old fellow abstained altogether from his favourite schnapps .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 15]: But the leaving off a habit which had become necessary had the usual result .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 15]: The old man took to his bed , and at last became seriously ill .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 39]: A medical man was called in , and when he was informed of what had occurred , perceived the necessity of some stimulus , and ordered that his patient should take one ounce of French brandy every day .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 18]: `` An ounce of French brandy , '' said the old Dutchman , looking at the prescription .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 15]: `` Well , dat is goot ; but how much is an ounce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 8]: Nobody who was present could inform him .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 36]: `` I know what a quart , a pint , or a gill of brandy is , '' said the Dutchman , `` but I never yet have had a customer call for an ounce .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 30]: Well , my son , go to the schoolmaster ; he is a learned man , and tell him I wish to know how much is one ounce . ''
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 5]: The message was carried .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 56]: The schoolmaster , occupied with his pupils , and not liking the interruption , hastily , and without further inquiries of the messenger , turned over his Bonnycastle , and arriving at the table of avoirdupois weight , replied , `` Tell your father that _ sixteen drams _ make an _ ounce _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 21]: The boy took back the message correctly , and when the old Dutchman heard it , his countenance brightened up .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 25]: `` A goot physician , a clever man -- I only have drank twelve drams a-day , and he tells me to take sixteen .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 49]: I have taken one oath when I was drunk , and I keep it ; now dat I am sober I take anoder , which is , I will be very sick for de remainder of my days , and never throw my physic out of window . ''
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 29]: There was a _ cold water _ celebration at Boston , on which occasion the hilarity of the evening was increased by the singing of the following ode .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 50]: Nobody will venture to assert that there is any _ spirit _ in the composition , and , judging from what I have seen of American manners and customs , I am afraid that the sentiments of the last four lines will not be responded to throughout the Union .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 2]: Ode .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 39]: In Eden 's green retreats A water-brook that played Between soft , and mossy seats Beneath a plane-tree 's shade , Whose rustling leaves Danced o'er its brink , Was Adam 's drink , And also Eve 's .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 41]: Beside the parent spring Of that young brook , the pair Their morning chaunt would sing ; And Eve , to dress her hair , Kneel on the grass That fringed its side , And made its tide Her looking-glass .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 41]: And when the man of God From Egypt led his flock , They thirsted , and his rod Smote the Arabian rock , And forth a rill Of water gushed , And on they rushed , And drank their fill .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 14]: Would Eden thus have smil 'd Had _ wine _ to Eden come ?
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 30]: Would Horeb 's parching wild Have been refreshed with _ rum _ And had Eve 's hair Been dressed in _ gin _ Would she have been Reflected fair ?
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 42]: Had Moses built a still And dealt out to that host , To every man his gill , And pledged him in a toast , How large a band Of Israel 's sons Had laid their bones In Canaan 's land ?
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 44]: Sweet fields , beyond Death 's flood , Stand dressed in living green , For , from the throne of God , To freshen all the scene , A river rolls , Where all who will May come and fill Their crystal bowls .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 51]: If Eden 's strength and bloom _ Cold water _ thus hath given -- If e ` en beyond the tomb , It is the drink of heaven -- Are not _ good wells _ , And _ crystal springs _ , _ The very things _ For our hotels ?
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 143]: As I shall return to the subject of intemperance in my examination of society , I shall conclude this chapter with an extract from Miss Martineau , whose work is a strange compound of the false and the true : -- `` My own convictions are , that associations , excellent as they are for mechanical objects , are not fit instruments for the achievement of moral aims ; that there has been no proof that the principle of self-restraint has been exalted and strengthened in the United States by the Temperance movement while the already too great regard to _ opinion _ , and subservience to spiritual encroachment , have been much increased ; and , therefore , great as may be the visible benefits of the institution , it may at length appear that they have been dearly purchased . ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 4]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note 1 .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 100]: Not long afterwards a prominent Presbyterian clergyman of Philadelphia thought fit to preach and publish a sermon , wherein it was set forth and conclusively proved , that on such and such contingencies of united religious effort of the religious public , the majority of the American people could be made _ religious _ ; consequently they might carry their _ religious influence _ to the _ polls _ ; consequently the religious would be able to turn all the profane _ out of office _ ; and consequently , the American people would become a _ Christian nation !
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 10]: -- Voice from America by an American Gentleman _ .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 7]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER FORTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 4]: REMARKS -- LAW .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 27]: The lawyers are the real aristocracy of America ; they comprehend nearly the whole of the gentility , talent , and liberal information of the Union .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 69]: Any one who has had the pleasure of being at one of their meetings , such as the Rent Club at New York , would be satisfied that there is no want of gentlemen with enlightened , liberal ideas in the United States ; but it is to the law , the navy , and the army , that you must chiefly look for this class of people .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 87]: Such must ever be the case in a democracy , where the mass are to be led ; the knowledge of the laws of the country , and the habit of public speaking being essential to those who would reside at the helm or assist in the evolutions : the consequence has been , that in every era of the Union , the lawyers have always been the most prominent actors ; and it may be added that they ever will play the most distinguished parts .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 22]: Clay and Webster of the present day are , and all the leading men of the former generation were , lawyers .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 45]: Their presidents have almost all been lawyers , and any deviation from this custom has been attended with evil results ; witness the elevation of General Jackson to the presidency , and the heavy price which the Americans have paid for their phantom glory .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 62]: The names of Judge Marshall and of Chancellor Kent are well known in this country , and most deservedly so : indeed , I am informed it has latterly been the custom in our own law courts , to cite as cases the decisions of many of the superior American judges -- a just tribute to their discrimination and their worth .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 80]: The general arrangement of that part of the American constitution relating to the judicature is extremely good , perhaps the best of all their legislative arrangements , yet it contains some great errors ; one of which is , that of district and inferior judges being _ elected _ , as it leaves the judge at the mercy of an excitable and overbearing people , who will attempt to dictate to him as they do to their spiritual teacher .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 21]: Occasionally he must choose whether he will decide as they wish , or lose his situation on the ensuing election .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 16]: Justice as well as religion will be interfered with by the despotism of the democracy .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 21]: The Americans are fond of law in one respect , that is , they are fond of going to law .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 15]: It is excitement to them , and not so expensive as in this country .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 16]: It is a pleasure which they can afford , and for which they cheerfully pay .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 51]: But , on the other hand , the very first object of the Americans , after a law has been passed , is to find out how they can evade it ; this exercises their ingenuity , and it is very amusing to observe how cleverly they sometimes manage it .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 24]: Every state enactment to uphold the morals , or for the better regulation of society , is immediately opposed by the sovereign people .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 65]: An act was passed to prohibit the playing of _ nine pins _ , -LRB- a very foolish act , as the Americans have so few amusements -RRB- : as soon as the law was put in force , it was notified every where , '' _ Ten _ pins played here , '' and they have been played every where , ever since .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 34]: Another act was passed to put down billiard tables , and in this instance every precaution was taken by an accurate description of the billiard table , that the law might be enforced .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 20]: Whereupon an extra _ pocket _ was added to the billiard table , and thus the law was evaded .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 31]: When I was at Louisville , a bill which had been brought in by congress , to prevent the numerous accidents which occurred in steam navigation , came into force .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 49]: Inspectors were appointed to see that the steam-boats complied with the regulations ; and those boats which were not provided according to law , did not receive the certificate from the inspectors , and were liable to a fine of five hundred dollars if they navigated without it .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 60]: A steam-boat was ready to start ; the passengers clubbed together and subscribed half the sum , -LRB- two hundred and fifty dollars -RRB- , and , as the informer was to have half the penalty , the captain of the boat went and informed against himself and received the other half ; and thus was the fine paid .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 87]: At Baltimore , in consequence of the prevalence of hydrophobia , the civic authorities passed a law , that all dogs should be muzzled , or , rather , the terms were , `` that all dogs should wear a muzzle , '' or the owner of a dog not wearing a muzzle , should be brought up and fined ; and the regulation farther stated that anybody convicted of having , `` removed the muzzle from off a dog should also be severely fined . ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 27]: A man , therefore , tied a muzzle to his dog 's tail -LRB- the act not stating where the muzzle was to be placed -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 41]: One of the city officers , perceiving this dog with his muzzle at the wrong end , took possession of the dog and brought it to the town-hall ; its master being well known , was summoned , and appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 51]: He proved that he had complied with the act , in having fixed a muzzle on the dog ; and , farther , the city officer having taken the _ muzzle off _ the dog 's tail , he insisted that he should be fined five dollars for so doing .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 38]: The _ striped _ pig , I have already mentioned ; but were I to relate all I have been told upon this head , it would occupy too much of the reader 's time and patience .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 78]: The mass of the citizens of the United States have certainly a very great dislike to all law except their own , i.e. , the decision of the majority ; and it must be acknowledged that it is not only the principle of equality , but the parties who are elected as district judges , that , by their own conduct , contribute much to that want of respect with which they are treated in their courts .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 74]: When a judge on his bench sits half-asleep , with his hat on , and his coat and shoes off ; his heels kicking upon the railing or table which is as high or higher than his head ; his toes peeping through a pair of old worsted stockings , and with a huge quid of tobacco in his cheek , you can not expect that much respect will be paid to him .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 15]: Yet such is even now the practice in the interior of the western states .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 47]: I was much amused at reading an English critique upon a work by Judge Hall -LRB- a district judge -RRB- , in which the writer says , `` We can imagine his honour in all the solemnity of his flowing wig , '' etcetera , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 53]: The last time I saw his _ honour _ he was cashier to a bank at Cincinnati , thumbing American bank-notes -- dirtier work than is ever practised in the lowest grade of the law , as any one would say if he had ever had any American bank-notes in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 18]: As may be supposed , in a new country like America , many odd scenes take place .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 58]: In the towns in the interior , a lawyer 's office is generally a small wooden house , of one room , twelve feet square , built of clapboards , and with the door wide open ; and the little domicile with its tenant used to remind me of a spider in its web waiting for flies .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 49]: Not forty years back , on the other side of the Alleghany mountains , deer skins at forty cents per pound , and the furs of other animals at a settled price , were _ legal _ tender , and received both by judges and lawyers as fees .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 85]: The lawyers in the towns on the banks of the Susquehannah , where it appears the people , -LRB- notwithstanding Campbell 's beautiful description , -RRB- were extremely litigious , used to receive all their fees in kind , such as skins , corn , whiskey , etcetera , etcetera , and , as soon as they had sufficient to load a raft , were to be seen gliding down the river to dispose of their cargo at the first favourable mart for produce .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 21]: Had they worn the wigs and gown of our own legal profession , the effect would have been more picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 18]: There is a record of a very curious trial which occurred in the state of New York .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 38]: A man had lent a large iron , kettle , or boiler , to another , and it being returned _ cracked _ , an action was brought against the borrower for the value of the kettle .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 42]: After the plaintiff 's case had been heard , the counsel for the defendant rose and said : -- `` Mister Judge , we defend this action upon three counts , all of which we shall most satisfactorily prove to you .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 24]: `` In the first place , we will prove , by undoubted evidence , that the kettle was cracked when we borrowed it .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 18]: `` In the second , that the kettle , when we returned it was whole and sound .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 19]: `` And in the third , we will prove that we never borrowed the kettle at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 38]: There is such a thing as proving too much , but one thing is pretty fairly proved in this case , which is , that the defendant 's counsel must have originally descended from the Milesian stock .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 26]: I have heard many amusing stories of the peculiar eloquence of the lawyers in the newly settled western states , where metaphor is so abundant .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 33]: One lawyer was so extremely metaphorical upon an occasion , when the stealing of a pig was the case in point , that at last he got to `` coruscating rays . ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 49]: The judge -LRB- who appeared equally metaphorical -- himself -RRB- thought proper to pull him up by saying : -- `` Mr -- , I wish you would take the feathers from the wings of your imagination , and put them into the tail of your judgment . ''

Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 12]: -- A Court-house not fifty miles from the city of Louisville .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 6]: Judge presiding with great dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 8]: A noise is heard before the door .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 8]: He looks up , fired with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 46]: -- ` Mr Sheriff , sir , bring them men in here ; this in the temple of liberty -- this in the sanctuary of justice , and it shall not be profaned by the cracking of nuts and the eating of gingerbread . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 6]: -- _ Marblehead Register _ .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 29]: I have already observed that there is a great error in the office of the inferior and district judges being elective , but there are others equally serious .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 11]: In the first place the judges are not sufficiently paid .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 31]: Captain Hamilton remarks : -- `` The low salaries of the judges constitute matter of general complaint among the members of the bar , both at Philadelphia and New York .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 33]: These are so inadequate , when compared with the income of a well-employed barrister , that the state is deprived of the advantage of having the highest legal talent on the bench .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 53]: Men from the lower walks of the profession , therefore , are generally promoted to the office ; and for the sake of a wretched saving of a few thousand dollars , the public are content to submit their lives and properties to the decision of men of inferior intelligence and learning .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 17]: `` In one respect , I am told , the very excess of democracy defeats itself .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 28]: In some states the judges are so inordinately underpaid , that no lawyer who does not possess a considerable private fortune can afford to accept the office .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 42]: From this circumstance , something of aristocratic distinction has become connected with it , and a seat on the bench is now more greedily coveted than it would be were the salary more commensurate with the duties of the situation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 18]: The next error is , that political questions are permitted to interfere with the ends of justice .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 79]: It is a well-known fact that , not long ago , an Irishman , who had murdered his wife , was brought to trial upon the eve of an election ; and , although his guilt was undoubted , he was acquitted , because the Irish party , which were so influential as to be able to turn the election , had declared that , if their countryman was convicted , they would vote on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 20]: But worst of all is the difficulty of finding an _ honest _ jury -- a fact generally acknowledged .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 44]: Politics , private animosities , bribery , all have their influence to defeat the ends of justice , and it argues strongly against the moral standard of a nation that such should be the case ; but that it is so is undoubted .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 6]: -LSB- See Note 1 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 28]: The truth is that the juries , have no respect for the judges , however respectable they may be , and as many of them really are .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 13]: The feeling `` I 'm as good as he '' operates everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 39]: There is no shutting up a jury and starving them out as with us ; no citizen , `` free and enlightened , aged twenty-one , white , '' would submit to such an invasion of his rights .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 54]: Captain Hamilton observes : -- `` It was not without astonishment , I confess , that I remarked that three-fourths of the jury-men were engaged in eating bread and cheese , and that the foreman actually announced the verdict with his mouth full , ejecting the disjointed syllables during the intervals of mastication !
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 54]: In truth , an American seems to look on a judge exactly as he does on a carpenter or coppersmith ; and it never occurs to him , that an administrator of justice is entitled to greater respect than a constructor of brass knockers , or the sheather of a ship 's bottom .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 43]: The judge and the brazier are paid equally for their work ; and Jonathan firmly believes that , while he has money in his pocket , there is no risk of suffering from the want either of law or warming pans . ''
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 40]: One most notorious case of bribery , I can vouch for , as I am acquainted with the two parties , one of whom purchased the snuff-box in which the other enclosed the notes and presented to the jurymen .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 46]: A gentleman at New York of the name of Stoughton , had a quarrel with another of the name of Goodwin : the latter followed the former down the street , and murdered him in open day by passing a small sword through his body .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 42]: The case was as clear as a case could be , but there is a great dislike to capital punishment in America , and particularly was there in this instance , as the criminal was of good family and extensive connections .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 40]: It was ascertained that all the jury except two intended to acquit the prisoner upon some pretended want of evidence , but that these two had determined that the law should take its course , and were quite inexorable .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 37]: Before the jury retired to consult upon the verdict , it was determined by the friends of the prisoner that an attempt should be made by bribery to soften down the resolution of these two men .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 42]: As they were retiring , a snuff-box was put into the hands of one of them by a gentleman , with the observation that he and his friend would probably find a pinch of snuff agreeable after so long a trial .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 17]: The snuff-box contained bank notes to the amount of 2,500 dollars -LRB- 500 pounds sterling -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 15]: The snuff-box and its contents were not returned , and the prisoner was acquitted .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 32]: The unwillingness to take away life is a very remarkable feature in America , and were it not carried to such an extreme length , would be a very commendable one .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 13]: An instance of this occurred just before my arrival at New York .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 37]: A young man by the name of Robinson , who was a clerk in an importing house , had formed a connection with a young woman on the town , of the name of Ellen Jewitt .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 39]: Not having the means to meet her demands upon his purse , he had for many months embezzled from the store goods to a very large amount , which she had sold to supply her wants or wishes .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 27]: At last , Robinson , probably no longer caring for the girl , and aware that he was in her power , determined upon murdering her .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 8]: Such accumulated crime can hardly be conceived !
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 43]: He went to sleep with her , made her drunk with champagne before they retired to bed , and then as she lay in bed murdered her with an axe , which he had brought with him from his master 's store .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 99]: The house of ill-fame in which he visited her was at that time full of other people of both sexes , who had retired to rest -- it is said nearly one hundred were there on that night , thoughtless of the danger to which they were exposed , fearful that the murder of the young woman would be discovered and brought home to him , the miscreant resolved to set fire to the house , and by thus sending unprepared into the next world so many of his fellow creatures , escape the punishment which he deserved .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 36]: He set fire to the bed upon which his unfortunate victim laid , and having satisfied himself that his work was securely done , locked the door of the room , and quitted the premises .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 25]: A merciful Providence , however , directed otherwise ; the fire was discovered , and the flames extinguished , and his crime made manifest .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 57]: The evidence in an English court would have been more than sufficient to convict him ; but in America , such is the feeling against taking life that , strange to say , Robinson was acquitted , and permitted to leave for Texas , where it is said , he still lives under a false name .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 61]: I have heard this subject canvassed over and over again in New York ; and , although some , with a view of extenuating to a foreigner such a disgraceful disregard to security of life , have endeavoured to show that the evidence was not quite satisfactory , there really was not a shadow of doubt in the whole case .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 4]: See Note 2 .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 12]: But leniency towards crime is the grand characteristic of American legislation .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 74]: Whether it proceeds , -LRB- as I much suspect it does , -RRB- from the national vanity being unwilling to admit that such things can take place among `` a very moral people , '' or from a more praiseworthy feeling , I am not justified in asserting : the reader must form his own opinion , when he has read all I have to say upon other points connected with the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 23]: I have been very much amused with the reports of the sentences given by my excellent friend the recorder of New York .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 55]: He is said to be one of the soundest lawyers in the Union , and a very worthy man ; but I trust say , that as recorder , he does not add to the dignity of the bench by his facetious remarks , and the peculiar lenity he occasionally shows to the culprits .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 4]: See Note 3 .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 38]: I will give an extract from the newspapers of some of the proceedings an his court , as they will , I am convinced , be as amusing to the reader as they have been to me .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 34]: The Recorder then called out -- `` Mr Crier , make the usual proclamation ; '' `` Mr Clerk , call out the prisoners , and let us proceed to sentencing them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 4]: _ Clerk _ .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 7]: Put Stephen Schofield to the bar .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 4]: It was done .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 4]: _ Clerk _ .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 42]: Prisoner , you may remember you have heretofore been indicted for a certain crime by you committed ; upon your indictment you were arraigned ; upon your arraignment you pleaded guilty , and threw yourself upon the mercy of the court .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 19]: What have you now to say , why judgment should not be passed upon you according to law .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 12]: The prisoner , who was a bad-looking mulatto , was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 28]: Schofield , you have been convicted of a very bad crime ; you attempted to take liberties with a young white girl -- a most serious offence .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 35]: This is getting to be a very bad crime , and practised , I am sorry to say , to a great extent in this community : it must be put a stop to .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 20]: Had you been convicted of the whole crime , we should have sent you to the state-prison for life .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 43]: As it is , we sentence you to hard labour in the state-prison at Sing Sing for five years ; and that 's the judgment of the court ; and when you come out , take no more liberties with white girls .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 4]: _ Prisoner _ .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 9]: Thank your honour it ai n't no worse .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 4]: _ Clerk _ .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 5]: Bring out Mary Burns .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 4]: It was done .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 4]: _ Clerk _ .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 34]: Prisoner , you may remember , etcetera , etcetera , upon your arraignment you pleaded not guilty , and put yourself on your country for trial ; which country hath found you guilty .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 18]: What have you now to say why judgment should not be pronounced upon you according to law ?
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 4]: -LRB- Silent -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 12]: Mary Burns , Mrs Forgay gave you her chemise to wash .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 4]: _ Prisoner _ .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 10]: No , she did n't give it to me .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 12]: But you got it somehow , and you stole the money .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 59]: Now , you see , our respectable fellow-citizens , the ladies , must have their chemises washed , and , to do so , they must put confidence in their servants ; and they have a right to sew their money up in their chemise if they think proper , and servants must not steal it from them .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 59]: As you 're a young woman , and not married , it would not be right to deprive you of the opportunity to get a husband for five years ; so we shall only send you to Sing Sing for two years and six months ; the keeper will work you in whatever way he may think proper .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 6]: -- Go to the next .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 13]: Charles Liston was brought out and arraigned , _ pro forma _ .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 6]: He was a dark negro .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 4]: _ Clerk _ .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 12]: Liston , what have you to say why judgment , etcetera ?
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 4]: _ Prisoner _ .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 34]: All I got to say to his honour de honourable court is , dat I see de error of my ways , and I hope dey may soon see de error of deirs .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 22]: I broke de law of my free country , and I must lose my liberty , and go to Sing Sing .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 50]: But I trow myself on de mercy of de Recorder ; and all I got to say to his honour , de honourable Richard Riker , is , dat I hope he 'll live to be de next mayor of New York till I come out of Sing Sing .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 7]: _ Recorder -LRB- laughing -RRB- _ .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 5]: A very good speech !
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 16]: But , Liston , whether I 'm mayor or not , you must suffer some .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 21]: This stealing from entries is a most pernicious crime , and one against which our respectable fellow-citizens can scarcely guard .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 21]: Two-thirds of our citizens hang their hats and coats in entries , and we must protect their hats and coats .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 19]: We , therefore , sentence you to Sing Sing for five years , -- Go to the next .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 11]: John Mcdonald and Godfrey Crawluck were put to the bar .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 9]: Mcdonald and Crawluck , you stole two beeves .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 20]: Now , however much I like beef , I 'd he very hungry before I 'd steal any beef .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 9]: You are on the high road to ruin .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 23]: You went up the road to Harlem , and down the road to Yorkville , and you 'll soon go to destruction .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 54]: We shall send you to Sing Sing for two years each ; and when you come out , take your mother 's maiden name , and lead a good life , and do n't eat any more beef -- I mean , do n't steal any more beeves -- Go to the next .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 5]: Luke Staken was arraigned .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 21]: -- Staken , you slept in a room with Lahay , and stole all his gold -LRB- 1000 dollars -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 49]: This sleeping in rooms with other people , and stealing their things , is a serious offence , and practised to a great extent in this city ; and what makes the matter worse , you stole one thousand dollars in specie , when specie is so scarce .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 10]: We send you to Sing Sing for five years .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 5]: Jacob Williams was arraigned .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 17]: He looked as if he had not many days to live , though a young man .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 23]: Williams , you stole a lot of kerseymere from a store , and ran off with it -- a most pernicious crime !
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 24]: But , as your health is not good , we shall only send you to Sing Sing for three years and six months .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 6]: John H Murray was arraigned .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 8]: Murray , you 're a deep fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 29]: You got a Green Mountain boy into an alley , and played at `` shuffle and burn , '' and you burned him out of a hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 72]: You must go to Sing Sing for five years ; and we hope the reputable reporters attending for the respectable public press will warn our respectable country friends , when they come into New York , not to go into Orange street , and play at `` shuffle and burn '' among bad girls and bad men , or they 'll very likely get burnt , like this Green Mountain boy .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 6]: -- Go to the next .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 14]: William Shay , charged with shying glasses at the head of a tavern-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 2]: Guilty .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 47]: This rioting is a very bad crime , Shay , and deserves heavy punishment ; but as we understand you have a wife and sundry little Shays , we 'll let you off , provided you give your solemn promise never to do so any more .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 4]: _ Shay _ .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 7]: I gives it -- wery solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 5]: Then we discharge you .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 4]: _ Shay _ .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 11]: Thank your honour -- your honour 's a capital judge .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 9]: John Bowen , charged with stealing a basket .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 2]: Guilty .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 33]: Now , John , we 've convicted you ; and you 'll have to get out stone for three months on Blackwell 's Island -- that 's the judgment of the court .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 47]: Buckley and Charles Rogers , charged with loafing , sleeping in the park , and leaving the gate open , were discharged , with a caution to take care how they interfered with corporation rights in future , or they would get their corporation into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 14]: Ann Boyle , charged with being too _ lively _ in the street .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 13]: Let off on condition of being quiet for the time to come .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 8]: Thomas Dixon , charged with petty larceny .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 2]: Guilty .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 4]: _ Dixon _ .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 7]: I wish to have judgment suspended .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 16]: It 's a bad time to talk about suspension ; why do you request this ?
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 4]: _ Dixon _ .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 13]: I 've an uncle I want to see , and other relations .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 26]: In that case we 'll send you to Black well 's island for six months , you 'll be sure to find them all there .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 3]: Sentence accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 26]: Charles Enroff , charged with petty larceny -- coming Paddy over an Irish shoemaker , and thereby cheating him out of a pair of shoes .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 3]: -- Guilty .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 18]: Sentenced to the penitentiary , Blackwell 's island , for six months , to get out stone .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 10]: Charles Thorn , charged with assaulting Miss Rachael Prigmore .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 11]: Miss Prigmore , how came this man to strike you ?
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 4]: _ Rachael _ .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 7]: Because I would n't have him .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 5]: -LRB- A laugh . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 27]: He was always a teasing me , and spouting poetry about roses and thorns ; so when I told him to be off he struck me .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 7]: _ Prisoner _ -LRB- theatrically -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 4]: Me strike you !
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 24]: Oh , Rachael -- `` Perhaps it was right to dissemble your love , But why did you kick me down stairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 6]: _ Prisoner 's Counsel _ .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 7]: That 's it , your honour .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 8]: Why did she kick him down stairs ?
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 14]: This the fair Rachael indignantly denied , and the prisoner was found guilty .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 19]: This striking of women is a very bad crime , you must get out stone for two months .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 4]: _ Prisoner _ .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 7]: She 'll repent , your honour .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 9]: She loves me -- I know she does .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 25]: `` On the cold flinty rock , when I 'm busy at work , Oh , Rachael , I 'll think of thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 8]: Thomas Ward , charged with petty larceny .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 2]: Guilty .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 24]: Ward had nothing to offer to _ ward _ off his sentence , therefore he was sent to the island for six months .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 8]: Maria Brandon , charged with petty larceny .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 2]: Guilty .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 8]: Sentenced to pick oakum for six months .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 4]: _ Maria _ .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 28]: Well , I 've friends , that 's comfort , they 'll sing -- `` Oh , come to this bower , my own stricken deer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 4]: _ Recorder _ .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 18]: You 're right , Maria , it 's an _ oakum _ bower you 're going to .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 5]: The court then adjourned .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 4]: See Note 4 .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 18]: But all these are nothing compared with the following , which at first I did not credit .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 19]: I made the strictest inquiry , and was informed by a legal gentleman present that it was correct .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 11]: I give the extract as it stood in the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 8]: _ Influence of a Pretty Girl _ .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 26]: -- `` Catherine Manly , '' said the Recorder yesterday , in the sessions , `` you have been convicted of a very bad crime .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 19]: This stealing is a very serious offence ; but , _ as you are a pretty girl _ !
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 16]: we 'll suspend judgment , in hopes you will do better for the future . ''
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 9]: We have often heard that justice was blind .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 7]: What a fib to say so !
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 28]: Mr Carey , in his publication on Wealth , asserts , that security of property and or person are greater in the United States than in England .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 12]: How far he is correct I shall now proceed to examine .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 54]: Mr Carey says , in his observations on security of person : -- `` Comparing Massachusetts with England and Wales , we find in the former 1 in 86,871 sentenced to one year 's imprisonment or more ; whereas , in the latter 1 in 70,000 is sentenced to more than one year .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 16]: The number sentenced to one year or more in England is greater than in Pennsylvania .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 30]: It is obvious , therefore , that security is much greater in Massachusetts than in England , and consequently greater than in any other part of the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 61]: Relative to crimes against security of property , he asserts : -- Of crimes against property , involving punishments of one year 's imprisonment , or more , we find : -- While in England , in the year 1834 , their convictions for offences against property , involving punishments exceeding one year 's imprisonment , was 1 in 3,120 .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 53]: Now , that these numbers are fairly given , as far as they go , I have no doubt ; but the comparison is not just , because , first , in America crime is not so easily detected ; and , secondly , when detected , conviction does not always follow .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 62]: Mr Carey must be well aware that , in the American newspapers , you _ continually _ meet with a paragraph like this : -- `` A body of a white man , or of a negro , was found floating near such and such a wharf , on Saturday last , with evident marks of violence upon it , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 22]: etcetera , and the coroner 's inquest is returned either found drowned , or violence by person or persons unknown . ''
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 104]: Now , let Mr Carey take a list from the coroner 's books of the number of bodies found in this manner at New York , and the number of instances in which the perpetrators have been discovered ; let him compare this list with a similar one made for England and Wales , and he will then ascertain the difference between the _ crimes committed _ in proportion to the _ convictions _ which take place through the activity of the police in our country , and , it may be said , the total want of police in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 75]: As to the second point , namely , that when crimes are detected , conviction does not follow , -LSB- see Note 5 -RSB- I have only to refer back to the cases of Robinson and Goodwin , two instances out of the many in which criminals in the United States are allowed to escape , who , if they had committed the same offence in England , would most certainly have been hanged .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 44]: But there is another point which renders Mr Carey 's statement unfair , which is , that he has no right to select one , two , or even three states out of twenty-six , and compare them all with England and Wales .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 19]: The question is , the comparative security of person and property in Great Britain and the United States .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 44]: I acknowledge that , if Ireland were taken into the account , it would very much reduce our proportional numbers ; but , then , there crime is _ fomented _ by traitors and demagogues -- a circumstance which must not be overlooked .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 68]: Still , the whole of Ireland would offer nothing equal in atrocity to what I can prove relative to one small town in America : that of Augusta , in Georgia , containing only a population of 3,000 , in which , in one year , there were _ fifty-nine assassinations _ committed in open day , without any notice being taken of them by the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 69]: This , alone , will exceed all Ireland , and I therefore do not hesitate to assert , that if every crime committed in the United States were followed up by conviction , as it would be in Great Britain , the result would fully substantiate the fact , that , in security of person and property , the advantage is considerably in favour of my own country .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 4]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note 1 .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 40]: Miss Martineau , speaking of the jealousy between the Americans and the French creoles , says -- `` No American expects to get a verdict , on _ any evidence _ , from a jury of French creoles . ''

Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 26]: America though little more than sixty years old as a nation , has already published an United States Criminal Calendar -LRB- Boston , 1835 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 34]: I have this book in my possession , and , although in number of criminals it is not quite equal to our Newgate Calendar , it far exceeds it in atrocity of crime .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 3]: Note 3 .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 30]: Some allowance must be made for the license of the reporters , but in the main it is a very fair specimen of the recorder 's style and language .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 3]: Note 4 .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 39]: There is , as will appear by the quotations , as much fun in the police reports in New York as in the best of ours : the _ style _ of the Recorder is admirably taken off .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 3]: Note 5 .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 32]: Miss Martineau , speaking of a trial for murder in the United States , says , `` I observed that no one seemed to have a doubt of his guilt . ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 35]: She replied , that there never was a clearer case : but that he would be acquitted ; the examination and trial were a mere form , of which everyone knew the conclusion beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 36]: The people did not choose to see any more hanging , and till the law was so altered as to allow an alternative of punishment , no conviction for a capital offence would be obtainable .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 26]: I asked on what pretence the young man would be got off , if the evidence against him was as clear as it was represented .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 14]: She said some one would be found to swear an _ alibi _ .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 29]: `` A tradesman swore an _ alibi _ ; the young man was acquitted , and the next morning he was on his way to the West . ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 7]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER FORTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 5]: REMARKS -- LYNCH LAW .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 66]: Englishmen express their surprise that in a moral community such a monstrosity as Lynch law should exist ; but although the present system , which has been derived from the original Lynch law , can not be too severely condemned , it must , in justice to the Americans , be considered that the original custom of Lynch law was forced upon them by circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 65]: Why the term of Lynch law has been made use of , I do not know ; but in its origin the practice was no more blameable than were the laws established by the Pilgrim fathers on their first landing at Plymouth , or any law enacted amongst a community left to themselves , their own resources , and their own guidance and government .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 97]: Lynch law , as at first constituted , was nothing more than punishment awarded to offenders by a community who bed been injured , and who had no law to refer to , and could have no redress if they did not take the law into their own hands ; the _ present _ system of Lynch law is , on the contrary , an illegal exercise of the power of the majority in opposition to and defiance of the laws of the country , and the measure of justice administered and awarded by those laws .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 101]: It must be remembered that fifty years ago , there were but a few white men to the westward of the Alleghany Mountains ; that the states of Kentucky and Tennessee were at that time as scanty in population , as even now are the districts of Ioway and Columbia ; that by the institutions of the Union a district required a certain number of inhabitants before it could be acknowledged as even a district ; and that previous to such acknowledgment , the people who had _ squatted _ on the land had no claim to protection or law .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 66]: It must also be borne in mind , that these distant territories offered an asylum to many who fled from the vengeance of the laws , men without principle , thieves , rogues , and vagabonds , who escaping there , would often interfere with the happiness and peace of some small yet well-conducted community , which had migrated and settled on these fertile regions .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 16]: These communities had no appeal against personal violence , no protection from rapacity and injustice .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 60]: They were not yet within the pale of the Union ; indeed there are many even now in this precise situation -LRB- that of the Mississippi for instance , -RRB- who have been necessitated to make laws of government for themselves , and who acting upon their own responsibilities , do very often condemn to death , and execute .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 5]: -LSB- Note 1 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 47]: It was , therefore , to remedy the defect of their being no established law , that Lynch law , as it is termed , was applied to ; without it , all security , all social happiness would have been in a state of abeyance .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 69]: By degrees , all disturbers of the public peace , all offenders against justice met with their deserts ; and as it is a query , whether on its first institution , any law from the bench was more honestly and impartially administered than this very Lynch law , which has now had its name prostituted by the most barbarous excesses and contemptuous violation of all law whatever .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 37]: The examples I am able to bring forward of Lynch law , in its primitive state , will be found to have been based upon necessity , and a due regard to morals and to justice .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 36]: For instance , the harmony of a well-conducted community would be interfered with by some worthless scoundrel , who would entice the young men to gaming , or the young women to deviate from virtue .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 22]: He becomes a nuisance to the community , and in consequence the heads or elders would meet and vote his expulsion .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 42]: Their method was very simple and straight-forward ; he was informed that his absence would be agreeable , and that if he did not `` clear out '' before a certain day , he would receive forty lashes with a cow-hide .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 42]: If the party thought proper to defy this notice , as soon as the day arrived he received the punishment , with a due notification that , if found there again after a certain time , the dose would be repeated .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 23]: By these means they rid the community of a bad subject , and the morals of the junior branches were not contaminated .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 11]: Such was in its origin the practice of Lynch law .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 15]: A circumstance occurred within these few years in which Lynch law was duly administered .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 13]: At Dubuque , in the Ioway district , a murder was committed .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 58]: The people of Dubuque first applied to the authorities of the state of Michigan , but they discovered that the district of Ioway was not within the jurisdiction of that State ; and , in fact , although on the opposite side of the river there was law and justice , they had neither to appeal to .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 36]: They would not allow the murderer to escape ; they consequently met , selected among themselves a judge and a jury , tried the man , and , upon their own responsibility , hanged him .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 31]: There was another instance which occurred a short time since at Snakes ' Hollow , on the western side of the Mississippi , not far from the town of Dubuque .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 41]: A band of miscreants , with a view of obtaining possession of some valuable diggings -LRB- lead mines , -RRB- which were in the possession of a grocer who lived in that place , murdered him in the open day .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 18]: The parties were well known , but they held together and would none of them give evidence .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 44]: As there were no hopes of their conviction , the people of Snakes ' Hollow armed themselves , seized the parties engaged in the transaction , and ordered them to quit the territory on pain of having a rifle-bullet through their heads immediately .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 16]: The scoundrels crossed the river in a canoe , and were never after heard of .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 50]: I have collected these facts to show that Lynch law has been forced upon the American settlers in the western states by _ circumstances _ ; that it has been acted upon in support of morality and virtue , and that its awards have been regulated by strict justice .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 58]: But I must now notice this practice with a view to show how dangerous it is that any law should be meted out by the majority , and that what was commenced from a sense of justice and necessity , has now changed into a defiance of law , where law and justice can be readily obtained .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 93]: The Lynch law of the present day , as practised in the states of the west and south , may be divided into two different heads : the first is , the administration of it in cases in which the laws of the states are considered by the majority as not having awarded a punishment adequate , in their opinion , to the offence committed ; and the other , when from excitement the majority will not wait for the law to act , but inflict the punishment with their own hands .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 9]: The following are instances under the first head .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 18]: Every crime increases in magnitude in proportion as it affects the welfare and interest of the community .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 28]: Forgery and bigamy are certainly crimes , but they are not such heavy crimes as many others to which the same penalty is decreed in this country .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 31]: But in a commercial nation forgery , from its effects , becomes most injurious , as it destroys confidence and security of property , affecting the whole mass of society .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 60]: A man may have his pocket _ picked _ of 1000 pounds or more , but this is not a capital offence , as it is only the individual who suffers ; but if a man _ forges _ a bill for 5 pounds he is -LRB- or rather , was -RRB- sentenced by our laws to be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 42]: Bigamy may be adduced as another instance : the heinousness of the offence is not in having more than one wife , but in the prospect of the children of the first marriage being left to be supported by the community .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 10]: Formerly , that was also pronounced a capital offence .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 29]: Of punishments , it will be observed that society has awarded the most severe for crimes committed against itself , rather than against those which most offend God .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 67]: Upon this principle , in the southern and western states , you may murder _ ten _ white men and no one will arraign you or trouble himself about the matter ; but _ steal one nigger _ , and the whole community are in arms , and express the most virtuous indignation against the sin of theft , although that of murder will be disregarded .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 25]: One or two instances in which Lynch law was called in to _ assist _ justice on the bench , came to my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 36]: A Yankee had stolen a slave , but as the indictment was not properly worded , he knew that he would be acquitted , and he boasted so , previous to the trial coming on .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 20]: He was correct in his supposition ; the flaw in the indictment was fatal , and he was acquitted .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 30]: `` I told you so , '' said he , triumphantly smiling as he left the court , to the people who had been the issue of the trial .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 34]: `` Yes , '' replied they , `` it is true that you have been acquitted by Judge Smith , but you have not yet been tried by _ Judge _ Lynch . ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 7]: The latter judge was very summary .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 31]: The Yankee was tied up , and cow-hided till he was nearly dead ; they then put him into a _ dug-out _ and sent him floating down the river .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 28]: Another instance occurred which is rather amusing , and , at the same time , throws some light upon the peculiar state of society in the west .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 100]: There was a bar-keeper at some tavern in the state of Louisiana -LRB- if I recollect right -RRB- who was a great favourite ; whether from his judicious mixture of the proportions of mint juleps and gin cocktails , or from other causes , I do not know ; but what may appear strange to the English , he was elected to an office in the law courts of the state , similar to our _ Attorney-General _ , and I believe was very successful , for an American can turn his hand or his head to almost anything .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 27]: It so happened that a young man who was in prison for stealing a negro , applied to this attorney-general to defend him in the court .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 39]: This he did so successfully that the man was acquitted ; but Judge Lynch was as usual waiting outside , and when the attorney came out with his client , the latter was demanded to be given up .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 14]: This the attorney refused , saying that the man was under his protection .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 45]: A tumult ensued , but the attorney was firm ; he drew his Bowie-knife , and addressing the crowd , said , `` My men , you all know me : no one takes this man , unless he passes over my body . ''
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 47]: The populace were still dissatisfied , and the attorney not wishing to lose his popularity , and at the same time wanting to defend a man who had paid him well , requested the people to be quiet a moment until he could arrange the affair .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 68]: He took his client aside , and said to him , `` These men will have you , and will Lynch you , in spite of all my efforts , only one chance remains for you , and you must accept it : you know that it is but a mile to the confines of the next state , which if you gain you will be secure .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 33]: You have been in prison for two months , you have lived on bread and water , and you must be in good wind , moreover , you are young and active .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 22]: These men who wish to get hold of you are half drunk , and they never can run as you can .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 28]: Now , I 'll propose that you have one hundred and fifty yards law , and then if you exert yourself , you can easily escape . ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 34]: The man consented , as he could not help himself : the populace also consented , as the attorney pointed out to them that any other arrangement would be injurious to his honour .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 40]: The man , however , did not succeed ; he was so frightened that he could not run , and in a short time he was taken , and had the usual allowance of cow-hide awarded by Judge Lynch .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 22]: Fortunately he regained his prison before he was quite exhausted , and was sent away during the night in a steamer .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 25]: At Natchez , a young man married a young lady of fortune , and , in his passion , actually flogged her to death .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 55]: He was tried , but as there were no witnesses but negroes , and their evidence was not admissible against a white man , he was acquitted : but he did not escape ; he was seized , tarred and feathered , _ scalped _ , and turned adrift in a canoe without paddles .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 27]: Such are the instances of Lynch law being superadded , when it has been considered by the majority that the law has not been sufficiently severe .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 29]: The other variety of Lynch law is , when they will not wait for law , but , in a state of excitement , proceed to summary punishment .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 32]: The case more than once referred to by Miss Martineau , of the burning alive of a coloured man at St Louis , is one of the gravest under this head .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 72]: I do not wish to defend it in any way , but I do , for the honour of humanity , wish to offer all that can be said in extenuation of this atrocity : and I think Miss Martineau , when she held up to public indignation the monstrous punishment , was bound to acquaint the public with the cause of an excitable people being led into such an error .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 39]: This unfortunate victim of popular fury was a free coloured man , of a very quarrelsome and malignant disposition ; he had already been engaged in a variety of disputes , and was a nuisance in the city .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 43]: For an attempt to murder another coloured man , he was seized , and was being conducted to prison in the custody of Mr Hammond , the Sheriff , and another white person who assisted him in the execution of his duty .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 52]: As he arrived at the door of the prison , he watched his opportunity , stabbed the person who was assisting the Sheriff , and , then passing his knife across the throat of Mr Hammond , the carotid artery was divided , and the latter fell dead upon the spot .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 37]: Now , here was a wretch who , in one day , had three times attempted murder , and had been successful in the instance of Mr Hammond , the sheriff , a person universally esteemed .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 112]: Moreover , when it is considered that the culprit was of a race who are looked upon as inferior ; that this successful attempt on the part of a black man was considered most dangerous as a precedent to the negro population ; that , owing to the unwillingness to take away life in America , he might probably have escaped justice ; and that this occurred just at the moment when the abolitionists were creating such mischief and irritation : -- although it must be lamented that they should have so disgraced themselves , the summary and cruel punishment which was awarded by an incensed populace is not very surprising .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 51]: Miss Martineau has , however , thought proper to pass over the peculiar atrocity of the individual who was thus sacrificed : to read her account of the transaction , it would appear as if he were an unoffending party , sacrificed on account of his _ colour _ alone .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 19]: Another remarkable instance was the execution of five gamblers at the town of Vicksburgh , on the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 45]: It may appear strange that people should be lynched for the mere vice of gambling : but this will be better understood when , in my second portion of this work , I enter into a general view of society in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 56]: At present it will be sufficient to say , that as towns rise in the South and West , they gradually become peopled with a better class ; and that , as soon as this better class is sufficiently strong to accomplish their ends , a purification takes place much to the advantage of society .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 14]: I hardly need observe ; that these better classes come from the Eastward .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 18]: New Orleans , Natchez , and Vicksburgh are evidences of the truth of observations I have made .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 45]: In the present instance , it was resolved by the people of Vicksburgh that they would no longer permit their city to be the resort of a set of unprincipled characters , and that all gamblers by profession should be compelled to quit it .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 65]: But , as I have the American account of what occurred , I think it will be better to give it in detail , the rather as I was informed by a gentleman residing there that it is perfectly correct : -- Our city has for some days past been the theatre of the most novel and startling scenes that we have ever witnessed .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 63]: While we regret that the necessary for such scenes should have existed , we are proud of the public spirit and indignation against offenders displayed by the citizens , and congratulate them on having at length banished a class of individuals , whose shameless vices and daring outrages have long poisoned the springs of morality , and interrupted the relations of society .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 61]: For years past , professional gamblers , destitute of all sense of moral obligation -- unconnected with society by any of its ordinary ties , and intent only on the gratification of their avarice -- have made Vicksburgh their place of rendezvous -- and , in the very bosom of our society , boldly plotted their vile and lawless machinations .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 39]: Here , as everywhere else , the laws of the country were found wholly ineffectual for the punishment of these individuals ; and , emboldened by impunity , their numbers and their crimes have daily continued to multiply .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 9]: Every species of transgression followed in their train .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 41]: They supported a large number of tippling-houses , to which they would decoy the youthful and unsuspecting , and , after stripping them of their possessions , send them forth into the world the ready and desperate instrument of vice .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 24]: Our streets were ever resounding with the echoes of their drunken and obscene mirth , and no citizen was secure from their villainy .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 26]: Frequently , in armed bodies , they have disturbed the good order of public assemblages , insulted our citizens , and defied our civil authorities .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 56]: Thus had they continued to grow bolder in their wickedness , and more formidable in their numbers , until Saturday , the 4th of July -LRB- inst -RRB- , when our citizens had assembled together , with the corps of Vicksburg volunteers , at a barbecue , to celebrate the day by the usual festivities .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 56]: After dinner , and during the delivery of the toasts , one of the officers attempted to enforce order and silence at the table , when one of these gamblers , whose name is Cabler , who had impudently thrust himself into the company , insulted the officer , and struck one of the citizens .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 23]: Indignation immediately rose high , and it was only by the interference of the commandant that he was saved from instant punishment .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 14]: He was , however , permitted to retire , and the company dispersed .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 53]: The military corps proceeded to the public square of the city , and were there engaged in their exercises , when information was received that Cabler was coming up , armed , and resolved to kill one of the volunteers , who had been most active in expelling him from the table .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 16]: Knowing his desperate character , two of the corps instantly stepped forward and arrested him .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 28]: A loaded pistol and a large knife and dagger were found upon his person , all of which he had procured since he separated from the company .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 57]: To liberate him would have been to devote several of the most respectable members of the company to his vengeance , and to proceed against him at law , would have been mere mockery , inasmuch as , not having had the opportunity of consummating his design , no adequate punishment could be inflicted on him .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 39]: Consequently , it was determined to take him into the woods and _ Lynch _ him , which is a mode of punishment provided for such as become obnoxious in a manner which the law can not reach .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 40]: He was immediately carried out under a guard , attended by a crowd of respectable citizens , tied to a tree , punished with stripes , tarred and feathered , and ordered to leave the city in forty-eight hours .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 40]: In the meantime , one of his comrades , the Lucifer of his gang , had been endeavouring to rally and arm his confederates for the purpose of rescuing him -- which , however , he failed to accomplish .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 90]: `` Having thus aggravated the whole band of these desperadoes , and feeling no security against their vengeance , the citizens met at night in the Court-house , in a large number , and there passed the following resolutions : -- '' _ Resolved _ , That a notice be given to all professional gamblers , that the citizens of Vicksburg are _ resolved _ to exclude them from this place and its vicinity ; and that twenty-four hours ' notice be given them to leave the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 24]: _ Resolved _ , That all persons permitting faro-dealing in their houses , he also notified that they will be prosecuted therefore . ''
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 33]: _ Resolved _ , That one hundred copies of the foregoing resolutions be printed and stuck up at the corners of the streets -- and that this publication be deemed a notice .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 21]: `` On Sunday morning , one of these notices was posted at the corners of each square of the city .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 31]: During that day -LRB- the 5th -RRB- a majority of the gang , terrified by the threats of the citizens , dispersed in different directions , without making any opposition .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 24]: It was sincerely hoped that the remainder would follow their example and thus prevent a bloody termination of the strife which had commenced .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 46]: On the morning of the 6th , the military corps , followed by a file of several hundred citizens , marched to each suspected house , and sending in an examining committee , dragged out every faro-table and other gambling apparatus that could be found .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 39]: At length they approached a house which occupied by one of the most profligate of the gang , whose name was North , and in which it was understood that a garrison of armed men had been stationed .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 28]: All hoped that these wretches would be intimidated by the superior numbers of their assailants , and surrender themselves at discretion rather than attempt a desperate defence .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 40]: The house being surrounded , the back door was burst open , when four or five shots were fired from the interior , one of which instantly killed Dr Hugh S Bodley , a citizen universally beloved and respected .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 31]: The interior was so dark that the villains could not be seen ; but several of the citizens , guided by the flash of their guns , returned their fire .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 53]: A yell from one of the party announced that one of the shots had been effectual , and by this time a crowd of citizens , their indignation overcoming all other feelings , burst open every door of the building , and dragged into the light those who had not been wounded .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 46]: `` North the ringleader , who had contrived this desperate plot , could not be found in the building , but was apprehended by a citizen , while attempting , in company with another , to make his escape at a place not fir distant .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 20]: Himself , with the rest of the prisoners , was then conducted _ in silence _ to the scaffold .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 38]: One of them , not having been in the building before it was attacked , nor appearing to be concerned with the rest , except that he was the brother of one of them , was liberated .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 33]: The remaining number of five , among whom was the individual who had been shut , but who still lived , were _ immediately executed _ in presence of the assembled multitude .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 16]: All sympathy for the wretches was completely merged in detestation and horror of their crime .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 21]: The whole procession then returned to the city , collected all the faro-tables into a pile , and burnt them .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 52]: This being done , a troop of horsemen set out for a neighbouring house ; the residence of J Hord the individual who had attempted to organise a force on the first day of the disturbance for the rescue of Cabler , who had since been threatening to fire the city .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 32]: He had , however , made his escape on that day , and the next morning crossed the Big Black at Baldwin 's Ferry , in a state of indescribable consternation .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 38]: We lament his escape , as his whole course of life for the last three years has exhibited the most shameless profligacy , and been a series of continual transgressions against the laws of God and man .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 25]: `` The names of the individuals who perished were as follow : -- North , Hullams , Dutch Bill , Smith , and Mccall .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 19]: `` Their bodies were cut down on the morning after the execution , and buried in a ditch .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 32]: `` It is not expected that this act will pass without censure from those who had not an opportunity of knowing and feeling the dire necessity out of which it originated .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 38]: The laws , however severe in their provision , have never been sufficient to correct a vice which must be established by positive proof , and can not , like others , be shown from circumstantial testimony .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 54]: It is practised , too , by individuals whose whole study is to violate the law in such a manner as to evade its punishment , and who never are in want of secret confederates to swear them out of their difficulties , whose oaths can not be impeached for any specific cause .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 41]: We had borne with their enormities until to suffer them any longer would not only have proved us to be destitute of every manly sentiment , but would also have implicated us in the guilt of necessaries to their crimes .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 28]: Society may be compared to the elements , which , although ` order is their first law , ' can sometimes be purified only by a storm .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 92]: Whatever , therefore , sickly sensibility or mawkish philanthropy may say against the course pursued by us , we hope that our citizens will not relax the code of punishment which they have enacted against this infamous and baleful class of society ; and we invite Natchez , Jackson , Columbus , Warrenton , and all our sister towns throughout the State , in the name of our insulted laws , of offended virtue , and of slaughtered innocence , to aid us in exterminating this deep-rooted vice from our land .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 26]: The revolution has been conducted here by the most respectable citizens , heads of families , members of all classes , professions , and pursuits .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 23]: None have been heard to utter a syllable of censure against either the act or the manner in which it was performed .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 36]: `` An Anti-Gambling Society has been formed , the members of which have pledged their lives , fortunes , and sacred honours for the suppression of gambling , and the punishment and expulsion of gamblers .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 38]: `` Startling as the above may seem to foreigners , it will ever reflect honour on the insulted citizens of Vicksburg , among those who best know how to appreciate the motives by which they were actuated .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 34]: Their city now stands redeemed and ventilated from all the vices and influence of gambling and assignation houses ; two of the greatest curses that ever corrupted the morals of any community . ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 36]: That the society in the towns on the banks of the Mississippi can only , like the atmosphere , `` be purified by storm , '' is , I am afraid , but too true .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 32]: I have now entered fully , and I trust impartially , into the rise and progress of Lynch Law , and I must leave my readers to form their own conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 73]: That it has occasionally been beneficial , in the peculiar state of the communities in which it has been practised , must be admitted ; but it is equally certain that it is in itself indefensible , and that but too often , not only the punishment is much too severe for the offence , but what is still more to be deprecated , the innocent do occasionally suffer with the guilty .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 19]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ `` A similar case is to be found at the present day , west of the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 41]: Upon lands belonging to the United States , not yet surveyed or offered for sale , are numerous bodies of people who have occupied them , with the intention of purchasing them when they shall be brought into the market .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 56]: These persons are mailed _ squatters _ , and it is not to be supposed that they consist of the _ elite _ of the emigrants to the West ; yet we are informed that they have organised a government for themselves , and regularly elect magistrates to attend to the execution of the laws .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 15]: They appears in this respect , to be worthy descendants of the pilgrims . ''
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 7]: -- _ Carey on Wealth _ .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 7]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER FORTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 4]: REMARKS -- CLIMATE .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 113]: I wish the remarks in this chapter to receive peculiar attention , as in commenting upon the character of the Americans , it is but justice to them to point out that many of what may be considered their errors , arise from _ circumstances _ over which they have no control ; and one which has no small weight in this scale is the peculiar climate of the country ; for various as is the climate , in such an extensive region , certain it is , that in one point , that of _ excitement _ , it has , in every portion of it , a very pernicious effect .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 18]: When I first arrived at New York , the effect of the climate upon me was immediate .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 13]: On the 5th of May , the heat and closeness were oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 27]: There was a sultriness in the air , even at that early period of the year , which to me seemed equal to that of Madras .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 34]: Almost every day there were , instead of our mild refreshing showers , sharp storms of thunder and lightning ; but the air did not appear to me to be cooled by them .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 49]: And yet , strange to say , there were no incipient signs of vegetation : the trees waved their bare arms , and while I was throwing off every garment which I well could , the females were walking up and down Broadway wrapped up in warm shawls .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 45]: It appeared as if it required twice the heat we have in our own country , either to create a free circulation in the blood of the people , or to stimulate nature to rouse after the torpor of a protracted and severe winter .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 58]: In a week from the period I have mentioned , the trees were in full foliage , the _ belles _ of Broadway walking about in summer dresses and thin satin shoes ; the men calling for ice , and rejoicing in the beauty of the weather , the heat of which to me was most oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 44]: In one respect there appears to be very little difference throughout all the States of the Union ; which is , in the extreme heat of the summer months , and the rapid changes of temperature which take place in the twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 30]: When I was on Lake Superior the thermometer stood between 90 degrees and 100 degrees during the day , and at night was nearly down to the freezing point .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 59]: When at St Peter 's , which is nearly as far north , and farther west , the thermometer stood generally at 100 degrees to 106 degrees during the day , and I found it to be the case in all the northern States when the winter is most severe , as well as in the more southern .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 50]: When on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers , where the heat was most insufferable during the day , our navigation was almost every night suspended by the thick dank fogs , which covered not only the waters but the inland country , and which must be anything but healthy .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 47]: In fact , in every portion of the States which I visited , and in those portions also which I did not visit , the extreme heat and rapid changes in the weather were -LRB- according to the information received front other persons -RRB- the same .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 7]: But I must proceed to particulars .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 52]: I consider the climate on the sea coasts of the eastern States , from Maine to Baltimore , as the most unhealthy of all parts of America ; as , added to the sudden changes , they have cold and damp easterly winds , which occasion a great deal of consumption .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 27]: The inhabitants , more especially the women , shew this in their appearance , and it is by the inhabitants that the climate must be tested .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 34]: The women are very delicate , and very pretty ; but they remind you of roses which have budded fairly , but which a check in the season has not permitted to blow .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 20]: Up to sixteen or seventeen , they promise perfection ; at that age their advance appears to be checked .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 48]: Mr Sanderson , in a very clever and amusing work , which I recommend to every one , called `` Sketches of Paris , '' says : `` Our climate is noted for three eminent qualities -- extreme heat and cold , and extreme suddenness of change .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 56]: If a lady has bad teeth , or a bad complexion , she lays them conveniently to the climate ; if her beauty , like a tender flower , fades before noon , it is the climate ; if she has a bad temper , or a snub nose ; still it is the climate .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 27]: But our climate is active and intellectual , especially in winter , and in all seasons more pure and transparent than the inking skies of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 12]: It sustains the infancy of beauty -- why not its maturity ?
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 16]: It spares the bud -- why not the opened blossom , or the ripened fruit ?
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 13]: Our negroes are perfect in their teeth -- why not the whites ?
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 30]: The chief preservation of beauty in any country is health , and there is no place in which this great interest is so little attended to as in America .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 30]: To be sensible of this , you must visit Europe -- you must see the deep bosomed maids of England upon the Place Vendome and the Rue Castiglione . ''
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 22]: I have quoted this passage , because I think Mr Sanderson is not just in these slurs upon his fair countrywomen .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 27]: I acknowledge that a bad temper does not directly proceed from climate , although sickness and suffering , occasioned by climate , may directly produce it .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 22]: As for the snub nose , I agree with him , that climate has not so much to do with that .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 33]: Mr Sanderson is right in saying , that the chief preservative of beauty is health ; but may I ask him , upon what does health depend but upon _ exercise _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 40]: and if so , how many days are there in the American summer in which the heat will admit of exercise , or in the American winter in which it is possible for women to _ walk _ out ?
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 27]: for carriage driving is not exercise , and if it were , from the changes in the weather in America , it will always be dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 38]: The fact is , that the climate will not admit of the exercise necessary for health , unless by running great risks , and very often contracting cold and chills , which end in consumption and death .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 19]: To accuse his countrywomen of natural indolence , is unfair ; it is an indolence forced upon them .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 31]: As for the complexions of the females , I consider they are much injured by the universal use of close stoves , so necessary in the extremity of the winters .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 22]: Mr S 's implication , that because negroes have perfect teeth , therefore so should the whites , is another error .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 48]: The negroes were born for , and in , a torrid clime , and there is some difference between their strong ivory masticators and the transparent pearly teeth which so rapidly decay in the eastern states , from no other cause than the variability of the climate .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 16]: Besides , do the teeth of the women in the western states decay so fast ?
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 64]: Take a healthy situation , with an intermediate climate , such as Cincinnati , and you will there find not only good teeth , but as deep-bosomed maids as you will in England ; so you will in Virginia , Kentucky , Missouri , and Wisconsin , which , with a portion of Ohio , are the most healthy states in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 97]: There is another proof , and a positive one , that the women are affected by the _ climate _ and not through any fault of their own , which is , that if you transplant a delicate American girl to England , she will in a year or two become so robust and healthy as not to be recognised upon her return home ; showing that the even temperature of our damp climate is from the capability of constant exercise , more conducive to health , than the sunny , yet variable atmosphere of America .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 28]: The Americans are fond of their climate , and consider it , as they do every thing in America , as the very best in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 15]: They are , as I have said before , most happy in their delusions .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 90]: But if the climate be not a healthy one , it is certainly a beautiful climate to the eye ; the sky is so clear , the air so dry , the tints of the foliage so inexpressibly beautiful in the autumn and early winter months : and at night , the stars are so brilliant , hundreds being visible with the naked eye which are not to be seen by us , that I am not surprised at the Americans praising the _ beauty _ of their climate .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 36]: The sun is terrific in his heat , it is true , but still one can not help feeling the want of it , when in England , he will disdain to shine for weeks .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 25]: Since my return to this country , the English reader can hardly form an idea of how much I have longed for the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 84]: After having sojourned for nearly two years in America , the sight of it has to me almost amounted to a necessity , and I am not therefore at all astonished at an American finding fault with the climate of England ; nevertheless , our climate , although unprepossessing to the eye , and depressive to the animal spirits , is much more healthy than the exciting and changeable atmosphere , although beautiful in appearance , which they breathe in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 24]: One of the first points to which I directed my attention on my arrival in America , was to the diseases most prevalent .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 58]: In the eastern States , as may be supposed , they have a great deal of consumption ; in the western , the complaint is hardly known : but the general nature of the American diseases are _ neuralgic _ , or those which affect the nerves , and which are common to almost all the Union .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 18]: Ophthalmia , particularly the disease of the ophthalmic nerve , is very common in the eastern States .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 26]: The medical men told me that there were annually more diseases of the eye in New York city alone , than perhaps all over Europe .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 48]: How far this may be correct I can not say ; but this I can assert , that I never had any complaint in my eyes until I arrived in America , and during a stay of eighteen months , I was three times very severely afflicted .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 15]: The oculist who attended me asserted that he had _ seven hundred _ patients .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 44]: The _ tic doloureux _ is another common complaint throughout America , -- indeed so common is it , that I should say that one out of ten suffers from it , more or less ; the majority , however , are women .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 21]: I saw more cases of _ delirium tremens _ in America , than I ever _ heard _ of before .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 13]: In fact , the climate is one of _ extreme excitement _ .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 54]: I had not been a week in the country before I discovered how impossible it was for a foreigner to drink as much wine or spirits as he could in England , and I believe that thousands of emigrants have been carried off by making no alteration in their habits upon their arrival .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 4]: See Note 1 .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 52]: The winters in Wisconsin , Ioway , Missouri , and Upper Canada , are dry and healthy , enabling the inhabitants to take any quantity of exercise , and I found that the people looked forward to their winters with pleasure , longing for the heat of the summer to abate .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 57]: Michigan , Indiana , Illinois , and a portion of Ohio , are very unhealthy in the autumns from the want of drainage ; the bilious congestive fever , ague , and dysentery , carrying off large numbers , Virginia , Kentucky , North Carolina , and the eastern portions of Tennessee , are comparatively healthy .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 71]: South Carolina , and all the other southern States , are , as it is well known , visited by the yellow fever , and the people migrate every fall to the northward , not only to avoid the contagion , but to renovate their general health , which suffers from the continual demand upon their energies , the western and southern country being even more exciting than the east .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 41]: There is a fiery disposition in the Southerners which is very remarkable ; they are much more easily excited than even the Spaniard or Italian , and their feelings are more violent and unrestrainable , as I shall hereafter show .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 29]: That this is the effect of climate I shall now attempt to prove by one or two circumstances , out of the many which fell under my observation .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 27]: It is impossible to imagine a greater difference in character than exists between the hot-blooded Southerner , and the cold calculating Yankee of the eastern States .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 44]: I have already said that there is a continual stream of emigration from the eastern States to the southward and westward the farmers of the eastern States leaving their comparatively barren lands to settle down upon the more grateful soils of the interior .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 29]: Now , it is a singular , yet a well known fact , that in a very few years the character of the Eastern farmer is completely changed .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 76]: He arrives there a hard-working , careful , and sober man ; for the first two or three years his ground is well tilled , and his crops are abundant ; but by degrees he becomes a different character : he neglects his farm , so that from rich soil he obtains no better crops than he formerly did upon his poor land in Massachusetts ; he becomes indolent , reckless , and often intemperate .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 32]: Before he has settled five years in the Western country , the climate has changed him into a Western man , with all the peculiar virtues and vices of the country .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 33]: A Boston friend of mine told me that he was once on board of a steamboat on the Mississippi , and found that an old schoolfellow was first mate of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 32]: They ran upon a snag , and were obliged to lay the vessel on shore until they could put the cargo on board of another steamboat , and repair the damage .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 46]: The passengers , as usual on such occasions , instead of grumbling at what could not be helped , as people do in England , made themselves merry ; and because they could not proceed on their voyage they very wisely resolved to drink champagne .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 23]: They did so : a further supply being required , this first mate was sent down into the hold to procure it .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 43]: My Boston friend happened to be at the hatchway when he went down with a flaring candle in his hand , and he observed the mate creep over several small barrels until he found the champagne cases , and ordered them up .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 8]: `` What is in those barrels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 11]: inquired he of the mate when he came up again .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 8]: `` Oh , _ gunpowder _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 4]: replied the mate .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 5]: `` Good Heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 15]: exclaimed the Bostonian , `` is it possible that you could be so careless ?
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 18]: why I should have thought better of you ; you used to be a prudent man . ''
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 57]: `` Yes , and so I was , until I came into this part of the country , '' replied the mate , `` but somehow or another , I do n't care for things now , which , when I was in my own State , would have frightened me out of my wits . ''
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 17]: Here was a good proof of the Southern recklessness having been imbibed by a cautious Yankee .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 69]: I have adduced the above instances , because I consider that the excitement so general throughout the Union , and forming so remarkable a feature in the American character , is occasioned much more by climate than by any other cause : that the peculiarity of their institutions affords constant aliment for this excitement to feed upon is true , and it is therefore seldom allowed to repose .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 33]: I think , moreover , that their climate is the occasion of two bad habits to which the Americans are prone , namely , the use of tobacco and of spirituous liquors .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 31]: An Englishman could not drink as the Americans do ; it would destroy him here in a very short time , by the irritation it would produce upon his nerves .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 34]: But the effect of tobacco is narcotic and anti-nervous ; it allays that irritation , and enables the American to indulge in stimulating habits without their being attended with such immediate ill consequences .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 44]: To the rapid changes of the climate , and to the extreme heat , must be also to a great degree ascribed the excessive use of spirituous liquors ; the system being depressed by the sudden changes demanding stimulus to equalise the pulse .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 13]: The extraordinary heat during the summer is also another cause of it .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 49]: The Rev Mr Reid says , in his Tour through the States , `` the disposition to drink now became intense ; we had only to consider how we might safely gratify it ; the thermometer rose to low , and the heat and perspiration were intolerable . ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 24]: Now , if a Christian divine acknowledged this feeling , it is not to be supposed but that others must be equally affected .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 79]: To drink pure water during this extreme heat is very dangerous : it must be qualified with some wine or spirit ; and thus is an American led into a habit of drinking , from which it is not very easy , indeed hardly possible , for him to abstain , except during the winter , and the winters in America are too cold for a man to leave off _ any _ of his _ habits _ .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 65]: Let it not be supposed that I wish to excuse intemperance : far from it ; but I wish to be just in my remarks upon the Americans , and show , that if they are intemperate -LRB- which they certainly are -RRB- , there is more excuse for them than there is for other nations , from their temptation arising out of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 17]: There is but one other point to be considered in examining into the climate of America .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 36]: It will be admitted that the American stock is the very best in the world , being originally English , with a favourable admixture of German , Irish , French , and other northern countries .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 23]: It moreover has the great advantage of a continual importation of the same varieties of stock to cross and improve the breed .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 17]: The question then is , have the American race improved or degenerated since the first settlement ?
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 12]: If they have degenerated , the climate can not be healthy .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 34]: I was very particular in examining into this point , and I have no hesitation in saying , that the American people are not equal in strength or in form to the English .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 67]: I may displease the Americans by this assertion , and they may bring forward their backwoodsmen and their Kentuckians , who live at the spurs of the Alleghany Mountains , as evidence to the contrary ; but although they are powerful and tall men they are not well made , nor so well made as the Virginians , who are the finest race in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 58]: There is one peculiar defect in the American figure common to both sexes , which is , _ narrowness of the shoulders _ , and it is a very great defect ; there seems to be a check to the expansion of the chest in their climate , the physiological causes of which I leave to others .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 23]: On the whole , they certainly are a taller race than the natives of Europe , but not with proportionate muscular strength .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 47]: Their climate , therefore , I unhesitatingly pronounce to be bad , being injurious to them in the two important points , of healthy vigour in the body , and healthy action of the mind ; enervating the one , and tending to demoralise the other .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 4]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note 1 .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 53]: Vermont , New Hampshire , the interior portion of the State of New York , and all the portions of the other States which abut on the great lakes , are healthy , owing to the dryness of the atmosphere being softened down by the proximity of such large bodies of water .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 7]: VOLUME THREE , CHAPTER FORTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 4]: REMARKS -- EDUCATION .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 42]: Mr Carey , in his statistical work , falls into the great error of most American writers -- that of lauding his own country and countrymen , and inducing them to believe that they are superior to all nations under heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 43]: This is very injudicious , and highly injurious to the national character : it upholds that self-conceit to which the Americans are already so prone , and checks that improvement so necessary to place them on a level with the English nation .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 50]: The Americans have gained more by their faults having been pointed out by travellers than they will choose to allow ; and , from his moral courage in fearlessly pointing out the truth , the best friend to America , among their own countrymen , has been Dr Charming .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 46]: I certainly was under the impression , previous to my visit to the United States , that education was much more universal there than in England ; but every step I took , and every mile I travelled , lowered my estimate on that point .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 67]: To substantiate my opinion by statistical tables would be difficult ; as , after much diligent search , I find that I can only obtain a correct return of a portion of our own establishments ; but , even were I able to obtain a general return , it would not avail me much , as Mr Carey has no general return to oppose to it .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 32]: He gives us , as useful , Massachusetts and one or two other States , but no more ; and , as I have before observed , Massachusetts is not America .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 28]: His remarks and quotations from English authors are not fair ; they are loose and partial observations , made by those who have a case to substantiate .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 29]: Not that I blame Mr Carey for making use of those authorities , such as they are ; but I wish to show that they have misled him .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 44]: I must first observe that Mr Carey 's estimate of education in England is much lower than it ought to be ; and I may afterwards prove that his estimate of education in the United States is equally erroneous on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 21]: To estimate the amount of education in England by the number of _ national schools _ must ever be wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 63]: In America , by so doing , a fair approximation may be arrived at , as the education of all classes is chiefly confined to them ; but in England the case is different ; not only the rich and those in the middling classes of life , but a large proportion of the poor , sending their children to private schools .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 22]: Could I have obtained a return of the private seminaries in the United Kingdom , it would have astonished Mr Carey .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 50]: The small parish of Kensington and its vicinity has only two national schools , but it contains 292 -LRB- I believe this estimate is below the mark -RRB- private establishments for education ; and I might produce fifty others , in which the proportion would be almost as remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 20]: I have said that a large portion of the poorer classes in England send their children to private teachers .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 36]: This arises from a feeling of pride ; they prefer paying for the tuition of their children rather than having their children educated by the _ parish _ , as they term the national schools .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 42]: The consequence is , that in every town , or village , or hamlet , you will find that there are `` dame schools , '' as they are termed , at which about one half of the children are educated .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 29]: The subject of national education has not been warmly taken up in England until within these last twenty-five years , and has made great progress during that period .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 13]: The Church of England Society for National Education was established in 1813 .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 15]: Two years after its formation there were only 230 schools , containing 40,484 children .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 28]: By the Twenty-seventh Report of this Society , ending the year 1838 , these schools had increased to 17,341 , and the number of scholars to 1,003,087 .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 40]: But this , it must be recollected , is but a small proportion of the public education in England ; the Dissenters having been equally diligent , and their schools being quite as numerous in proportion to their numbers .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 69]: We have , moreover , the workhouse schools , and the dame schools before mentioned , for the poorer classes ; and for the rich and middling classes , establishments for private tuition , which , could the returns of them and of the scholars be made , would , I am convinced , amount to more than five times the number of the national and public establishments .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 52]: But as Mr Carey does not bring forward his statistical proof ; and I can not produce mine , all that I can do is to venture my opinion from what I learnt and saw during my sojourn in the United States , or have obtained from American and other authorities .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 95]: The State of Massachusetts is a _ school _ ; it may be said that all there are educated , Mr Reid states in his work : -- `` It was lately ascertained by returns from 131 towns in Massachusetts , that the number of scholars was 12,393 ; that the number of persons in the towns between the ages of fourteen and twenty-one who are unable to write was fifty-eight ; and in one town there were only three persons who could not read or write , and those three were dumb . ''
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 29]: I readily assent to this , and I consider Connecticut equal to Massachusetts ; but as you leave these two states , you find that education gradually diminishes .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 6]: -LSB- See Note 1 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 20]: New York is the next in rank , and thus the scale descends until you arrive at absolute ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 27]: I will now give what I consider as a fair and impartial tabular analysis of the degrees of education in the different states in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 15]: It may be cavilled at , but it will nevertheless be a fair approximation .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 50]: It must be remembered that it is not intended to imply that there are not a certain portion of well-educated people in those states put down in class 4 , as ignorant states , but they are included in the Northern states , where they principally receive their education .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 13]: _ Degrees of Education in the different States in the Union _ .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 27]: If I am correct , it appears then that we have : -- This census is an estimate of 1836 , sufficiently near for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 37]: It is supposed that the population of the united States has since increased about two millions , and of that increase the great majority is in the Western states , where the people are wholly uneducated .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 50]: Taking , therefore , the first three classes , in which there is education in various degrees , we find that they amount to 12,193,000 ; against which we may fairly put the 5,000,000 uneducated , adding to it , the 2,000,000 increased population , and 3,000,000 of slaves .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 19]: I believe the above to be a fair estimate , although nothing positive can be collected from it .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 24]: In making a comparison of the degree of education in the United States and in England , one point should not be overlooked .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 33]: In England , children may be sent to school , but they are taken away as soon as they are useful , and have little time to follow up their education afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 27]: Worked like machines , every hour is devoted to labour , and a large portion forget , from disuse , what they have learnt when young .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 33]: In America , they have the advantage not only of being educated , but of having plenty of time , if they choose , to profit by their education in after life .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 26]: The mass in America ought , therefore , to be better educated than the mass in England , where _ circumstances _ are against it .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 14]: I must now examine the nature of education given in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 45]: It is admitted as an axiom in the United States , that the only chance they have of upholding their present institutions is by the education of the mass ; that is to say , a people who would govern themselves must be enlightened .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 31]: Convinced of this necessity , every pains has been taken by the Federal and State governments to provide the necessary means of _ education _ -LSB- See Note 4 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 32]: This is granted ; but we now have to inquire into the nature of the education , and the advantages derived from such education as is received in the United States .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 9]: In the first place , what is education ?
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 10]: Is teaching a boy to read and write education ?
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 37]: If so , a large proportion of the American community may be said to be educated ; but , if you supply a man with a chest of tools , does he therefore become a carpenter !
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 25]: You certainly give him the means of working at the trade , but instead of learning it , he may only cut his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 22]: Reading and writing without the farther assistance necessary to guide people aright , is nothing more than a chest of tools .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 6]: Then , what is education ?
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 58]: I consider that education commences before a child can walk : the first principle of education , the most important , and without which all subsequent are but as leather and prunella , is the lesson of _ obedience _ -- of submitting to parental control -- '' _ Honour thy father and thy mother _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 23]: Now , any one who has been in the United States must have perceived that there is little or no parental control .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 26]: This has been remarked by most of the writers who have visited the country ; indeed to an Englishman it is a most remarkable feature .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 31]: How is it possible for a child to be brought up in the way that it should go , when he is not obedient to the will of his parents ?
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 61]: I have often fallen into a melancholy sort of musing after witnessing such remarkable specimens of uncontrolled will in children ; and as the father and mother both smiled at it , I have thought that they little knew what sorrow and vexation were probably in store for them , in consequence of their own injudicious treatment of their offspring .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 27]: Imagine a child of three years old in England behaving thus : -- `` Johnny , my dear , come here , '' says his mamma .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 9]: `` I wo n't , '' cries Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 19]: `` You must , my love , you are all wet , and you 'll catch cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 9]: `` I wo n't , '' replies Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 14]: `` Come , my sweet , and I 've something for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 6]: `` I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 12]: Mr -- , do , pray make Johnny come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 11]: `` Come in , Johnny , '' says the father .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 6]: `` I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 16]: `` I tell you , come in directly , sir -- do you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 14]: `` I wo n't , '' replies the urchin taking to his heels .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 22]: `` A sturdy republican , sir , '' says his father to me , smiling at the boy 's resolute disobedience .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 23]: Be it recollected that I give this as one instance of a thousand which I witnessed during my sojourn in the country .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 45]: It may be inquired , how is it that such is the case at present , when the obedience to parents was so rigorously inculcated by the puritan fathers , that by the blue laws , the punishment of disobedience was _ death _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 80]: Captain Hall ascribes it to the democracy , and the rights of equality therein acknowledged ; but I think , allowing the spirit of their institutions to have some effect in producing this evil , that the principal cause of it is the total neglect of the children by the father , and his absence in his professional pursuits , and the natural weakness of most mothers , when their children are left altogether to their care and guidance .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 32]: Mr Sanderson , in his Sketches of Paris , observes : -- `` The motherly virtues of our women , so eulogised by foreigners , is not entitled to unqualified praise .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 28]: There is no country in which maternal care is so assiduous ; but also there is none in which examples of injudicious tenderness are so frequent . ''
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 68]: This I believe to be true ; not that the American women are really more injudicious than those of England , but because they are not supported as they should be by the authority of the father , of whom the child should always entertain a certain portion of fear mixed with affection , to counterbalance the indulgence accorded by natural yearnings of a mother 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 33]: The self-will arising from this fundamental error manifests itself throughout the whole career of the American 's existence , and , consequently , it is a self-willed nation _ par excellence _ .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 33]: At the age of six or seven you will hear both boys and girls contradicting their fathers and mothers , and advancing their own opinions with a firmness which is very striking .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 13]: At fourteen or fifteen the boys will seldom remain longer at school .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 25]: At college , it is the same thing ; -LRB- note 6 -RRB- and they learn precisely what they please , and no more .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 28]: Corporal punishment is not permitted ; indeed , if we are to judge from an extract I took from an American paper , the case is reversed .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 34]: The following `` Rules '' are posted up in New Jersey school-house : -- `` No kissing girls in school-time ; no _ licking _ the _ master _ during holy days . ''
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 33]: At fifteen or sixteen , if not at college , the boy assumes the man ; he enters into business , as a clerk to some merchant , or in some store .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 25]: His father 's home is abandoned , except when it may suit his convenience , his salary being sufficient for most of his wants .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 17]: He frequents the bar , calls for gin cocktails , chews tobacco , and talks politics .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 32]: His theoretical education , whether he has profited much by it or not , is now superseded by a more practical one , in which he obtains a most rapid proficiency .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 24]: I have no hesitation in asserting that there is more practical knowledge among the Americans than among any other people under the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 5]: -LRB- note 7 -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 28]: It is singular that in America , everything , whether it be of good of evil , appears to assist the country in _ going a-head _ .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 32]: This very want of parental control , however it may affect the morals of the community , is certainly advantageous to America , as far as her rapid advancement is concerned .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 27]: Boys are working like men for years before they would be in England ; time is money , and they assist to bring in the harvest .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 15]: But does this independence on the part of the youth of America end here ?
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 29]: On the contrary , what at first was _ independence _ , assumes next the form of _ opposition _ , and eventually that of _ control _ .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 60]: The young men before they are qualified by age to claim their rights as citizens , have their societies , their book-clubs , their political meetings , their resolutions , all of which are promulgated in the newspapers ; and very often the young men 's societies are called upon by the newspapers to come forward with their opinions .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 6]: Here is _ opposition _ .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 28]: Mr Cooper says , on page 152 of his `` Democrat '' : -- `` The defects in American deportment are , notwithstanding , numerous and palpable .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 22]: Among the first may be ranked , _ insubordination in children _ , and a great want of respect for age .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 84]: The former vice may be ascribed to the business habits of the country , which leave so little time for parental instruction , and , perhaps , in some degree to the acts of political agents , who , with their own advantages in view , among the other expedients of their cunning , have resorted to the artifice of separating children from their natural advisers by calling meetings of the young to decide on the fortunes and policy of the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 37]: But what is more remarkable , is the fact that society has been usurped by the young people , and the married and old people have been , to a certain degree , excluded from it .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 51]: A young lady will give a ball , and ask none but young men and young women of her acquaintance ; not a _ chaperon _ is permitted to enter , and her father and mother are requested to stay upstairs , that they may not interfere with the amusement .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 24]: This is constantly the case in Philadelphia and Baltimore , and I have heard bitter complaints made by the married people concerning it .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 6]: Here is _ control _ .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 42]: Mr Sanderson , in his `` Sketches of Paris , '' observes : -- `` They who give a tone to society should have maturity of mind ; they should have refinement of taste , which is a quality of age .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 28]: As long as _ college beaux and boarding-school misses _ take the lead , it must be an insipid society , in whatever community it may exist .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 27]: Is it not villainous in your Quakerships of Philadelphia , to lay us , before we have lived half our time out , upon the shelf !
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 19]: Some of the native tribes , more merciful , eat the old folks out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 23]: However , retribution follows : in their turn they marry , and are ejected ; they have children , and are disobeyed .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 43]: The pangs which they have occasioned to their own parents are now suffered by them in return , through the conduct of their own children ; and thus it goes on , and will go on , until the system is changed .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 40]: All this is undeniable ; and thus it appears that the youth of America , being under no control , acquire just as much as they please , and no more , of what may be termed theoretical knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 31]: Thus is the first great error in American education , for how many boys are there who will learn without coercion , in proportion to the number who will not ?
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 22]: Certainly not one in ten , and , therefore it may be assumed that not one in ten is properly instructed .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 6]: -LSB- See note 6 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 53]: Now , that the education of the youth of America is much injured by the want of control on the part of the parents , is easily established by the fact that in those states where the parental control is the greatest , as in Massachusetts , the education is proportionably superior .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 30]: But this great error is followed by consequences even more lamentable : it is the first dissolving power of the kindred attraction , so manifest throughout all American society .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 97]: Beyond the period of infancy there is no endearment between the parents and children ; none of that sweet spirit of affection between brother and sisters ; none of those links which unite one family ; of that mutual confidence ; that rejoicing in each other 's success ; that refuge , when they are depressed or afflicted , in the bosoms of those who love us -- the sweetest portion of human existence , which supports us wider , and encourages us firmly to brave , the ills of life -- nothing of this exists .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 19]: In short , there is hardly such a thing in America as `` Home , sweet home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 29]: That there are exceptions to this , I grant but I speak of the great majority of cases , and the results upon the character of the nation .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 47]: Mr Cooper , speaking of the weakness of the family tie in America , says -- `` Let the reason be what it will , the effect is to cut us off from a large portion of the happiness that is dependent on the affections . ''
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 42]: The next error of American education is , that in their anxiety to instil into the minds of youth a proper and ardent love of their own institutions , feelings and sentiments are fostered which ought to be most carefully checked .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 46]: It matters little whether these feelings -LRB- in themselves vices -RRB- are directed against the institutions of other countries ; the vice once engendered remains , and _ hatred _ once implanted in the breast of youth , will not be confined in its action .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 72]: Neither will national conceit remain only _ national _ conceit , or _ vanity _ be confined to admiration of a form of government ; in the present mode of educating the youth of America , all sight is lost of humility , good-will , and the other Christian virtues , which are necessary to constitute a good man , whether he be an American , or of any other country .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 12]: Let us examine the manner in which a child is taught .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 40]: Democracy , equality , the vastness of his own country , the glorious independence , the superiority , of the Americans in all conflicts by sea or land , are impressed upon his mind before he can well read .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 35]: All their elementary books contain garbled and false accounts of naval and land engagements , in which every credit is given to the Americans , and equal vituperation and disgrace thrown upon their opponents .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 20]: Monarchy is derided , the equal rights of man declared -- all is invective , uncharitableness , and falsehood .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 41]: That I may not in this be supposed to have asserted too much , I will quote a reading-lesson from a child 's book , which I purchased in America as a curiosity , and is now in my possession .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 27]: It is called the `` Primary Reader for Young Children , '' and contains many stories besides this , relative to the history of the country .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 5]: `` LESSON '' 62 .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 9]: `` STORY ABOUT THE 4TH OF JULY '' .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 2]: 6 .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 13]: `` I must tell you what the people of New York did .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 20]: In a certain spot in that city there stood a large statue , or representation of King George III .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 6]: It was made of lead .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 23]: In one hand he held a sceptre , or kind of sword , and on his head he wore a crown . ''
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 2]: 7 .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 24]: `` When the news of the Declaration of Independence reached the city , a great multitude were seen running to the statue . ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 2]: 8 .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 16]: `` The cry was heard , ` Down with it -- down with it ! '
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 20]: and soon a rope was placed about its neck , and the leaden King George came tumbling down . ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 2]: 9 .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 25]: `` This might fairly be interpreted as a striking prediction of the downfall of the monarchical form of government in these United States . ''
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 2]: 10 .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 40]: `` If we look into history , we shall frequently find great events proceeding from as trifling causes as the fall of the _ leaden _ statue , which not unaptly represents the character of a despotic prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 2]: 11 .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 40]: `` I shall only add , that when the statue was fairly down , it was cut to pieces , and converted into musket-balls to kill the soldiers whom his majesty had sent over to fight the Americans . ''
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 8]: This is quite sufficient for a specimen .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 30]: I have no doubt that it will be argued by the Americans -- `` We are justified in bringing up our youth to _ love _ our institutions . ''
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 29]: I admit it ; but you bring them up to _ hate _ other people , before they have sufficient intellect to understand the merits of the case .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 43]: The author of '' _ A Voice from America _ , '' observes : -- `` Such , to a great extent is the unavoidable effect of that political education which is _ indispensable _ to all classes of a self-governed people .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 64]: They must be trained to it from their cradle ; it must go into all schools ; it must thoroughly leaven the national literature , it must be ` line upon line , and precept upon precept , ' here a little and there a little ; it must be sung , discoursed , and thought upon everywhere and by every body . ''
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 104]: And so it is ; and as if this scholastic drilling were not sufficient , every year brings round the 4th of July , on which is read in every portion of the states the act of independence , in itself sufficiently vituperative , but invariably followed-up by one speech -LRB- if not more -RRB- from some great personage of the village , hamlet , town , or city , as it may be , in which the more violent he is against monarchy and the English , and the more he flatters his own countrymen , the more is his speech applauded .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 58]: Every year is this drilled into the ears of the American boy , until he leaves school , when he takes a political part himself , connecting himself with young men 's society , where he spouts about tyrants , crowned heads , shades of his forefathers , blood flowing like water , independence , and glory .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 40]: The Rev Mr Reid very truly observes , of the reading of the Declaration of Independence : -- `` There is one thing , however , that may justly claim the calm consideration of a great and generous people .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 48]: Now that half a century has passed away , is it necessary to the pleasures of this day to revive feelings in the children which , if they were found in the parent , were to be excused only by the extremities to which they were pressed ?
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 18]: Is it generous , now that they have achieved the victory , not to forgive the adversary ?
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 31]: Is it manly , now that they have nothing to fear from Britain , to indulge in expressions of hate amid vindictiveness , which are the proper language of fear ?
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 12]: Would there be less patriotism , because there was more charity ?
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 11]: America should feel that her destinies are high and peculiar .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 23]: She should scorn the patriotism which cherishes the love of one 's own country , by the hatred of all others . ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 87]: I think , after what I have brought forward , the reader will agree with me , that the education of the youth in the United States is immoral , and the evidence that it is so , is in the demoralisation which has taken place in the United States since the era of the Declaration of Independence , and which fact is freely admitted by so many American writers : -- `` Aetas parentum pejor avis tulit Nos nequieres , mox daturos Progeniem vitiosiorem . ''
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 14]: _ Horace _ , _ book _ iii , _ ode _ 6 .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 55]: I shall by and by shew some of the effects produced by this injudicious system of education ; of which , if it is necessary to uphold their democratical institutions , I can only say , with Dr Franklin , that the Americans `` pay much too dear for their _ whistle _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 29]: It is , however , a fact , that education -LRB- such as I have shown it to be -RRB- is in the United States more equally diffused .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 49]: They have very few citizens of the States -LRB- except a portion of those in the West -RRB- who may be considered as `` hewers of wood and drawers of water , '' those duties being performed by the emigrant Irish and German , and the slave population .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 21]: The education of the higher classes is not by any means equal to that of the old countries or Europe .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 29]: You meet very rarely with a good classical scholar , or a very highly educated man , although some there certainly are , especially in the legal profession .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 39]: The Americans have not the leisure for such attainments : hereafter they may have ; but at present they do right to look principally to Europe for literature , as they can obtain it thence cheaper and better .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 42]: In every liberal profession you will find that the ordeal necessary to be gone through is not such as it is with us ; if it were , the difficulty of retaining the young men at college would be much increased .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 34]: To show that such is the case , I will now just give the difference of the acquirements demanded in the new and old country to qualify a young man as an MD. .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 69]: If the men in America enter so early into life that they have not time to obtain the acquirements supposed to be requisite with us , it is much the same thing with the females of the upper classes , who , from the precocious ripening by the climate and consequent early marriages , may be said to throw down their dolls that they may nurse their children .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 40]: The Americans are very justly proud of their women , and appear tacitly to acknowledge the want of theoretical education in their own sex , by the care and attention which they pay to the instruction of the other .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 43]: Their exertions are , however , to a certain degree , checked by the circumstance , that there is not sufficient time allowed previous to the marriage of the females to give that solidity to their knowledge which would ensure its permanency .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 12]: They attempt too much for so short a space of time .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 34]: Two or three years are usually the period during which the young women remain at the establishments , or colleges I may call them -LRB- for in reality they are female colleges . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 85]: In the prospectus of the Albany Female Academy , I find that the classes run through the following branches : -- French , book-keeping , ancient history , ecclesiastical history , history of literature , composition , political economy , American constitution , law , natural theology , mental philosophy , geometry , trigonometry , algebra , natural philosophy , astronomy , chemistry , botany , mineralogy , geology , natural history , and technology , besides drawing , penmanship , etcetera , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 64]: It is almost impossible for the mind to retain , for any length of time , such a variety of knowledge , forced into it before a female has arrived to the age of sixteen or seventeen , at which age , the study of these sciences , as is the case in England , should _ commence _ not _ finish _ .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 51]: I have already mentioned that the examinations which I attended were highly creditable both to preceptors and pupils ; but the duties of an American woman as I shall hereafter explain , soon find her other occupation , and the _ ologies _ are lost in the realities of life .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 19]: Diplomas are given at most of these establishments , on the young ladies completing their course of studies .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 28]: Indeed , it appears to be almost necessary that a young lady should produce this diploma as a certificate of being qualified to bring up young republicans .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 35]: I observed to an American gentlemen how youthful his wife appeared to be -- `` Yes , '' replied he , `` I married her a month after she had _ graduated _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 97]: The following are the terms of a diploma , which was given to a young lady at Cincinnati , and which she permitted me to copy : -- `` In testimony of the zeal and industry with which Miss M -- T -- has prosecuted the prescribed course of studies in the Cincinnati Female Institution , and the honourable proficiency which she has attained in penmanship , arithmetic , English grammar , rhetoric , belles-lettres , composition , ancient and modern geography , ancient and modern history , chemistry , natural philosophy , astronomy , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 2]: etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 11]: etcetera , of which she has given proofs by examination .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 37]: `` And also as a mark of her amiable deportment , intellectual acquirements , and our affectionate regard , we have granted her this letter -- the _ highest honour _ BESTOWED in this institution . ''

Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 19]: `` Given under our hands at Cincinnati , this 19th day of July , Anno Domini 1837 . ''
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 33]: The ambition of the Americans to be a-head of other nations in every thing , produces , however , injurious effects , so far as the education of the women is concerned .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 35]: The Americans will not '' _ leave well alone _ , '' they must `` gild refined gold , '' rather than not consider themselves in advance of other countries , particularly of England .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 50]: They _ alter _ our language , and think that they have _ improved _ upon it ; as in the same way they would raise the standard of morals higher than with us , and consequently fall much below us , appearances supplying the place of the reality .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 29]: In these endeavours they sink into a sickly sentimentality , and , as I have observed before , attempts at refinement in language , really excite improper ideas .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 44]: As a proof of the ridiculous excess to which this is occasionally carried , I shall insert an address which I observed in print ; had such a document appeared in the English newspapers , it would have been considered as a hoax .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 28]: `` Mrs Mandelle 's Address : -- `` To the young ladies of the Lancaster Female Academy , at an examination on the 3rd March , 1838 .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 33]: `` Affectionate Pupils : -- With many of you this is our final meeting in the relative position of teacher and pupil , and we must part perhaps to meet no more .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 22]: That this reflection _ filtrates from my mind to my heart _ with saddening influence , I need scarce assure you .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 34]: But _ Hope _ , in a voice sweet as ` the wild strains of the Eolian harp , ' whispers in dulcet accents , ` _ we may again meet _ . '
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 72]: In youth the impressions of sorrow are fleeting and evanescent as ` _ the vapery sail _ , ' that momentarily o'ershadows the _ luciferous orb of even _ , vanishes and leaves her disc untarnished in its lustre : so may it be with you -- may the gloom of this moment , like the elemental prototype , be but the precursor of reappearing radiance undimmed by the transitory shadow .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 75]: `` Happy and bright indeed has been this small portion of your time occupied , not only in the interesting pursuit of science , but in a reciprocation of attentions and sympathies , endeared by that holiest _ ligament _ of earthly sensibilities , _ religion _ , which so oft has united us in soul and sentiment , as the aspirations of our hearts simultaneously ascended to the mercy-seat of the great Jehovah !
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 24]: The remembrance of emotions like these are ineffaceable by care or sorrow , and only blotted out by the immutable hand of death .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 57]: These _ halcyon hours of budding existence _ are to memory as the _ oasis _ of the desert , where we may recline beneath the soothing _ influence _ of their umbrage , and quaff in _ the goblet of retrospection _ the lucid draught that refreshes for the moment , and is again forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 34]: Permit me to solicit , that the immaculate principles of _ virtue _ , I have so often and so carefully inculcated , may not be forgotten , but perseveringly cherished and practised .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 30]: May the divine dictates of reason _ murmur in harmonious cadence _ , bewitching as the fabled melody of the musical bells on the trees of the Mahomedan Paradise .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 23]: She dwells not alone beneath the glittering star , nor is always encircled by the diamond cestus and the jewel 'd tiara !

Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 25]: and the brilliancy _ emulged _ from the spangling gems , but make more hideous the dark , black spot enshrined in the effulgence .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 40]: The traces of her peaceful footsteps are found alike in the dilapidated hovel of the beggared peasant , and the velveted saloon of the coroneted noble ; who may then apportion her a home or assign her a clime ?
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 47]: In making my acknowledgments for the attentive interest with which you received my instructions ; and the respectful regard you manifested in appreciating my advice , it is not as a compliment to your vanity , but a debt due to your politeness and good sense .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 82]: Long , my beloved pupils , may my precepts and admonitions live in your hearts ; and hasten you , in the language of Addison , to commit yourself to the care of Omnipotence , and when the morning calls again to toil , cast all your cares upon him the author of your being , who has conducted you through one stage of existence , and who will always be present to guide and attend your progress through eternity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 79]: An advertisement of Mr Bonfil 's Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies , after enumerating the various branches of literature to be taught , winds up with the following paragraph : -- `` And finally , it will be constantly inculcated , that their education will be completed when they have the power to extend unaided , a spirit of investigation , searching and appreciating truth , _ without passing the bounds assigned to the human understanding _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 37]: I have now completed this volume , and although I omitted the major portion of my Diary , that I might not trespass too long upon the reader my task is still far from its termination .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 52]: The most important parts of it -- an examination into the American society and their government , and the conclusions to be drawn from the observations already made upon several subjects ; in short , the working out of the problem , as it were , is still to be executed .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 14]: I have not written one line of this work without deliberation and examination .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 21]: What I have already done has cost me much labour -- what I have to do will cost me more .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 59]: I must , therefore , claim for myself the indulgence of the public , and request that , in justice to the Americans , they will not decide until they have perused the second portion , with which I shall , as speedily as I can , wind up my observations upon the United States and their Institutions .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 4]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note 1 .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 29]: A church-yard with its mementos of mortality is sometimes a fair criterion by which to judge of the degree of the education of those who live near it .
