Parsing [sent. 1 len. 9]: ALEC FORBES OF HOWGLEN BY GEORGE MACDONALD LL.D .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 7]: NEW EDITION c. 1900 CHAPTER I .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 12]: The farm-yard was full of the light of a summer noontide .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 13]: Nothing can be so desolately dreary as full strong sunlight can be .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 34]: Not a living creature was to be seen in all the square inclosure , though cow-houses and stables formed the greater part of it , and one end was occupied by a dwelling-house .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 45]: Away through the gate at the other end , far off in fenced fields , might be seen the dark forms of cattle ; and on a road , at no great distance , a cart crawled along , drawn by one sleepy horse .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 25]: An occasional weary low came from some imprisoned cow -- or animal of the cow-kind ; but not even a cat crossed the yard .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 26]: The door of the barn was open , showing a polished floor , as empty , bright , and clean as that of a ball-room .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 19]: And through the opposite door shone the last year 's ricks of corn , golden in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 48]: Now , although a farm-yard is not , either in Scotland or elsewhere , the liveliest of places in ordinary , and still less about noon in summer , yet there was a peculiar cause rendering this one , at this moment , exceptionally deserted and dreary .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 79]: But there were , notwithstanding , a great many more people about the place than was usual , only they were all gathered together in the ben-end , or best room of the house -- a room of tolerable size , with a clean boarded floor , a mahogany table , black with age , and chairs of like material , whose wooden seats , and high , straight backs , were more suggestive of state than repose .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 29]: Every one of these chairs was occupied by a silent man , whose gaze was either fixed on the floor , or lost in the voids of space .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 15]: Each wore a black coat , and most of them were in black throughout .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 29]: Their hard , thick , brown hands -- hands evidently unused to idleness -- grasped their knees , or , folded in each other , rested upon them .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 43]: Some bottles and glasses , with a plate of biscuits , on a table in a corner , seemed to indicate that the meeting was not entirely for business purposes ; and yet there were no signs of any sort of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 12]: Nor was there a woman to be seen in the company .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 32]: Suddenly , at the open door , appeared a man whose shirt-sleeves showed very white against his other clothing which , like that of the rest , was of decent black .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 24]: He addressed the assembly thus : `` Gin ony o ' ye want to see the corp , noo 's yer time . ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 58]: To this offer no one responded ; and , with a slight air of discomfiture , for he was a busy man , and liked bustle , the carpenter turned on his heel , and re-ascended the narrow stairs to the upper room , where the corpse lay , waiting for its final dismission and courted oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 21]: `` I reckon they 've a ' seen him afore , '' he remarked , as he rejoined his companion .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 4]: `` Puir fallow !
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 8]: He 's unco -LRB- uncouthly -RRB- worn .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 15]: There 'll no be muckle o ' _ him _ to rise again . ''
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 21]: `` George , man , dinna jeest i ' the face o ' a corp , '' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 11]: `` Ye kenna whan yer ain turn may come . ''
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 11]: `` It 's no disrespeck to the deid , Thamas .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 6]: That ye ken weel eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 39]: I was only pityin ' the worn face o ' him , leukin up there atween the buirds , as gin he had gotten what he wanted sae lang , and was thankin ' heaven for that same .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 12]: I jist dinna like to pit the lid ower him . ''
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 3]: `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 2]: hoot !
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 8]: Lat the Lord luik efter his ain .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 13]: The lid o ' the coffin disna hide frae his een . ''
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 21]: The last speaker was a stout , broad-shouldered man , a stonemason by trade , powerful , and somewhat asthmatic .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 25]: He was regarded in the neighbourhood as a very religious man , but was more respected than liked , because his forte was rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 40]: It was from deference to him that the carpenter had assumed a mental position generating a poetic mood and utterance quite unusual with him , for he was a jolly , careless kind of fellow , well-meaning and good-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 21]: So together they lifted the last covering of the dead , laid it over him , and fastened it down .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 21]: And there was darkness about the dead ; but he knew it not , because he was full of light .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 17]: For this man was one who , all his life , had striven to be better .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 29]: Meantime , the clergyman having arrived , the usual religious ceremonial of a Scotch funeral -- the reading of the Word and prayer -- was going on below .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 28]: This was all that gave the burial any sacred solemnity ; for at the grave the Scotch terror of Popery forbids any observance of a religious character .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 13]: The voice of the reader was heard in the chamber of death .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 9]: `` The minister 's come , Thamas . ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 16]: `` Come or gang , '' said Thomas , `` it 's muckle the same .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 20]: The word itsel ' oot o ' his mou ' fa 's as deid as chaff upo ' clay .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 44]: Honest Jeames there 'll rise ance mair ; but never a word that man says , wi ' the croon o ' 's heid i ' the how o ' 's neck , 'll rise to beir witness o ' his ministrations . ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 5]: `` Hoot , Thamas !
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 34]: It 's no for the likes o ' me to flee i ' your face -- but jist say a fair word for the livin ' ower the deid , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 5]: `` Na , na .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 25]: It 's fair words maks foul wark ; and the wrath o ' the Almichty maun purge this toon or a ' be dune .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 49]: There 's a heap o ' graceless gaeins on i n't ; and that puir feckless body , the minister , never gies a pu ' at the bridle o ' salvation , to haud them aff o ' the scaur -LRB- cliff -RRB- o ' hell . ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 26]: The stone-mason generally spoke of the Almighty as if he were in a state of restrained indignation at the wrongs he endured from his children .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 17]: If Thomas was right in this , then certainly he himself was one of his offspring .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 14]: If he was wrong , then there was much well worth his unlearning .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 31]: The prayer was soon over , and the company again seated themselves , waiting till the coffin should be placed in the hearse , which now stood at the door .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 21]: `` We 'll jist draw the cork o ' anither boatle , '' whispered a sharp-faced man to his neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 30]: And rising , he opened two bottles , and filled the glasses the second time with wine , red and white , which he handed to the minister first .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 30]: `` Tak ' a drappy mair , sir , '' he whispered in a coaxing , old-wivish tone ; `` it 's a lang road to the kirkyard . ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 13]: But the minister declining , most of the others followed his example .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 22]: One after another they withdrew to the door , where the hearse was now laden with the harvest of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 16]: Falling in behind the body , they moved in an irregular procession from the yard .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 31]: Outside , they were joined by several more in gigs and on horseback ; and thus they crept , a curious train , away towards the resting-place of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 45]: It were a dreary rest , indeed , if that were their resting-place -- on the side of a low hill , without tree or shrub to beautify it , or even the presence of an old church to seem to sanctify the spot .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 24]: There was some long grass in it , though , clambering up as if it sought to bury the gravestones in their turn .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 8]: And that long grass was a blessing .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 19]: Better still , there was a sky overhead , in which men can not set up any gravestones .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 29]: But if any graveyard be the type of the rest expected by those left behind , it is no wonder they shrink from joining those that are away .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 22]: When the last man had disappeared , the women , like those of an eastern harem , began to come out .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 20]: The first that entered the deserted room was a hard-featured , reproachful-looking woman , the sister of the departed .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 22]: She instantly began to put the place in order , as if she expected her turn to come on the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 15]: In a few moments more a servant appeared , and began to assist her .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 22]: The girl had been crying , and the tears would still come , in spite of her efforts to repress them .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 35]: In the vain attempt to dry her eyes with the corner of her apron , she nearly dropped one of the chairs , which she was simultaneously dusting and restoring to its usual place .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 12]: Her mistress turned upon her with a kind of cold fierceness .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 23]: `` Is that hoo ye shaw yer regaird to the deid , by brackin ' the cheirs he left ahin ' him ?
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 18]: Lat sit , an ' gang an ' luik for that puir , doited thing , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 23]: Gin it had only been the Almichty 's will to hae ta'en her , an ' left him , honest man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 14]: `` Dinna daur to say a word again ' the bairn , mem .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 13]: The deid 'll hear ye , an ' no lie still . ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 4]: `` Supperstitious quean !
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 11]: Gang an ' do as I tell ye this minute .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 11]: What business hae ye to gang greetin aboot the hoose ?
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 11]: He was no drap 's bluid o ' yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 17]: To this the girl made no reply , but left the room in quest of Annie .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 31]: When she reached the door , she stood for a moment on the threshold , and , putting her hand over her eyes , shouted '' _ Annie _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 54]: But , apparently startled at the sound of her own voice where the unhearing dead had so lately passed , she let the end of the call die away in a quaver , and , without repeating it , set off to find the missing child by the use of her eyes alone .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 36]: First she went into the barn , and then through the barn into the stack-yard , and then round the ricks one after another , and then into the corn-loft ; but all without avail .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 34]: At length , as she was beginning to feel rather alarmed about the child , she arrived , in the progress of her search , at the door of one of the cow-houses .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 24]: The moment she looked round the corner into the stall next the door , she stood stock-still , with her mouth wide open .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 22]: This stall was occupied by a favourite cow -- brown , with large white spots , called therefore _ Brownie _ .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 53]: Her manger was full of fresh-cut grass ; and half-buried in this grass , at one end of the manger , with her back against the wall , sat Annie , holding one of the ears of the hornless Brownie with one hand and stroking the creature 's nose with the other .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 47]: She was a delicate child , about nine years old , with blue eyes , half full of tears , hair somewhere between dark and fair , gathered in a silk net , and a pale face , on which a faint moon-like smile was glimmering .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 12]: The old cow continued to hold her nose to be stroked .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 11]: `` Is na Broonie a fine coo , Betty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 13]: said the child , as the maid went on staring at her .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 4]: `` Puir Broonie !
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 15]: Naebody mindit me , an ' sae I cam to you , Broonie . ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 26]: And she laid her cheek , white , smooth , and thin , against the broad , flat , hairy forehead of the friendly cow .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 19]: Then turning again to Betty , she said -- `` Dinna tell auntie whaur I am , Betty .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 4]: Lat me be .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 9]: I 'm best here wi ' Broonie . ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 12]: Betty said never a word , but returned to her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 8]: `` Whaur 's the bairn , Betty ?
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 11]: At some mischeef or ither , I 'll wad . ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 3]: `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 8]: mem , the bairn 's weel eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 11]: Bairns maunna be followed like carr -LRB- calves -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 6]: `` Whaur is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 26]: `` I canna jist doonricht exackly tak upo ' me to say , '' answered Betty ; `` but I hae no fear aboot her .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 7]: She 's a wise bairn . ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 11]: `` Ye 're no the lassie 's keeper , Betty .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 9]: I see I maun seek her mysel ' .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 12]: Ye 're aidin ' an ' abettin ' as usual . ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 13]: So saying , Auntie Meg went out to look for her niece .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 21]: It was some time before the natural order of her search brought her at last to the _ byre _ .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 22]: By that time Annie was almost asleep in the grass , which the cow was gradually pulling away from under her .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 91]: Through the open door the child could see the sunlight lying heavy upon the hot stones that paved the yard ; but in here it was so dark-shadowy and cool , and the cow was such good , kindly company , and she was so safe hidden from auntie , as she thought -- for no one had ever found her there before , and she knew Betty would not tell -- that , as I say , she was nearly asleep with comfort , half-buried in Brownie 's dinner .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 15]: But she was roused all at once to a sense of exposure and insecurity .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 21]: She looked up , and at the same moment the hawk-nose of her aunt came round the _ door-cheek _ .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 39]: Auntie 's temper was none the better than usual that it had pleased the _ Almichty _ to take the brother whom she loved , and to leave behind the child whom she regarded as a painful responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 41]: And now with her small , fierce eyes , and her big , thin nose -- both red with suppressed crying -- she did not dawn upon the sense of Annie as an embodiment of the maternity of the universe .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 6]: `` Ye plaguesome brat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 60]: cried Auntie ; `` there has Betty been seekin ' ye , and I hae been seekin ' ye , far an ' near , i ' the verra rottan-holes ; an ' here ye are , on yer ain father 's buryin ' day , that comes but ance -- takin ' up wi ' a coo . ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 29]: But the causes of Annie 's preference of the society of Brownie to that of Auntie might have been tolerably clear to an onlooker , without word spoken .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 48]: For to Annie and her needs , notwithstanding the humble four-footedness of Brownie , there was in her large mild eyes , and her hairy , featureless face , all nose and no nose , more of the divine than in the human form of Auntie Meg .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 36]: And there was something of an indignation quite human in the way the cow tossed her bound head and neck towards the woman that darkened the door , as if warning her off her premises .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 39]: But without a word of reply , Annie rose , flung her arms around Brownie 's head , kissed the white star on her forehead , disengaged herself from the grass , and got out of the manger .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 22]: Auntie seized her hand with a rough action , but not ungentle grasp , and led her away to the house .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 11]: The stones felt very hot to her little bare feet .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 37]: By this time the funeral was approaching the churchyard at a more rapid pace ; for the pedestrians had dropped away one by one , on diverging roads , or had stopped and retraced their steps .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 19]: But as they drew near the place , the slow trot subsided into a slow walk once more .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 12]: To an English eye the whole mode would have appeared barbarous .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 63]: But if the carved and gilded skulls and cross-bones on the hearse were ill-conceived , at least there were no awful nodding plumes to make death hideous with yet more of cloudy darkness ; and one of the panels showed , in all the sunshine that golden rays could yield , the Resurrection of the Lord -- the victory over the grave .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 42]: And , again , when they stopped at the gate of the churchyard , they were the hands of friends and neighbours , and not those of cormorant undertakers and obscene mutes , that bore the dead man to his grave .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 94]: And , once more , if the only rite they observed , when the body had settled into its place of decay , was the silent uncovering of the head , as a last token of respect and farewell , it may be suggested that the Church of England herself , in all her beautiful service , has no prayer for the departed soul , which can not be beyond the need of prayer , as the longings that follow it into the region of the Unknown , are not beyond its comfort .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 12]: Before the grave was quite filled the company had nearly gone .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 39]: Thomas Crann , the stone-mason , and George Macwha , the _ wright _ , alone remained behind , for they had some charge over the arrangements , and were now taking a share in covering the grave .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 51]: At length the last sod was laid upon the mound , and stamped into its place , where soon the earth 's broken surface would heal , as society would flow together again , closing over the place that had known the departed , and would know him no more .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 37]: Then Thomas and George sat down , opposite to each other , on two neighbouring tombstones , and wiping their brows , gave each a sigh of relief , for the sun was hot and oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 3]: `` Hech !
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 10]: it 's a weary warl , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 45]: `` Ye hae no richt to say sae , George , '' answered Thomas , `` for ye hae never met it , an ' foughten wi ' ` t. Ye hae never draan the soord o ' the Lord and o ' Gideon .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 28]: Ye hae never broken the pitcher , to lat the lamp shine out , an ' I doubt ye hae smo ` red it by this time .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 17]: And sae , whan the bridegroom comes , ye 'll be ill-aff for a licht . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 5]: `` Hoot , man !
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 13]: dinna speak sic awfu ' things i ' the verra kirkyard . ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 17]: `` Better hear them i ' the kirkyard than at the closed door , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 58]: `` Weel , but , '' rejoined Macwha , anxious to turn the current of the conversation , which he found unpleasantly personal , `` jist tell me honestly , Thamas Crann , do ye believe , wi ' a ' yer heart an ' sowl , that the deid man -- Gude be wi ' him !
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 17]: -- '' `` No prayin ' for the deid i ' my hearin ' , George !
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 11]: As the tree falleth , so it shall lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 3]: `` Weel !
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 2]: weel !
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 6]: I didna mean onything . ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 6]: `` That I verily believe .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 5]: Ye seldom do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 122]: `` But I jist want to speir , '' resumed George , with some asperity , getting rather nettled at his companion 's persistent discourtesy , `` gin ye believe that Jeames Anderson here , honest man , aneath our feet , crumblin ' awa ' , as ye ken , and no ae spoke o ' his wheel to the fore , or lang , to tell what his cart was like -- do ye believe that his honest face will , ae day , pairt the mouls , an ' come up again , jist here , i ' the face o ' the light , the verra same as it vanished whan we pat the lid ower him ?
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 9]: Do ye believe that , Thamas Crann ? ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 9]: `` Na , na , George , man .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 10]: Ye ken little what ye 're busiest sayin ' .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 13]: It 'll be a glorifeed body that he 'll rise wi ' .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 11]: It 's sown in dishonour , and raised in glory .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 2]: Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 2]: hoot !
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 9]: ye _ are _ ignorant , man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 11]: Macwha got more nettled still at his tone of superiority .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 23]: `` Wad it be a glorifeed timmer-leg he rase wi ' , gin he had been buried wi ' a timmer-leg ? ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 3]: asked he .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 11]: `` His ain leg wad be buried some gait . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 4]: `` Ow ay !
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 3]: nae doubt .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 25]: An ' it wad come happin ' ower the Paceefic , or the Atlantic , to jine its oreeginal stump -- wad it no ?
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 20]: But supposin ' the man had been born _ wantin ' _ a leg -- eh , Thamas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 3]: `` George !
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 3]: George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 31]: said Thomas , with great solemnity , `` luik ye efter yer sowl , an ' the Lord ` ill luik after yer body , legs an ' a ' !
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 21]: Man , ye 're no convertit , an ' hoo can ye unnerstan ' the things o ' the speerit ?
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 10]: Aye jeerin ' , an ' jeerin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 3]: `` Weel !
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 2]: weel !
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 66]: Thamas , '' rejoined Macwha , mollified in perceiving that he had not had altogether the worst in the tilt of words ; `` I wad only tak ' the leeberty o ' thinkin ' that , when He was aboot it , the Almighty micht as weel mak ' a new body a ` thegither , as gang patchin ' up the auld ane .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 8]: Sae I s ' twa hame . ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 33]: `` Mind ye yer immortal pairt , George , '' said Thomas with a final thrust , as he likewise rose to go home with him on the box of the hearse .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 57]: `` Gin the Lord tak 's sic guid care o ' the body , Thamas , '' retorted Macwha , with less of irreverence than appeared in his words , `` maybe he winna objec ' to gie a look to my puir soul as weel ; for they say it 's worth a hantle mair .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 19]: I wish he wad , for he kens better nor me hoo to set aboot the job . ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 27]: So saying , he strode briskly over the graves and out of the churchyard , leaving Thomas to follow as fast as suited his unwieldy strength .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 37]: Meantime another conversation was going on in one of the gigs , as it bore two of the company from the place of tombs , which will serve a little for the purposes of this history .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 24]: One of the twain was a cousin of the deceased , already incidentally mentioned as taking some direction in the matter of refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 9]: His name was no less than Robert Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 16]: The other was called Andrew Constable , and was a worthy elder of the kirk .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 61]: `` Weel , Robert , '' began the latter , after they had jogged on in silence for half a mile or so , `` what 's to be done wi ' little Annie Anderson and her Auntie Meg , noo that the douce man 's gane hame , an ' left them theroot , as ' t war ? ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 21]: `` They canna hae that muckle to the fore efter the doctor an ' a ' 's sattled for . ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 8]: `` It 's no to be thought .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 21]: It 's lang sin ' ever he wrought a day 's darg -LRB- contracted from ` daywerk ' -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 13]: `` Jeames Dow luikit weel after the farmin ' , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 4]: `` Nae doot .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 15]: He 's a guid servant that , to ony man he ca 's master .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 11]: But there canna be muckle siller to the fore . ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 4]: A pause followed .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 9]: `` What think ye noo , Andrew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 3]: recommenced Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 14]: `` Ye 're weel kent for an honest an ' a langheided man .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 21]: Do ye think that folk wad expec ' onything o ' me gin the warst cam to the warst ? ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 29]: `` Weel , Robert , I dinna think there 's muckle guid in luikin ' to what fowk micht or micht not expec ' o ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 34]: `` That 's jist what I was thinkin ' mysel ' ; for , ye see , I hae a sma ' family o ' my ain to haud chowin ' already . ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 7]: `` Nae doot -- nae doot .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 15]: But -- '' `` Ay , ay ; I ken what ye wad say .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 73]: I maunna a ` thegither disregaird what fowk think , 'cause there 's the chop -LRB- shop -RRB- ; an ' gin I ance got -- no to say an ill name , but jist the wind o ' no being sae considerate as I micht hae been , there 's no sayin ' but twa or three micht gang by my door , and across to Jamie Mitchell 's yonner . ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 18]: `` Do ye what 's richt , Robert Bruce , and sae defy fowk and fairy . ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 12]: `` Na , na , that winna _ aye _ work .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 20]: A body maun tak ' care o ' their ain , else wha 's to do ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 47]: `` Weel , '' rejoined Andrew with a smile , for he understood Bruce well enough , although he pretended to have mistaken his meaning -- `` weel , gin the bairnie falls to you , nae doot ye maun take chairge o ' her . ''
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 16]: `` I dinna mean Jeames Anderson 's bairns -- I mean my ain bairns . ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 33]: `` Robert , whatever way ye decide , I houp it may be sic a deceesion as will admit o ' yer castin ' yer care upo ' _ Him _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 10]: `` I ken a ' aboot that , Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 42]: But my opeenion upo ' that text is jist this -- that ilka vessel has to haud the fill o ' ` t , and what rins ower may be committed to Him , for ye can haud it no langer .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 12]: Them that winna tak tent -LRB- care -RRB- 'll tak scathe .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 19]: It 's a sweer -LRB- lazy -RRB- thochtless way to gang to the Almichty wi ' ilka fash .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 15]: Whan I 'm driven to ane mair , that ane sall aye be Him .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 13]: Ye min ' the story about my namesake and the spidder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 10]: `` Ay , weel eneuch , '' answered Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 56]: But he did not proceed to remark that he could see no connection between that story and the subject in hand , for Bruce 's question did not take him by surprise , it being well understood that he was in the habit of making all possible and some impossible references to his great namesake .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 26]: Indeed , he wished everybody to think , though he seldom ventured to assert it plainly , that he was lineally descended from the king .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 53]: Nor did Andrew make further remark of any sort with regard to the fate of Annie or the duty of Bruce , for he saw that his companion wanted no advice -- only some talk , and possibly some sympathy with his perplexity as to what the world might think of him .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 43]: But with this perplexity Andrew could accord him very little sympathy indeed ; for he could not take much interest in the buttressing of a reputation which he knew to be already quite undermined by widely-reported acts of petty meanness and selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 23]: Nor was this fact much to be wondered at , if his principles were really those which he had so openly advocated .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 72]: Indeed , Andrew knew well that it would be a bad day for poor Annie when she came under Bruce 's roof , and therefore sincerely hoped that Auntie Meg might find some way of managing so as to avoid parting with the child ; for he knew , too , that , though her aunt was fierce and hard , she had yet a warm spot somewhere about her heart .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 18]: Margaret Anderson had known perfectly well for some time that she and Annie must part before long .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 39]: The lease of the farm would expire at the close of the autumn of next year ; and as it had been rather a losing affair for some time , she had no inclination to request a renewal .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 30]: When her brother 's debts should be paid , there would not remain , even after the sale of the stock , more than a hundred and fifty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 44]: For herself , she believed she must go into service -- which would hurt her pride more than it would alter her position , for her hands had done far more of the necessary labour than those of the maid who assisted her .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 16]: Indeed , in her proudest mood , she would have welcomed death rather than idleness .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 12]: What was to become of Annie she did not yet see .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 29]: Meantime there remained for the child just a year more of the native farm , with all the varieties of life which had been so dear to her .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 30]: Auntie Meg did not spare to put her in mind of the coming change ; but it seemed to Annie so long in coming that it never would come .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 32]: The impression was worn off by the daily attempt to deepen it , she gave herself up to the childish pleasures within her reach , without thinking of their approaching loss .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 11]: CHAPTER V. And why should Annie think of the future ?
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 14]: The future was not : the present was -- and full of delights .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 19]: If she did not receive much tenderness from auntie , at least she was not afraid of her .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 26]: The pungency of her temper was but as the salt and vinegar which brought out the true flavour of the other numberless pleasures around her .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 47]: Were her excursions far afield , perched aloft on Dowie 's shoulder , and holding on by the top of his head , or clinging to his back with her arms round his neck , at all the less delightful that auntie was scolding at home ?
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 46]: They would have been less delightful if she had thought of the future ; but she thought only of the present joy ; or rather she took it as it came , and let it play upon her , without thinking about it at all .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 88]: And if she was late for one of her meals , for Annie had no very correct sense of the lapse of time , and auntie had declared she should go fasting , it was yet not without her connivance that rosy-faced Betty got the child the best of everything that was at hand , and put cream in her milk , and butter on her oat cake , Annie managing to consume everything with satisfaction , notwithstanding the hurdy-gurdy accompaniment of her aunt 's audible reflections .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 38]: And Brownie was always friendly ; ever ready on any serious emergency , when auntie 's temper was still less placid than usual , to yield a corner of her manger for a refuge to the child .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 68]: And the cocks and hens , even the peacock and the turkey-cock , knew her perfectly , and would come when she called them , if not altogether out of affection for her , at least out of hope in her bounty ; and she had not yet arrived at the painful wisdom of beginning to question motives -- a wisdom which misleads more than it guides .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 13]: She loved _ them _ , and that was enough for her .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 57]: And she would ride the horses to water , sitting sideways on their broad backs like a barefooted lady ; for Dowie had such respect for his little mistress , as he called her , that he would never let her get astride `` like a laddie , '' however much she wanted to do so .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 62]: And when the morning was wet , and the sound of the flails came to her from the barn , she would watch for the moment when her aunt 's back would be turned , and then scurry across the yard , like a mouse to its hole ; for auntie 's first impulse was always to oppose whatever Annie desired .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 70]: Once in the barn , she would bury herself like a mole in the straw , and listen to the unfailing metronome of the flails , till she would fall so fast asleep as to awake only when her uncomfortable aunt , believing that at last the awful something or other _ had _ happened to the _ royt _ lassie , dragged her out ignominiously by the heels .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 29]: But the _ royt _ lassie was one of the gentlest of girls , what adventurousness she had being the result of faith , and not of hardihood .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 19]: And then came the delights of the harvest-field -- soon to become great golden splendours to the memory .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 25]: With the reapers she would remain from morning till night , sharing in their meals , and lightening their labour with her gentle frolic .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 40]: Every day , after the noon-tide meal , she would go to sleep on the shady side of a _ stook _ , upon two or three sheaves which Dowie would lay down for her in a choice spot .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 31]: Indeed the little mistress was very fond of sleep , and would go to sleep anywhere ; this habit being indeed one of her aunt 's chief grounds of complaint .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 47]: For before hay-time , for instance , when the grass was long in the fields , if she came upon any place that took her fancy , she would tumble down at once , and show that she loved it by going to sleep upon it .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 26]: Then it was no easy task to find her amidst the long grass that closed over her , as over a bird in its nest .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 22]: But the fact was , this habit indicated a feebleness of constitution , to which sleep itself was the best restorative .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 83]: And in the harvest-field , at least , no harm could come of it ; for Dooie , as she always called him , watched her like a mother ; so that sometimes when she awoke , she would find a second stook of ten sheaves , with a high-uplifted crowning pair above , built at right angles to the first , to shelter her from the sun which had peered round the corner , and would soon have stared her awake .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 18]: The only discomfort of the harvest-field was , that the sharp stubble forced her to wear shoes .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 72]: But when the corn had all been carried home , and the potatoes had been dug up and heaped in warm pits against the winter , and the mornings and evenings grew cold , and , though still friendly to strong men and women , were rather too keen for delicate little Annie -- she had to put on both shoes and stockings , which she did not like at all .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 49]: So with `` gentle gliding , '' through a whole winter of ice and snow , through a whole spring of promises tardily fulfilled , through a summer of glory , and another autumn of harvest joy , the day drew on when they must leave the farm .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 12]: And still to Annie it seemed as far off as ever .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 89]: One lovely evening in October , when the shadows were falling from the western sun , and the light that made them was as yellow as a marigold , and a keen little wind was just getting ready to come out and blow the moment the sun would be out of sight , Annie , who was helping to fasten up the cows for the night , drawing iron chains round their soft necks , saw a long shadow coming in at the narrow entrance of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 36]: It came in and in ; and was so long in coming in , that she began to feel as if it was something not quite _ cannie _ , and to fancy herself frightened .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 37]: But , at length , she found that the cause of the great shadow was only a little man ; and that this little man was no other than her father 's cousin , Robert Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 10]: how little a man may cast a great shadow !
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 26]: He came up to Annie , and addressed her in the smoothest voice he could find , fumbling at the same time in his coat-pocket .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 8]: `` Hoo are ye the nicht dawtie ?
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 5]: Are ye verra weel ?
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 8]: An ' hoo 's yer auntie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 15]: He waited for no reply to any of these questions , but went on .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 12]: `` See what I hae brocht ye frae the chop . ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 22]: So saying , he put into her hand about half-a-dozen _ sweeties _ , screwed up in a bit of paper .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 36]: With this gift he left her , and walked on to the open door of the house , which , as a cousin , he considered himself privileged to enter unannounced even by a knock .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 17]: He found the mistress of it in the kitchen , superintending the cooking of the supper .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 10]: `` Hoo are ye the nicht , Marget ? ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 28]: he said , still in a tone of conciliatory smoothness , through which , however , he could not prevent a certain hardness from cropping out plentifully .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 10]: `` Ye 're busy as usual , I see .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 15]: Weel , the hand o ' the diligent maketh rich , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 42]: `` That portion o ' the Word maun be o ' leemited application , I doot , '' returned Marget , as , withdrawing her hand from her cousin 's , she turned again to the pot hanging over the fire .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 31]: `` No man daurs to say that my han ' has not been the han ' o ' the diligent ; but Guid kens I 'm nane the richer . ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 7]: `` We maunna repine , Marget .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 12]: Richt or wrang , it 's the Lord 's will . ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 48]: `` It 's easy to you , Robert Bruce , wi ' yer siller i ' the bank , to speik that gait til a puir lone body like me , that maun slave for my bread whan I 'm no sae young as I micht be .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 14]: No that I 'm like to dee o ' auld age either . ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 23]: `` I haena sae muckle i ' the bank as some folk may think ; though what there is is safe eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 16]: But I hae a bonny business doun yonner , and it micht be better yet .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 19]: It 's jist the land o ' Goshen , only it wants a wheen mair tap-dressin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 12]: `` Tak it frae the bank , than , Robert . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 4]: `` The bank !
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 5]: said ye , Marget ?
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 6]: I canna do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 8]: `` And what for no ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 10]: 'Cause I 'm jist like the hens , Marget .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 19]: Gin they dinna see ae egg i ' the nest , they hae no hert to lay anither .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 9]: I daurna meddle wi ' the bank . ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 17]: `` Weel , lat sit than ; an ' lay awa ' at yer leisur ' .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 6]: Hoo 's the mistress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 10]: `` No that weel , and no that ill .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 9]: The faimily 's rather sair upo ' her .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 15]: But I canna haud her oot o ' the chop for a ' that .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 15]: She 's like mysel ' -- she wad aye be turnin ' a bawbee .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 13]: But what are ye gaein to do yersel ' , Marget ? ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 17]: `` I 'm gaein to my uncle and aunt -- auld John Peterson and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 17]: They 're gey and frail noo , and they want somebody to luik efter them . ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 12]: `` Than ye 're weel provided for ; Praise be thankit !
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 3]: Marget . ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 22]: `` Ow , ay ; nae doot , '' replied Marget , with bitterness , of which Bruce took no notice .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 12]: `` And what 's to come o ' the bairnie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 3]: pursued he .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 27]: `` I maun jist get some dacent auld body i ' the toon to tak ' her in , and lat her gang to the schuil .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 4]: It 's time .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 13]: The auld fowk wadna pit up wi ' her a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 11]: `` And what 'll that cost ye , Marget ? ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 5]: `` I dinna ken .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 14]: But the lassie 's able to pay for her ain upbringin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 20]: `` It 's no far ` at a hunner and fifty 'll gang i ' thae times , woman .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 12]: An ' it 's a pity to tak frae the prencipal .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 9]: She 'll be merryin ' some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 8]: `` Ow , ` deed , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 6]: Bairns will be fules . ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 27]: `` Weel , end na ye pit it oot at five per cent. , and there wad aye be something comin ' o ' ` t ?
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 33]: That wad be seven pun ' ten i ' the year , an ' the bairnie micht amaist -- no freely but nigh-han ' -- be broucht up upo ' that . ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 9]: Margaret lifted her head and looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 10]: `` An ' wha wad gie five per cent .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 26]: for her bit siller , whan he can get it frae the bank , on guid security , for four an ' a half ? ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 7]: `` Jist mysel ' , Marget .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 26]: The puir orphan has naebody but you and me to luik till ; an ' I wad willin ` ly do that muckle for her .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 14]: I 'll tell ye what -- I 'll gie her five per cent .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 59]: for her siller ; and for the bit interest , I 'll tak her in wi ' my ain bairns , an ' she s ' hae bit and sup wi ' them , an ' gang to the school wi ' them , and syne -- efter a bit -- we 'll see what comes neist . ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 9]: To Margaret this seemed a very fair offer .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 54]: It was known to all that the Bruce children were well-enough dressed for their station , and looked well-fed ; and although Robert had the character of being somewhat mean , she did not regard that as the worst possible fault , or one likely to operate for the injury of the child .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 23]: So she told her cousin that she would think about it ; which was quite as much as he could have expected .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 23]: He took his leave all but satisfied that he had carried his point , and not a little uplifted with his prospects .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 24]: For was it not a point worth carrying -- to get both the money and the owner of it into his own hands ?
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 9]: Not that he meant conscious dishonesty to Annie .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 50]: He only rejoiced to think that he would thus satisfy any expectations that the public might have formed of him , and would enjoy besides a splendid increase of capital for his business ; while he hoped to keep the girl upon less than the interest would come to .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 101]: And then , if anything should happen to her -- seeing she was not over vigorous -- the result was worth waiting for ; whereas -- if she throve -- he had sons growing up , one of whom might take a fancy to the heiress , and would have facilities for marrying her , & c. & c. ; for Grocer Robert was as deep in his foresight and scheming as King Robert , the crowning triumph of whose intellect , in the eyes of his descendant , was the strewing of the caltrops on the field of Bannockburn .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 21]: But James Dow was _ ill-pleased _ when he heard of the arrangement -- which was completed in due time .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 14]: `` For , '' said he , `` I canna bide that Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 7]: He 's a naisty mean cratur .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 21]: He wadna fling a bane till a dog , afore he had ta'en a pyke at it himsel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 90]: He agreed , however , with his mistress , that it would be better to keep Annie in ignorance of her destiny as long as possible ; a consideration which sprung from the fact that her aunt , now that she was on the eve of parting with her , felt a little delicate growth of tenderness sprouting over the old stone wall of her affection for the child , owing its birth , in part , to the doubt whether she would be comfortable in her new home .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 36]: A day that is fifty years off comes as certainly as if it had been in the next week ; and Annie 's feeling of infinite duration did not stop the sand-glass of Old Time .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 15]: The day arrived when everything was to be sold by public _ roup _ .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 41]: A great company of friends , neighbours , and acquaintances gathered ; and much drinking of whisky-punch went on in the kitchen as well as in the room where , a few months before , the solemn funeral-assembly had met .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 48]: Little Annie speedily understood what all the bustle meant : that the day of desolation so long foretold by the Cassandra-croak of her aunt , had at length actually arrived , and that all the things she knew so well were vanishing from her sight for ever .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 25]: She was in the barn when the sound of the auctioneer 's voice in the corn-yard made her look over the half-door and listen .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 34]: Gradually the truth dawned upon her ; and she burst into tears over an old rake which she had been accustomed to call hers , because she had always dragged it at hay-making .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 47]: Then wiping her eyes hastily -- for , partly from her aunt 's hardness , she never could bear to be seen crying , even when a child -- she fled to Brownie 's stall , and burying herself in the manger , began weeping afresh .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 79]: After a while , the fountain of tears was for the time exhausted , and she sat disconsolately gazing at the old cow feeding away , as if food were everything and a _ roup _ nothing at all , when footsteps approached the _ byre _ , and , to her dismay , two men , whom she did not know , came in , untied Brownie , and actually led her away from before her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 42]: She still stared at the empty space where Brownie had stood , -- stared like a creature stranded by night on the low coast of Death , before whose eyes in the morning the sea of Life is visibly ebbing away .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 6]: At last she started up .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 8]: How could she sit there without Brownie !
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 56]: Sobbing so that she could not breathe , she rushed across the yard , into the crowded and desecrated house , and up the stair to her own little room , where she threw herself on the bed , buried her eyes in the pillow , and , overcome with grief , fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 20]: When she woke in the morning , she remembered nothing of Betty 's undressing and putting her to bed .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 20]: The dreadful day that was gone seemed only a dreadful dream , that had left a pain behind it .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 17]: But when she went out , she found that yesterday would not stay amongst her dreams .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 6]: Brownie 's stall was empty .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 12]: The horses were all gone , and many of the cattle .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 8]: Those that remained looked like creatures forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 11]: The pigs were gone , and most of the poultry .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 17]: Two or three favourite hens were left , which auntie was going to take with her .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 18]: But of all the living creatures she had loved , not one had been kept for Annie .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 10]: Her life grew bitter with the bitterness of death .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 57]: In the afternoon , her aunt came up to her room , where she sat in tearful silence , and telling her that she was going to take her into the town , proceeded , without further explanation , to put all her little personal effects into an old hair-trunk , which Annie called her own .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 40]: Along with some trifles that lay about the room , she threw into the bottom of the box about a dozen of old books , which had been on the chest of drawers since long before Annie could remember .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 36]: She , poor child , let her do as she pleased , and asked no questions ; for the shadow in which she stood was darkening , and she did not care what came next .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 31]: For an hour the box stood on the floor like a coffin , and then Betty came , with red eyes and a red nose , and carried it downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 12]: Then auntie came up again , dressed in her Sunday clothes .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 35]: She put on Annie 's best frock and bonnet -- adorning the victim for sacrifice -- at least , so Annie 's face would have suggested -- and led her down to the door .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 7]: There stood a horse and cart .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 14]: In the cart was some straw , and a sack stuffed with hay .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 56]: As auntie was getting into the cart , Betty rushed out from somewhere upon Annie , caught her up , kissed her in a vehement and disorderly manner , and before her mistress could turn round in the cart , gave her into James Dow 's arms , and vanished with strange sounds of choking .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 68]: Dowie thought to put her in with a kiss , for he dared not speak ; but Annie 's arms went round his neck , and she clung to him sobbing -- clung till she roused the indignation of auntie , at the first sound of whose voice , Dowie was free , and Annie lying in the cart , with her face buried in the straw .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 37]: Dowie then mounted in front , with his feet on the shaft ; the horse -- one Annie did not know -- started off gently ; and she was borne away helpless to meet the unknown .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 8]: And the road was like the going .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 18]: She had often been upon it before , but it had never looked as it did now .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 11]: The first half-mile went through fields whose crops were gone .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 31]: The stubble was sticking through the grass , and the potato stalks , which ought to have been gathered and burnt , lay scattered about all over the brown earth .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 35]: Then came two miles of moorland country , high , and bleak , and barren , with hillocks of peat in all directions , standing beside the black holes whence they had been dug .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 31]: These holes were full of dark water , frightful to look at ; while along the side of the road went deep black ditches half-full of the same dark water .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 55]: There was no danger of the cart getting into them , for the ruts were too deep to let the wheels out ; but it jolted so dreadfully from side to side , as it crawled along , that Annie was afraid every other moment of being tilted into one of the frightful pools .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 25]: Across the waste floated now and then the cry of a bird , but other sound there was none in this land of drearihead .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 49]: Next came some scattered and ragged fields , the skirts of cultivation , which seemed to draw closer and closer together , while the soil grew richer and more hopeful , till , after two miles more , they entered the first straggling precincts of the grey market-town .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 45]: By this time the stars were shining clear in the cold , frosty sky , and candles or train-oil lamps were burning in most of the houses ; for all these things took place long before gas had been heard of in those quarters .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 26]: A few faces were pressed close to the window-panes as the cart passed ; and some rather untidy women came to the house-doors to look .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 37]: And they spoke one to another words which , though inaudible through the noise of the cart , were yet intelligible enough to Annie , with her own forebodings to interpret the expression of their faces .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 12]: `` That 'll be little Annie Anderson , '' they said .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 22]: `` She 's gaein hame to bide wi ' her cousin , Robert Bruce , up i ' the Wast Wynd .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 5]: Puir wee lassie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 14]: For , on the way , Annie had been informed of her destination .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 25]: But she was too miserable already , because of leaving her old home , to care much to what new one she was going .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 58]: Had it not been for the absorption of this grief , she could not have been indifferent to the prospect of going to live with her cousin , although her dislike to him had never assumed a more active form than that of wishing to get away from him , as often as he came near her .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 8]: The cart stopped at Bruce 's shop-door .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 18]: It looked a heavy door , although the upper half was of glass -- in small panes .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 22]: Dowie got down and went into the shop ; and before he returned Annie had time to make some listless observations .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 20]: The house was a low one , although of two stories , built of grey stone , and thatched .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 50]: The heavy door was between two windows belonging to the shop , in each of which burned a single tallow candle , revealing to the gaze of Annie , in all the enhancing mystery of candlelight , what she could not but regard as a perfect mine of treasures .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 48]: For besides calico and sugar , and all the multifarious stock in the combined trades of draper and grocer , Robert Bruce sold penny toys , and halfpenny picture-books , and all kinds of confectionery which had been as yet revealed to the belated generations of Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 36]: But she had not to contemplate these wonders long from the outside ; for Bruce came to the door , and , having greeted his cousin and helped her down , turned to take Annie .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 19]: Dowie had been before him , however , and now held the pale child silent in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 24]: He carried her into the shop , and set her down on a sack that stood outside the counter , leaning against it .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 10]: He then went back to his horse 's head .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 26]: The sack made no bad seat , for it was half-full of turnip-seed ; and upon it Annie sat , and drearily surveyed the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 10]: Auntie was standing in the middle of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 13]: Bruce was holding the counter open , and inviting her to enter .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 20]: `` Ye 'll come in and tak a cup o ' tay , efter yer journey , Marget ? ''
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 10]: `` Na , I thank ye , Robert Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 11]: Jeames and I maun jist turn and gae hame again .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 17]: There 's a hantle to look efter yet , and we maunna neglec ' oor wark .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 12]: The hoose-gear 's a ' to be roupit the morn . ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 45]: Then turning to Annie , she said : `` Noo , Annie , lass , ye 'll be a guid bairn , and do as ye 're tell ` t. An ' min ' and no pyke the things i ' the chop . ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 17]: A smile of peculiar import glimmered over Bruce 's face at the sound of this injunction .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 15]: Annie made no reply , but stared at Mr Bruce , and sat staring .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 8]: `` Good-bye to ye , Annie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 13]: said her aunt , and roused her a little from her stupor .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 28]: She then gave her a kiss -- the first , as far as the child knew , that she had ever given her -- and went out .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 10]: Bruce followed her out , and Dowie came in .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 20]: He took her up in his arms , and said : `` Good-bye to ye , my bonnie bairn .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 14]: Be a guid lass , and ye 'll be ta'en care o ' .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 4]: Dinna forget that .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 8]: Min ' and say yer prayers . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 13]: Annie kissed him with all her heart , but could not reply .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 10]: He set her down again , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 12]: She heard the harness rattle , and the cart go off .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 8]: She was left sitting on the sack .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 21]: Presently Mr Bruce came in , and passing behind his counter , proceeded to make an entry in a book .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 12]: It could have been no order from poor , homeless Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 29]: It was , in fact , a memorandum of the day and the hour when Annie was set down on that same sack -- so methodical was he !
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 21]: And yet it was some time before he seemed to awake to the remembrance of the presence of the child .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 45]: Looking up suddenly at the pale , weary thing , as she sat with her legs hanging lifelessly down the side of the sack , he said -- pretending to have forgotten her -- `` Ow , bairn , are ye there yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 49]: And going round to her , he set her on the floor , and leading her by the hand through the mysterious gate of the counter , and through a door behind it , called in a sharp decided tone : `` Mother , ye 're wanted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 17]: Thereupon a tall , thin , anxious-looking woman appeared , wiping her hands in her apron .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 18]: `` This is little Miss Anderson , '' said Bruce , `` come to bide wi 's .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 17]: Gie her a biscuit , and tak ' her up the stair till her bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 30]: As it was the first , so it was the last time he called her _ Miss _ Anderson , at least while she was one of his household .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 27]: -- Mrs Bruce took Annie by the hand in silence , and led her up two narrow stairs , into a small room with a skylight .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 14]: There , by the shine of the far-off stars , she undressed her .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 22]: But she forgot the biscuit ; and , for the first time in her life , Annie went supperless to bed .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 54]: She lay for a while trying to fancy herself in Brownie 's stall among the grass and clover , and so get rid of the vague fear she felt at being in a strange place without light , for she found it unpleasant not to know what was next her in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 39]: But the fate of Brownie and of everything she had loved came back upon her ; and the sorrow drove away the fear , and she cried till she could cry no longer , and then she slept .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 16]: It is by means of sorrow , sometimes , that He gives his beloved sleep .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 10]: She woke early , rose , and dressed herself .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 25]: But there was no water for her to wash with , and she crept down-stairs to look for help in this her first need .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 7]: Nobody , however , was awake .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 25]: She looked long and wistfully at the house-door , but seeing that she could not open it , she went back to her room .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 70]: If she had been at home , she would soon have had a joyous good-morrow from the burst of fresh wind meeting her as she lifted the ready latch , to seek the companionship of yet earlier risers than herself ; but now she was as lonely as if she had anticipated the hour of the resurrection , and was the little only one up of the buried millions .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 55]: All that she had left of that home was her box , and she would have betaken herself to a desolate brooding over its contents ; but it had not been brought up , and neither could she carry it up herself , nor would she open it in the kitchen where it stood .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 17]: So she sat down on the side of her bed , and gazed round the room .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 6]: It was a cheerless room .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 31]: At home she had had chequered curtains to her bed : here there were none of any kind ; and her eyes rested on nothing but bare rafters and boards .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 18]: And there were holes in the roof and round the floor , which she did not like .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 10]: They were not large , but they were dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 15]: For they were black , nor did she know where they might go to .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 6]: And she grew very cold .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 24]: At length she heard some noise in the house , and in her present mood any human noise was a sound of deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 30]: It grew ; was presently enriched by the admixture of baby-screams , and the sound of the shop-shutters being taken down ; and at last footsteps approached her door .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 18]: Mrs Bruce entered , and finding her sitting dressed on her bed , exclaimed : `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 5]: ye call dress yersel !
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 4]: can ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 16]: `` Ay , weel that , '' answered Annie , as cheerily as she could .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 20]: `` But , '' she added , `` I want some water to wash mysel ' wi ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 14]: `` Come doon to the pump , than , '' said Mrs Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 14]: Annie followed her to the pump , where she washed in a tub .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 25]: She then ran dripping into the house for a towel , and was dried by the hands of Mrs Bruce in her dirty apron .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 33]: -- This mode of washing lasted till the first hoar-frost , after which there was a basin to be had in the kitchen , with plenty of water and not much soap .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 65]: By this time breakfast was nearly ready , and in a few minutes more , Mrs Bruce called Mr Bruce from the shop , and the children from the yard , and they all sat round the table in the kitchen -- Mr Bruce to his tea and oat-cake and butter -- Mrs Bruce and the children to badly-made oatmeal porridge and sky-blue milk .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 16]: This quality of the milk was remarkable , seeing they had cows of their own .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 6]: But then they sold milk .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 75]: And if any customer had accused her of watering it , Mrs Bruce 's best answer would have been to show how much better what she sold was than what she retained ; for she put twice as much water in what she used for her own family -- with the exception of the portion destined for her husband 's tea , whose two graces were long and strong enough for a better breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 8]: But then his own was good enough .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 24]: There were three children , two boys with great jaws -- the elder rather older than Annie -- and a very little baby .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 28]: After Mr Bruce had prayed for the blessing of the Holy Spirit upon their food , they gobbled down their breakfasts with all noises except articulate ones .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 122]: When they had finished -- that is , eaten everything up -- the Bible was brought ; a psalm was sung , after a fashion not very extraordinary to the ears of Annie , or , indeed , of any one brought up in Scotland ; a chapter was read -- it happened to tell the story of Jacob 's speculations in the money-market of his day and generation ; and the _ exercise _ concluded with a prayer of a quarter of an hour , in which the God of Jacob especially was invoked to bless the Bruces , His servants , in their basket and in their store , and to prosper the labours of that day in particular .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 41]: The prayer would have been longer , but for the click of the latch of the shop-door , which brought it to a speedier close than one might have supposed even Mr Bruce 's notions of decency would have permitted .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 20]: And almost before the _ Amen _ was out of his month , he was out of the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 34]: When he had served the early customer , he returned , and sitting down , drew Annie towards him -- between his knees , in fact , and addressed her with great solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 31]: `` Noo , Annie , '' said he , `` ye s ' get the day to play yersel ' ; but ye maun gang to the school the morn .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 21]: We can hae no idle fowk i ' this hoose , sae we maun hae nae words aboot it . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 12]: Annie was not one to make words about that or anything .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 11]: She was only too glad to get away from him .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 22]: Indeed the prospect of school , after what she had seen of the economy of her home , was rather enticing .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 11]: So she only answered , `` Verra weel , sir .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 7]: Will I gang the day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 46]: Whereupon , finding her so tractable , Mr Bruce added , in the tone of one conferring a great favour , and knowing that he did so , `` Ye can come into the shop for the day , and see what 's gaein on .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 27]: Whan ye 're a muckle woman , ye may be fit to stan ' ahin ' the coonter some day yersel ' -- wha kens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 31]: Robert Bruce regarded the shop as his Bannockburn , where all his enemies , namely customers , were to be defeated , that he might be enriched with their spoils .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 26]: It was , therefore , a place of so great interest in his eyes , that he thought it must be interesting to everybody else .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 17]: And , indeed , the permission did awake some ill-grounded expectations in the mind of Annie .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 61]: She followed him into the shop , and saw quite a fabulous wealth of good things around her ; of which , however , lest she should put forth her hand and take , the militant eyes of Robert Bruce never ceased watching her , with quick-recurring glances , even while he was cajoling some customer into a doubtful purchase .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 23]: Long before dinner-time arrived , she was heartily sick of the monotony of buying and selling in which she had no share .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 43]: Not even a picture-book was taken down from the window for her to look at ; so that she soon ceased to admire even the picture-books -- a natural result of the conviction that they belonged to a sphere above her reach .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 47]: Mr Bruce , on the other hand , looked upon them as far below the notice of his children , although he derived a keen enjoyment from the transference , by their allurements , of the half-pence of other children from their pockets into his till .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 54]: `` Naisty trash o ' lees , '' he remarked , apparently for Annie 's behoof , as he hung the fresh bait up in his window , after two little urchins , with _ bawbees _ to spend , had bought a couple of the radiant results of literature and art combined .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 16]: `` Naisty trash o ' lees -- only fit for dirrty laddies and lassies . ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 23]: He stood on the watch in his shop like a great spider that ate children ; and his windows were his web .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 18]: They dined off salt herrings and potatoes -- much better fare than bad porridge and watered milk .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 73]: Robert Bruce the younger , who inherited his father 's name and disposition , made faces at Annie across the table as often as he judged it prudent to run the risk of discovery ; but Annie was too stupefied with the awful change to mind it much , and indeed required all the attention she had at command , for the arrest of herring bones on their way to her throat .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 48]: After dinner , business was resumed in the shop , with at least the resemblance of an increase of vigour , for Mrs Bruce went behind the counter , and gave her husband time to sit down at the desk to write letters and make out bills .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 38]: Not that there was much of either sort of clerkship necessary ; but Bruce , like Chaucer 's Man of Law , was so fond of business , that he liked to seem busier than he was .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 28]: As it happened to be a half-holiday , Annie was sent with the rest of the children into the garden to play up and down the walks .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 21]: `` An ' min ' , '' said Bruce , `` an ' haud oot ower frae the dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 16]: In the garden Annie soon found herself at the mercy of those who had none .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 25]: It is marvellous what an amount of latent torment there is in boys , ready to come out the moment an object presents itself .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 6]: It is not exactly cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 28]: The child that tears the fly to pieces does not represent to himself the sufferings the insect undergoes ; he merely yields to an impulse to disintegrate .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 25]: So children , even ordinarily good children , are ready to tease any child who simply looks teasable , and so provokes the act .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 29]: Now the Bruces were not good children , as was natural ; and they despised Annie because she was a girl , and because she had no self-assertion .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 48]: If she had shown herself aggressively disagreeable , they would have made some attempt to conciliate her ; but as it was , she became at once the object of a succession of spiteful annoyances , varying in intensity with the fluctuating invention of the two boys .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 40]: At one time they satisfied themselves with making grimaces of as insulting a character as they could produce ; at another they rose to the rubbing of her face with dirt , or the tripping up of her heels .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 61]: Their persecution bewildered her , and the resulting stupefaction was a kind of support to her for a time ; but at last she could endure it no longer , being really hurt by a fall , and ran crying into the shop , where she sobbed out , `` Please , sir , they winna lat me be . ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 11]: `` Dinna come into the chop wi ' yer stories .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 9]: Mak ' it up amo ' yersels . ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 10]: `` But they winna mak ' it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 24]: Robert Bruce rose indignant at such an interruption of his high calling , and went out with the assumption of much parental grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 47]: He was instantly greeted with a torrent of assurances that Annie had fallen , and then laid the blame upon them ; whereupon he turned sternly to her , and said -- `` Annie , gin ye tell lees , ye 'll go to hell . ''
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 21]: But paternal partiality did not prevent him from reading them also a lesson , though of a quite different tone .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 34]: `` Mind , boys , '' he said , in a condescending whine , `` that poor Annie has neither father nor mither ; an ' ye maun be kind till her . ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 25]: He then turned and left them for the more important concerns within-doors ; and the persecution recommenced , though in a somewhat mitigated form .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 17]: The little wretches were perfectly unable to abstain from indulging in a pleasure of such intensity .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 8]: Annie had indeed fallen upon evil days .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 50]: I am thus minute in my description of her first day , that my reader , understanding something similar of many following days , may be able to give due weight to the influence of other events , when , in due time , they come to be recorded .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 31]: But I must not conclude the account without mentioning something which befell her at the close of the same day , and threatened to be productive of yet more suffering .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 28]: After _ worship _ , the boys crawled away to bed , half-asleep already ; or , I should rather say , only half-awake from their prayers .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 3]: Annie lingered .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 21]: `` Can ye no tak ' aff yer ain claes , as weel as pit them on , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 4]: asked Mrs Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 6]: `` Ay , weel eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 29]: Only I wad sair like a bittie o ' can ` le , '' was Annie 's trembling reply , for she had a sad foreboding instinct now .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 5]: `` Can ` le !
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 11]: Na , na , bairn , '' answered Mrs Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 11]: `` Ye s ' get no can ` le here .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 18]: Ye wad hae the hoose in a low -LRB- flame -RRB- aboot oor lugs -LRB- ears -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 7]: I canna affoord can ` les .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 27]: Ye can jist mak ' a can ` le o ' yer han 's , and fin -LRB- feel -RRB- yer gait up the twa stairs .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 15]: There 's thirteen steps to the firs , and twal to the neist . ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 11]: With choking heart , but without reply , Annie went .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 16]: Groping her way up the steep ascent , she found her room without any difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 60]: As it was again a clear , starlit night , there was light enough for her to find everything she wanted ; and the trouble at her heart kept her imagination from being as active as it would otherwise have been , in recalling the terrible stories of ghosts and dead people with which she was far too familiar .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 48]: She soon got into bed , and , as a precautionary measure , buried her head under the clothes before she began to say her prayers , which , under the circumstances , she had thought she might be excused for leaving till she had lain down .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 23]: But her prayers were suddenly interrupted by a terrible noise of scrambling and scratching and scampering in the very room beside her .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 42]: `` I tried to cry oot , '' she said afterwards , `` for I kent ` at it was rottans ; but my tongue booed i ' my mou ' for fear , and I cudna speak ae word . ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 12]: The child 's fear of rats amounted to a frenzied horror .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 7]: She dared not move a finger .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 22]: To get out of bed with those creatures running about the room was as impossible as it was to cry out .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 33]: But her heart did what her tongue could not do -- cried out with a great and bitter cry to one who was more ready to hear than Robert and Nancy Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 22]: And what her heart cried was this : `` O God , tak care o ' me frae the rottans . ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 24]: There was no need to send an angel from heaven in answer to this little one 's prayer : the cat would do .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 11]: Annie heard a scratch and a mew at the door .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 10]: The rats made one frantic scramble and were still .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 6]: `` It 's pussy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 15]: she cried , recovering the voice for joy that had failed her for fear .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 46]: Fortified by her arrival , and still more by the feeling that she was a divine messenger sent to succour her because she had prayed , she sprang out of bed , darted across the room , and opened the door to let her in .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 33]: A few moments and she was fast asleep , guarded by God 's angel , the cat , for whose entrance she took good care ever after to leave the door ajar .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 25]: There are ways of keeping the door of the mind also , ready as it is to fall to , ajar for the cat .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 32]: `` Noo , Annie , pit on yer bonnet , an ' gang to the schuil wi ' the lave -LRB- rest -RRB- ; an ' be a good girrl . ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 55]: This was the Bruce 's parting address to Annie , before he left the kitchen for the shop , after breakfast and worship had been duly observed ; and having just risen from his knees , his voice , as he stooped over the child , retained all the sanctity of its last occupation .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 17]: It was a quarter to ten o'clock , and the school was some five minutes distant .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 10]: With a flutter of fearful hope , Annie obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 38]: She ran upstairs , made herself as tidy , as she could , smoothed her hair , put on her bonnet , and had been waiting a long time at the door when her companions joined her .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 15]: It was very exciting to look forward to something that might not be disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 19]: As they went , the boys got one on each side of her in a rather sociable manner .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 26]: But they had gone half the distance and not a word had been spoken , when Robert Bruce , junior , opened the conversation abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 7]: `` Ye 'll get it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 23]: he said , as if he had been brooding upon the fact for some time , and now it had broken out .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 7]: `` What 'll I get ? ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 14]: asked Annie timidly , for his tone had already filled her with apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 36]: `` Sic lickins , '' answered the little wretch , drawing back his lips till his canine teeth were fully disclosed , as if he gloated in a carnivorous sort of way over the prospect .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 7]: `` Wonna she , Johnnie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 15]: `` Ay wull she , '' answered Johnnie , following his leader with confidence .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 7]: Annie 's heart sank within her .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 10]: The poor little heart was used to sinking now .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 20]: But she said nothing , resolved , if possible , to avoid all occasion for `` getting it . ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 20]: Not another word was spoken before they reached the school , the door of which was not yet open .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 42]: A good many boys and a few girls were assembled , waiting for the master , and filling the lane , at the end of which the school stood , with the sound of voices fluctuating through a very comprehensive scale .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 44]: In general the school-door was opened a few minutes before the master 's arrival , but on this occasion no one happened to have gone to his house to fetch the key , and the scholars had therefore to wait in the street .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 21]: None of them took any notice of Annie ; so she was left to study the outside of the school .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 35]: It was a long , low , thatched building , of one story and a garret , with five windows to the lane , and some behind , for she could see light through .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 24]: It had been a weaving-shop originally , full of hand-looms , when the trade in linen was more prosperous than it was now .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 17]: From the thatch some of the night 's frost was already dripping in slow clear drops .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 32]: Past the door , which was in a line with the windows , went a gutter , the waters of which sank through a small grating a few steps further on .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 10]: But there was no water running in it now .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 14]: Suddenly a boy cried out : `` The maister 's comin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 10]: and instantly the noise sunk to a low murmur .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 22]: Looking up the lane , which rose considerably towards the other end , Annie saw the figure of the descending dominie .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 27]: He was dressed in what seemed to be black , but was in reality gray , almost as good as black , and much more thrifty .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 31]: He came down the hill swinging his arms , like opposing pendulums , in a manner that made the rapid pace at which he approached like a long slow trot .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 39]: With the door-key in his hand , already pointed towards the key-hole , he went right through the little crowd , which cleared a wide path for him , without word or gesture of greeting on either side .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 37]: I might almost say he swooped upon the door , for with one hand on the key , and the other on the latch , he seemed to wrench it open the moment he touched it .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 55]: In he strode , followed at the heels by the troop of boys , big and little , and lastly by the girls -- last of all , at a short distance , by Annie , like a motherless lamb that followed the flock , because she did not know what else to do .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 33]: She found she had to go down a step into a sunk passage or lobby , and then up another step , through a door on the left , into the school .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 20]: There she saw a double row of desks , with a clear space down the middle between the rows .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 22]: Each scholar was hurrying to his place at one of the desks , where , as he arrived , he stood .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 44]: The master already stood in solemn posture at the nearer end of the room on a platform behind his desk , prepared to commence the extempore prayer , which was printed in a kind of blotted stereotype upon every one of their brains .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 16]: Annie had hardly succeeded in reaching a vacant place among the girls when he began .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 96]: The boys were as still as death while the master prayed ; but a spectator might easily have discovered that the chief good some of them got from the ceremony was a perfect command of the organs of sound ; for the restraint was limited to those organs ; and projected tongues , deprived of their natural exercise , turned themselves , along with winking eyes , contorted features , and a wild use of hands and arms , into the means of telegraphic despatches to all parts of the room , throughout the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 35]: The master , afraid of being himself detected in the attempt to combine prayer and vision , kept his `` eyelids screwed together tight , '' and played the spy with his ears alone .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 39]: The boys and girls , understanding the source of their security perfectly , believed that the eyelids of the master would keep faith with them , and so disported themselves without fear in the delights of dumb show .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 21]: As soon as the prayer was over they dropped , with no little noise and bustle , into their seats .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 40]: But presently Annie was rudely pushed out of her seat by a hoydenish girl , who , arriving late , had stood outside the door till the prayer was over , and then entered unperceived during the subsequent confusion .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 33]: Some little ones on the opposite form , however , liking the look of her , and so wishing to have her for a companion , made room for her beside them .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 17]: The desks were double , so that the two rows at each desk faced each other .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 27]: `` Bible-class come up , '' were the first words of the master , ringing through the room , and resounding awfully in Annie 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 39]: A moment of chaos followed , during which all the boys and girls , considered capable of reading the Bible , were arranging themselves in one great crescent across the room in front of the master 's desk .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 84]: Each read a verse -- neither more nor less -- often leaving the half of a sentence to be taken up as a new subject in a new key ; thus perverting what was intended as an assistance to find the truth into a means of hiding it -- a process constantly repeated , and with far more serious results , when the words of truth fall , not into the hands of the incapable , but under the protection of the ambitious .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 42]: The chapter that came in its turn was one to be pondered over by the earnest student of human nature , not one to be blundered over by boys who had still less reverence for humanity than they had for Scripture .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 47]: It was a good thing that they were not the sacred fountains of the New Testament that were thus dabbled in -- not , however , that the latter were considered at all more precious or worthy ; as Saturday and the Shorter Catechism would show .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 26]: Not knowing the will of the master , Annie had not dared to stand up with the class , although she could read very fairly .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 38]: A few moments after it was dismissed she felt herself overshadowed by an awful presence , and , looking up , saw , as she had expected , the face of the master bending down over her .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 55]: He proceeded to question her , but for some time she was too frightened to give a rational account of her acquirements , the best of which were certainly not of a kind to be appreciated by the master , even if she had understood them herself sufficiently to set them out before him .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 56]: For , besides her aunt , who had taught her to read , and nothing more , her only instructors had been Nature , with her whole staff , including the sun , moon , and wind ; the grass , the corn , Brownie the cow , and her own faithful subject , Dowie .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 23]: Still , it was a great mortification to her to be put into the spelling-book , which excluded her from the Bible-class .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 27]: She was also condemned to follow with an uncut quill , over and over again , a single straight stroke , set her by the master .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 14]: Dreadfully dreary she found it , and over it she fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 25]: Her head dropped on her outstretched arm , and the quill dropped from her sleeping fingers -- for when Annie slept she all slept .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 12]: But she was soon roused by the voice of the master .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 5]: `` Ann Anderson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 27]: it called in a burst of thunder to her ear ; and she awoke to shame and confusion , amidst the titters of those around her .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 24]: Before the morning was over she was called up , along with some children considerably younger than herself , to read and spell .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 45]: The master stood before them , armed with a long , thick strap of horse-hide , prepared by steeping in brine , black and supple with constant use , and cut into fingers at one end , which had been hardened in the fire .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 19]: Now there was a little pale-faced , delicate-looking boy in the class , who blundered a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 25]: Every time he did so the cruel serpent of leather went at him , coiling round his legs with a sudden , hissing swash .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 28]: This made him cry , and his tears blinded him so that he could not even see the words which he had been unable to read before .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 70]: But he still attempted to go on , and still the instrument of torture went swish-swash round his little thin legs , raising upon them , no doubt , plentiful blue wales , to be revealed , when he was undressed for the night , to the indignant eyes of pitying mother or aunt , who would yet send him back to the school the next morning without fail .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 46]: At length either the heart of the master was touched by the sight of his sufferings and repressed weeping , or he saw that he was compelling the impossible ; for he stayed execution , and passed on to the next , who was Annie .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 41]: It was no wonder that the trembling child , who could read very fairly , should yet , after such an introduction to the ways of school , fail utterly in making anything like coherence of the sentence before her .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 28]: What she would have done , had she been left to herself , would have been to take the little boy in her arms and cry too .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 47]: As it was , she struggled mightily with her tears , and yet she did not read to much better purpose than the poor boy , who was still busy wiping his eyes with his sleeves , alternately , for he never had had a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 32]: But being a new-comer , and a girl to boot , and her long frock affording no facilities for this kind of incentive to learning , she escaped for the time .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 16]: It was a dreadful experience of life , though , that first day at school .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 39]: Well might the children have prayed with David -- `` Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord , for his mercies are great ; and let us not fall into the hand of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 17]: And well might the children at many another school respond with a loud _ Amen _ !
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 18]: At one o'clock they were dismissed , and went home to dinner , to return at three .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 13]: In the afternoon she was set to make figures on a slate .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 8]: She made figures till her back ached .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 57]: The monotony of this occupation was relieved only by the sight of the execution of criminal law upon various offending boys ; for , as must be already partially evident , the master was a hard man , with a severe , if not an altogether cruel temper , and a quite savage sense of duty .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 64]: The punishment was mostly in the form of _ pandies _ , -- blows delivered with varying force , but generally with the full swing of the _ tag _ , as it was commonly called , thrown over the master 's shoulder , and brought down with the whole strength of his powerful right arm upon the outstretched hand of the culprit .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 38]: But there were other modes of punishment , of which the restraints of art would forbid the description , even if it were possible for any writer to conquer his disgust so far as to attempt it .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 5]: Annie shivered and quaked .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 21]: Once she burst out crying , but managed to choke her sobs , if she could not hide her tears .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 60]: A fine-looking boy , three or four years older than herself , whose open countenance was set off by masses of dark brown hair , was called up to receive chastisement , merited or unmerited as the case might be ; for such a disposition as that of Murdoch Malison must have been more than ordinarily liable to mistake .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 11]: Justice , according to his idea , consisted in vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 7]: And he was fond of justice .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 31]: He did not want to punish the innocent , it is true ; but I doubt whether the discovery of a boy 's innocence was not a disappointment to him .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 59]: Without a word of expostulation or defence , the boy held out his hand , with his arm at full length , received four stinging blows upon it , grew very red in the face , gave a kind of grotesque smile , and returned to his seat with the suffering hand sent into retirement in his trowsers-pocket .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 35]: Annie 's admiration of his courage as well as of his looks , though perhaps unrecognizable as such by herself , may have had its share with her pity in the tears that followed .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 64]: Somehow or other , at all events , she made up her mind to bear more patiently the persecutions of the little Bruces , and , if ever her turn should come to be punished , as no doubt it would , whether she deserved it or not , to try to take the whipping as she had seen Alec Forbes take it .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 3]: Poor Annie !
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 13]: If it should come to that -- nervous organizations are so different !
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 17]: At five , the school was dismissed for the day , not without another extempore prayer .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 15]: A succession of jubilant shouts arose as the boys rushed out into the lane .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 15]: Every day to them was a cycle of strife , suffering , and deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 49]: Birth and death , with the life-struggle between , were shadowed out in it -- with this difference , that the God of a corrupt Calvinism , in the person of Murdoch Malison , ruled that world , and not the God revealed in the man Christ Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 24]: And most of them having felt the day more or less a burden , were now going home to heaven for the night .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 12]: Annie , having no home , was amongst the few exceptions .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 21]: Dispirited and hopeless -- a terrible condition for a child -- she wondered how Alec Forbes could be so merry .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 21]: But he had had his evil things , and they were over ; while hers were all about her still .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 33]: She had but one comfort left -- that no one would prevent her from creeping up to her own desolate garret , which was now the dreary substitute for Brownie 's stall .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 11]: Thither the persecuting boys were not likely to follow her .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 25]: And if the rats were in that garret , so was the cat ; or at least the cat knew the way to it .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 22]: There she might think in peace about some things about which she had never before seemed to have occasion to think .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 36]: CHAPTER X. Thus at home , if home it could be called , and at school , Annie 's days passed -- as most days pass -- with family resemblance and individual difference wondrously mingled .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 35]: She became interested in what she had to learn , if not from the manner in which it was presented to her comprehension , yet from the fact that she had to learn it .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 22]: Happily or unhappily , too , she began to get used to the sight of the penal suffering of her schoolfellows .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 70]: Nor had anything of the kind as yet visited her ; for it would have been hard for even a more savage master than Mr Malison to find occasion , now that the first disabling influences had passed away , to punish the nervous , delicate , anxious little orphan , who was so diligent , and as quiet as a mouse that fears to awake a sleeping cat .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 31]: She had a scared look too , that might have moved the heart of Malison even , if he had ever paid the least attention to the looks of children .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 62]: For the absence of human companionship in bestial forms ; the loss of green fields , free to her as to the winds of heaven , and of country sounds and odours ; and an almost constant sense of oppression from the propinquity of one or another whom she had cause to fear , were speedily working sad effects upon her .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 11]: The little colour she had died out of her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 19]: Her face grew thin , and her blue eyes looked wistful and large out of their sulken cells .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 28]: Not often were tears to be seen in them now , and yet they looked well acquainted with tears -- like fountains that had been full yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 13]: She never smiled , for there was nothing to make her smile .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 43]: But she gained one thing by this desolation : the thought of her dead father came to her , as it had never come before ; and she began to love him with an intensity she had known nothing of till now .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 48]: Her mother had died at her birth , and she had been her father 's treasure ; but in the last period of his illness she had seen less of him , and the blank left by his death had , therefore , come upon her gradually .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 13]: Before she knew what it was , she had begun to forget .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 15]: In the minds of children the grass grows very quickly over their buried dead .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 58]: But now she learned what death meant , or rather what love had been ; not , however , as an added grief : it comforted her to remember how her father had loved her ; and she said her prayers the oftener , because they seemed to go somewhere near the place where her father was .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 21]: She did not think of her father being where God was , but of God being where her father was .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 16]: The winter was drawing nearer too , and the days were now short and cold .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 17]: A watery time began , and for many days together the rain kept falling without intermission .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 17]: I almost think Annie would have died , but for her dead father to think about .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 28]: On one of those rainy days , however , she began to find that it is in the nature of good things to come in odd ways .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 37]: It had rained the whole day , not tamely and drizzingly , but in real earnest , dancing and rebounding from the pools , and raising a mist by the very `` crash of water-drops . ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 49]: Now and then the school became silent , just to listen to the wide noise made by the busy cataract of the heavens , each drop a messenger of good , a sweet returning of earth 's aspirations , in the form of Heaven 's _ Amen _ !
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 65]: But the boys thought only of the fun of dabbling in the torrents as they went home ; or the delights of net-fishing in the swollen and muddy rivers , when the fish no longer see their way , but go wandering about in perplexity , just as we human mortals do in a thick fog , whether of the atmosphere or of circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 5]: The afternoon was waning .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 17]: It was nearly time to go ; and still the rain was pouring and plashing around .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 52]: In the gathering gloom there had been more than the usual amount of wandering from one part of the school to another , and the elder Bruce had stolen to a form occupied by some little boys , next to the one on which Annie sat with her back towards them .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 45]: If it was not the real object of his expedition , at least he took the opportunity to give Annie a spiteful dig with his elbow ; which , operating even more powerfully than he had intended , forced from her an involuntary cry .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 79]: Now the master indulged in an occasional refinement of the executive , which consisted in this : he threw the _ tawse _ at the offender , not so much for the sake of hurting -- although that , being a not infrequent result , may be supposed to have had a share in the intention -- as of humiliating ; for the culprit had to bear the instrument of torture back to the hands of the executioner .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 22]: He threw the tawse at Annie , half , let us suppose , in thoughtless cruelty , half in evil jest .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 19]: It struck her rather sharply , before she had recovered breath after the blow Bruce had given her .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 41]: Ready to faint with pain and terror , she rose , pale as death , and staggered up to the master , carrying the tawse with something of the same horror she would have felt had it been a snake .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 13]: With a grim smile , he sent her back to her seat .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 20]: The moment she reached it her self-control gave way , and she burst into despairing , though silent tears .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 29]: The desk was still shaking with her sobs , and some of the girls were still laughing at her grief , when a new occurrence attracted their attention .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 30]: Through the noise of the falling rain a still louder rushing of water was heard , and the ears and eyes of all sought the source of the sound .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 14]: Even Annie turned her wet cheeks and overflowing eyes languidly towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 7]: Mr Malison went and opened it .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 14]: A flood of brown water was pouring into the sunk passage already described .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 39]: The grating by which the rain-torrent that flowed past the door should have escaped , had got choked , the stream had been dammed back , and in a few moments more the room itself would be flooded .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 10]: Perceiving this , the master hastily dismissed his pupils .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 25]: There could be no better fun for most of the boys and some of the girls , than to wade through the dirty water .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 33]: Many of the boys dashed through it at once , shoes and all ; but some of the boys , and almost all the girls , took off their shoes and stockings .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 39]: When Annie got a peep of the water , writhing and tumbling in the passage , it looked so ugly , that she shrunk from fording it , especially if she must go in with her bare feet .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 14]: She could not tell what might be sweeping about in that filthy whirlpool .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 57]: She was still looking at it as it kept rising , in pale perplexity and dismay , with the forgotten tears still creeping down her checks , when she was caught up from behind by a boy , who , with his shoes and stockings in one hand , now seated her on the other arm .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 29]: She peeped timidly round to see who it was , and the brave brown eyes of Alec Forbes met hers , lighted by a kind , pitying smile .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 22]: In that smile the cloudy sky of the universe gently opened , and the face of God looked out upon Annie .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 26]: It gave her , for the moment , all that she had been dying for want of for many weeks -- weeks long as years .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 32]: She could not help it -- she threw her arms round Alec Forbes 's neck , laid her wet cheek against his , and sobbed as if her heart would break .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 18]: She did not care for the Bruces , or the rats , or even the schoolmaster now .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 29]: Alec clasped her tighter , and vowed in his heart that if ever that brute Malison lifted the tag to her , he would fly at his throat .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 58]: He would have carried her all the way home , for she was no great weight ; but as soon as they were out of the house Annie begged him to set her down so earnestly , that he at once complied , and , bidding her good night , ran home barefoot through the flooded roads .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 41]: The Bruces had gone on with the two umbrellas , one of which , more to her discomfort than protection , Annie had shared in coming to the school ; so that she was very wet before she got home .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 41]: But no notice was taken of the condition she was in ; the consequence of which was a severe cold and cough , which however , were not regarded as any obstacles to her going to school the next day .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 73]: That night she lay awake for a long time , and when at last she fell asleep , she dreamed that she took Alec Forbes home to see her father -- out the street and the long road ; over the black moor , and through the fields ; in at the door of the house , and up the stair to her father 's room , where he lay in bed .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 22]: And she told him how kind Alec had been to her , and how happy she was going to be now .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 36]: And her father put his hand out of the bed , and laid it on Alec 's head , and said : `` Thank ye , Alec for being kind to my poor Annie . ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 25]: And then she cried , and woke crying -- strange tears out of dreamland , half of delicious sorrow and half of trembling joy .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 28]: With what altered feelings she seated herself after the prayer , next day , and glanced round the room to catch a glimpse of her new friend !
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 8]: There he was , radiant as usual .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 16]: He took no notice of her , and she had not expected that he would .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 64]: But it was not long before he found out , now that he was interested in her , that her cousins were by no means friendly to her ; for their seats were not far from the girl 's quarter , and they took every sheltered opportunity of giving her a pinch or a shove , or of making vile grimaces at her .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 43]: In the afternoon , while she was busy over an addition sum which was more than usually obstinate , Robert came stealthily behind her , and , licking his hand , watched his opportunity , and rubbed the sum from her slate .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 26]: The same moment he received a box on the ear , that no doubt filled his head with more noises than that of the impact .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 38]: He yelled with rage and pain , and , catching sight of the administrator of justice as he was returning to his seat , bawled out in a tone of fierce complaint : `` Sanny Forbes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 4]: `` Alexander Forbes !
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 11]: come up , '' responded the voice of the master .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 29]: Forbes not being a first-rate scholar , was not a favourite with him , for Mr Malison had no sense for what was fine in character or disposition .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 24]: Had the name been that of one of his better Latin scholars , the cry of Bruce would most likely have passed unheeded .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 18]: `` Hold up your hand , '' he said , without requesting or waiting for an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 3]: Alec obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 19]: Annie gave a smothered shriek , and , tumbling from her seat , rushed up to the master .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 20]: When she found herself face to face with the tyrant , however , not one word could she speak .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 18]: She opened her mouth , but throat and tongue refused their offices , and she stood gasping .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 34]: The master stared , his arm arrested in act to strike , and his face turned over his left shoulder , with all the blackness of his anger at Forbes lowering upon Annie .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 41]: He stood thus for one awful moment , then motioning her aside with a sweep of his head , brought down the tawse upon the hand which Alec had continued to hold outstretched , with the vehemence of accumulated wrath .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 20]: Annie gave a choking cry , and Alec , so violent was the pain , involuntarily withdrew his hand .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 23]: But instantly , ashamed of his weakness , he presented it again , and received the remainder of his punishment without flinching .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 37]: The master then turned to Annie ; and finding her still speechless , gave her a push that nearly threw her on her face , and said , `` Go to your seat , Ann Anderson .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 13]: The next time you do that I will punish you severely . ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 10]: Annie sat down , and neither sobbed nor cried .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 11]: But it was days before she recovered from the shock .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 44]: Once , long after , when she was reading about the smothering of the princes in the Tower , the whole of the physical sensations of those terrible moments returned upon her , and she sprang from her seat in a choking agony .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 33]: For some time neither of the Bruces ventured even to make a wry face at her in school ; but their behaviour to her at home was only so much the worse .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 28]: Two days after the events recorded , as Annie was leaving the kitchen , after worship , to go up to bed , Mr Bruce called her .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 17]: `` Annie Anderson , '' he said , `` I want to speak to ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 5]: Annie turned , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 30]: `` I see ye ken what it 's aboot , '' he went on , staring her full in the pale face , which grew paler as he stared .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 10]: `` Ye canna luik me i ' the face .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 9]: Whaur 's the candy-sugar an ' the prunes ?
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 14]: I ken weel eneuch whaur they are , and sae do ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 18]: `` I ken naething aboot them , '' answered Annie , with a sudden revival of energy .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 6]: `` Dinna lee , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 12]: It 's ill eneuch to steal , without leein ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 17]: `` I 'm no leein ' , '' answered she , bursting into tears of indignation .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 10]: `` Wha said ` at I took them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 8]: `` That 's naething to the pint .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 10]: Ye wadna greit that gait gin ye war innocent .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 6]: I never missed onything afore .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 23]: And ye ken weel eneuch there 's an ee that sees a ' thing , and ye canna hide frae hit . ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 23]: Bruce could hardly have intended that it was by inspiration from on high that he had discovered the thief of his sweets .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 17]: But he thought it better to avoid mentioning that the informer was his own son Johnnie .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 26]: Johnnie , on his part , had thought it better not to mention that he had been incited to the act by his brother Robert .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 36]: And Robert had thought it better not to mention that he did so partly to shield himself , and partly out of revenge for the box on the ear which Alec Forbes had given him .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 58]: The information had been yielded to the inquisition of the parent , who said with truth that he had never missed anything before ; although I suspect that a course of petty and cautious pilfering had at length passed the narrow bounds within which it could be concealed from the lynx eyes inherited from the kingly general .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 46]: Possibly a bilious attack , which confined the elder boy to the house for two or three days , may have had something to do with the theft ; but if Bruce had any suspicions of the sort , he never gave utterance to them .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 14]: `` I dinna want to hide frae ` t , '' cried Annie .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 26]: `` Guid kens , '' she went on in desperation , `` that I wadna touch a grain o ' saut wantin ' leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 24]: `` It 's a pity , Annie , that some fowk dinna get their ain share o ' Mr Malison 's tards . ''
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 16]: -LRB- _ Tards _ was considered a more dignified word than _ tag _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 32]: `` I dinna like to lick ye mysel ' , 'cause ye 're ither fowk 's bairn ; but I can hardly haud my han 's aff o ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 22]: It must not be supposed from this speech that Robert Bruce ever ventured to lay his hands on his own children .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 45]: He was too much afraid of their mother , who , perfectly submissive and sympathetic in ordinary , would have flown into the rage of a hen with chickens if even her own husband had dared to chastise one of _ her _ children .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 20]: The shop might be more Robert 's than hers , but the children were more hers than Robert 's .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 30]: Overcome with shame and righteous anger , Annie burst out in the midst of fresh tears : `` I wish Auntie , wad come an tak me awa ' !
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 10]: It 's an ill hoose to be in . ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 9]: These words had a visible effect upon Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 29]: He expected a visit from Marget Anderson within a day or two ; and he did not know what the effect of the representations of Annie might be .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 59]: The use of her money had not been secured to him for any lengthened period -- Dowie , anxious to take all precautions for his little mistress , having consulted a friendly lawyer on the subject , lest she should be left defenceless in the hands of a man of whose moral qualities Dowie had no exalted opinion .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 32]: The sale having turned out better than had been expected , the sum committed to Bruce was two hundred pounds , to lose which now would be hardly less than ruin .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 44]: He thought it better , therefore , not doubting Annie to be the guilty person , to count the few lumps of sugar he might lose , as an additional trifle of interest , and not quarrel with his creditor for extorting it .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 45]: So with the weak cunning of his kind , he went to the shop , and bringing back a bit of sugar-candy , about the size of a pigeon 's egg , said to the still weeping child : `` Dinna greit , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 9]: I canna bide to see ye greitin ' .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 24]: Gin ye want a bittie o ' sugar ony time , jist tell me , an ' dinna gang helpin ' yoursel ' .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 5]: That 's a ' .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 3]: Hae . ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 46]: He thrust the lump into Annie 's hand ; but she dropped it on the floor with disgust , and rushed up-stairs to her bed as fast as the darkness would let her : where , notwithstanding her indignation , she was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 15]: Bruce searched for the sugar-candy which she had rejected , until he found it .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 42]: He then restored it to the drawer whence he had taken it -- which he could find in the dark with perfect ease -- resolving as he did so , to be more careful in future of offending little Annie Anderson .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 26]: When the day arrived upon which he expected Marget 's visit , that being a Saturday , Bruce was on the watch the whole afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 42]: From his shop-door he could see all along the street , and a good way beyond it ; and being very quick-sighted , he recognized Marget at a great distance by her shawl , as she sat in a slow-nearing cart .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 4]: `` Annie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 15]: he called , opening the inner door , as he returned behind the counter .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 13]: Annie , who was up-stairs in her own room , immediately appeared .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 37]: `` Annie , '' he said , `` rin oot at the back door , and through the yard , and ower to Laurie Lumley 's , and tell him to come ower to me direckly .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 6]: Dinna come back withoot him .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 7]: There 's a guid bairn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 41]: He sent her upon this message , knowing well enough that the man had gone into the country that day , and that there was no one at his house who would be likely to know where he had gone .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 27]: He hoped , therefore , that she would go and look for him in the town , and so be absent during her aunt 's visit .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 34]: `` Weel , Marget , '' he said , with his customary greeting , in which the foreign oil sought to overcome the home-bred vinegar , `` hoo are ye the day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 11]: nae that ill , '' answered Marget with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 10]: `` And hoo 's Mr and Mistress Peterson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 3]: `` Brawly .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 8]: Hoo 's Annie comin ' on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 5]: `` Nae that ill .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 10]: She 's some royt -LRB- riotous -RRB- jist . ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 21]: He thought to please her by the remark , because she had been in the habit of saying so herself .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 28]: But distance had made Annie dearer ; and her aunt 's nose took fire with indignation , as she replied : `` The lassie 's weel eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 12]: _ I _ saw naething o ' the sort aboot her .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 14]: Gin ye canna guide her , that 's _ your _ wyte . ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 8]: Bruce was abashed , but not confounded .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 7]: He was ready in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 21]: `` I never kent ony guid come o ' bein ' ower sair upo ' bairns , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 31]: `` She 's as easy guidit as a coo gaein ' hame at nicht , only ye maun jist lat her ken that ye 're there , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 13]: ay , '' said Marget , a little nonplussed in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 9]: `` Wad ye like to see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 9]: `` What ither did I come for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 13]: `` Weel , I s ' gang and luik for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 25]: He went to the back door , and called aloud : `` Annie , yer auntie 's here and wants to see ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 21]: `` She 'll be here in a minute , '' he said to Marget , as he re-entered the shop .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 35]: After a little more desultory conversation , he pretended to be surprised that she she did not make her appearance , and going once more to the door , called her name several times .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 29]: He then pretended to search for her in the garden and all over the house , and returned with the news that she was nowhere to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 25]: `` She 's feared that ye 're come to tak her wi ' ye , and she 's run awa oot aboot some gait .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 12]: I 'll sen ' the laddies to luik for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 9]: `` Na , na , never min ' .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 18]: Gin she disna want to see me , I 'm sure I needna want to see her .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 20]: I 'll awa doon the toon , '' said Margaret , her face growing very red as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 17]: She bustled out of the shop , too angry with Annie to say farewell to Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 25]: She had not gone far , however , before Annie came running out of a narrow close , almost into her aunt 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 9]: But there was no refuge for her there .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 6]: `` Ye little limmer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 17]: cried Margaret , seizing her by the shoulder , `` what gart ye rin awa ' ?
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 9]: I dinna want ye , ye brat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 10]: `` I didna rin awa ' , Auntie . ''
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 14]: `` Robert Bruce cried on ye to come in , himsel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 22]: `` It wis himsel ' that sent me to Laurie Lumley 's to tell him to come till him direckly . ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 12]: Margaret could not make `` head or tail '' of it .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 16]: But as Annie had never told her a lie , she could not doubt her .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 26]: So taking time to think about it , she gave her some rough advice and a smooth penny , and went away on her errands .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 39]: She was not long in coming to the conclusion that Bruce wanted to sunder her and the child ; and this offended her so much , that she did not go near the shop for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 12]: Thus Annie was forsaken , and Bruce had what he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 12]: He needed not have been so full of scheming , though .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 14]: Annie never said a word to her aunt about their treatment of her .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 20]: It is one of the marvels in the constitution of children , how much they will bear without complaining .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 29]: Parents and guardians have no right to suppose that all is well in the nursery or school-room , merely from the fact that the children do not complain .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 24]: Servants and tutors may be cruel , and children will be silent -- partly , I presume , because they forget so soon .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 43]: But vengeance of a sort soon overtook Robert Bruce the younger ; for the evil spirit in him , derived from no such remote ancestor as the king , would not allow him a long respite from evil-doing , even in school .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 34]: He knew Annie better than his father , that she was not likely to complain of anything , and that the only danger lay in the chance of being discovered in the deed .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 29]: One day when the master had left the room to confer with some visitor at the door , he spied Annie in the act of tying her shoe .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 40]: Perceiving , as he believed , at a glance , that Alec Forbes was totally unobservant , he gave her an ignominious push from behind , which threw her out on her face in the middle of the floor .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 44]: But Alec did catch sight of him in the very deed , was down upon him in a moment , and , having already proved that a box on the ear was of no lasting effect , gave him a downright good thrashing .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 32]: He howled vigorously , partly from pain , partly in the hope that the same consequences as before would overtake Forbes ; and therefore was still howling when Mr Malison re-entered .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 18]: `` Robert Bruce , come up , '' bawled he , the moment he opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 38]: And Robert Bruce went up , and notwithstanding his protestations , received a second , and far more painful punishment from the master , who , perhaps , had been put out of temper by his visitor .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 46]: But there is no good in speculating on that or any other possibility in the matter ; for , as far at least as the boys could see , the master had no fixed principle as to the party on whom the punishment should fall .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 12]: Punishment , in his eyes , was perhaps enough in itself .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 45]: If he was capable of seeing that _ punishment _ , as he called it , falling on the wrong person , was not _ punishment _ , but only _ suffering _ , certainly he had not seen the value of the distinction .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 15]: If Bruce howled before , he howled tenfold now , and went home howling .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 27]: Annie was sorry for him , and tried to say a word of comfort to him ; but he repelled her advances with hatred and blows .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 63]: As soon as he reached the shop he told his father that Forbes had beaten him without his having even spoken to him , which was as correct as it was untrue , and that the master had taken Forbes 's part , and _ licked _ him over again , of which latter assertion there was proof enough on his person .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 18]: Robert the elder was instantly filled with smouldering wrath , and from that moment hated Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 44]: For , like many others of low nature , he had yet some animal affection for his children , combined with an endless amount of partisanship on their behalf , which latter gave him a full right to the national motto of Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 21]: Indeed , for nothing in the world but money , would he have sacrificed what seemed to him their interests .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 42]: A man must learn to love his children , not because they are his , but because they are _ children _ , else his love will be scarcely a better thing at last than the party-spirit of the faithful politician .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 12]: I doubt if it will prove even so good a thing .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 13]: From this hatred to Alec Forbes came some small consequences at length .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 23]: But for the present it found no outlet save in sneers and prophetic hints of an `` ill hinner en ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 14]: In her inmost heart Annie dedicated herself to the service of Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 13]: Nor was it long before she had an opportunity of helping him .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 39]: One Saturday the master made his appearance in black instead of white stockings , which was regarded by the scholars as a bad omen ; and fully were their prognostications justified , on this occasion , at least .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 29]: The joy of the half-holiday for Scotch boys and girls has a terrible weight laid in the opposite scale -- I mean the other half of the day .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 27]: This weight , which brings the day pretty much on a level with all other days , consists in a free use of the Shorter Catechism .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 30]: This , of course , made them hate the Catechism , though I am not aware that that was of any great consequence , or much to be regretted .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 32]: For my part , I wish the spiritual engineers who constructed it had , after laying the grandest foundation-stone that truth could afford them , glorified God by going no further .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 19]: Certainly many a man would have enjoyed Him sooner , if it had not been for their work .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 11]: the Catechism was not enough , even of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 33]: The tormentors of youth had gone further , and provided what they called Scripture proofs of the various assertions of the Catechism ; a support of which it stood greatly in need .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 40]: I say , for the boys and girls who had to learn these proofs , called texts of Scripture , but too frequently only morsels torn bleeding and shapeless from `` the lovely form of the Virgin Truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 36]: For these tasks , combined with the pains and penalties which accompanied failure , taught them to dislike the Bible as well as the Catechism , and that was a matter of altogether different import .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 54]: Every Saturday , then , Murdoch Malison 's pupils had to learn so many questions of the Shorter Catechism , with proofs from Scripture ; and whoever failed in this task was condemmed to imprisonment for the remainder of the day , or , at least , till the task should be accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 33]: The imprisonment was sometimes commuted for chastisement -- or finished off with it , when it did not suit the convenience of the master to enforce the full term of a school-day .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 44]: Upon certain Saturdays , moreover , one in each month , I think , a repetition was required of all the questions and proofs that had been , or ought to have been , learned since the last observance of the same sort .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 62]: Now the day in question was one of these of accumulated labour , and Alec Forbes only succeeded in bringing proof of his inability for the task , and was in consequence condemned `` to be keepit in '' -- a trial hard enough for one whose chief delights were the open air and the active exertion of every bodily power .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 68]: Annie caught sight of his mortified countenance , the expression of which , though she had not heard his doom , so filled her with concern and indignation , that -- her eyes and thoughts fixed upon him , at the other end of the class -- she did not know when her turn came , but allowed the master to stand before her in bootless expectation .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 43]: He did not interrupt her , but with a refinement of cruelty that ought to have done him credit in his own eyes , waited till the universal silence had at length aroused Annie to self-consciousness and a sense of annihilating confusion .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 31]: Then , with a smile on his thin lips , but a lowering thunder-cloud on his brow , he repeated the question : `` What doth every sin deserve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 47]: Annie , bewildered , and burning with shame at finding herself the core of the silence -- feeling is if her poor little spirit stood there naked to the scoffs and jeers around -- could not recall a word of the answer given in the Catechism .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 34]: So , in her bewilderment , she fell back on her common sense and experience , which , she ought to have known , had nothing to do with the matter in hand .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 8]: `` What doth every sin deserve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 5]: again repeated the tyrant .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 14]: `` A lickin ' , '' whimpered Annie , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 62]: The master seemed much inclined to consider her condemned out of her own mouth , and give her a whipping at once ; for it argued more than ignorance to answer _ a whipping _ , instead of _ the wrath and curse of God _ , & c. , & c. , as plainly set down in the Scotch Targum .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 91]: But reflecting , perhaps , that she was a girl , and a little one , and that although it would be more gratification to him to whip her , it might be equal suffering to her to be _ kept in _ , he gave that side wave of his head which sealed the culprit 's doom , and Annie took her place among the condemned , with a flutter of joy at her heart that Alec Forbes would not be left without a servant to wait upon him .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 36]: A few more boys made up the unfortunate party , but they were all little ones , and so there was no companion for Forbes , who evidently felt the added degradation of being alone .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 36]: The hour arrived ; the school was dismissed ; the master strode out , locking the door behind him ; and the defaulters were left alone , to chew the bitter cud of ill-cooked Theology .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 8]: For some time a dreary silence reigned .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 18]: Alec sat with his elbows on his desk , biting his nails , and gnawing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 12]: Annie sat dividing her silent attention between her book and Alec .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 28]: The other boys were , or seemed to be , busy with their catechisms , in the hope of getting out as soon as the master returned .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 24]: At length Alec took out his knife , and began , for very vacancy , to whittle away at the desk before him .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 21]: When Annie saw that , she crept across to his form , and sat down on the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 15]: Alec looked up at her , smiled , and went on with his whittling .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 18]: Annie slid a little nearer to him , and asked him to hear her say her catechism .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 10]: He consented , and she repeated the lesson perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 13]: `` Now let me hear you , Alec , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 8]: `` Na , thank ye , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 20]: I canna say ` t. And I wonna say ' t for a ' the dominies in creation . ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 29]: `` But he 'll lick ye , Alec ; an ' I ` canna bide it , '' said Annie , the tears beginning to fill her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 26]: `` Weel , I 'll try -- to please you , Annie , '' said Alec , seeing that the little thing was in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 7]: How her heart bounded with delight !
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 19]: That great boy , so strong and so brave , trying to learn a lesson to please her !
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 6]: But it would not do .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 14]: `` I canna min ' a word o ' ` t , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 8]: I 'm dreidfu ' hungry , forbye .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 12]: I was in a hurry wi ' my brakfast the day .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 26]: Gin I had kent what was comin ' , I wad hae laid in a better stock , '' he added , laughing rather drearily .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 26]: As he spoke he looked up ; and his eyes wandered from one window to another for a few moments after he had ceased speaking .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 14]: `` Na ; it 's no use , '' he resumed at last .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 13]: `` I hae eaten ower muckle for that , ony gait . ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 16]: Annie was as pitiful over Alec 's hunger as any mother over her child 's .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 12]: She felt it pure injustice that he should ever be hungry .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 24]: But , unable to devise any help , she could only say , `` I dinna ken what ye mean , Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 53]: `` Whan I was na bigger than you , Annie , I could win oot at a less hole than that , '' answered he , and pointed to the open wooden pane in an upper corner of one the windows ; `` but I hae eaten ower muckle sin syne . ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 13]: And he laughed again ; but it was again an unsuccessful laugh .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 6]: Annie sprang to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 20]: `` Gin ye could win throu that hole ance , I can win throu ' t noo , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 7]: Jist haud me up a bit .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 11]: Ye _ can _ lift me , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 10]: And she looked up at him shyly and gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 16]: `` But what will ye do when ye _ are _ oot , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 14]: `` Rin hame , and fess a loaf wi ' me direckly . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 43]: `` But Rob Bruce 'll see yer heid atween yer feet afore he 'll gie ye a loaf , or a mou ` fu ' o ' cakes either ; an ' it 's ower far to rin to my mither 's .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 9]: Murdoch wad be back lang or that . ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 21]: `` Jist help me oot , an ' lea ' the lave to me , '' said Annie , confidently .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 22]: `` Gin I dinna fess a loaf o ' white breid , never lippen -LRB- trust -RRB- to me again . ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 37]: The idea of the bread , always a rarity and consequent delicacy to Scotch country boys , so early in the century as the date of my story , was too much for Alec 's imagination .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 18]: He jumped up , and put his head out of one of those open panes to reconnoitre .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 9]: He saw a woman approaching whom he knew .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 10]: `` I say , Lizzie , '' he called .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 4]: The woman stopped .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 10]: `` What 's yer wull , Maister Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 13]: `` Jist stan ' there an ' pu ' this lassie oot .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 14]: We 're a ' keepit in thegither , and nearhan ' hungert . ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 6]: `` The Lord preserve 's !
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 8]: I 'll gang for the key . ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 15]: `` Na , na ; _ we _ wad hae to pay for that .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 12]: Tak her oot -- that 's a ' we want . ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 13]: `` He 's a coorse crayter -- that maister o ' yours .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 9]: I wad gang to see him hangt . ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 18]: `` Bide a wee ; that 'll come in guid time , '' said Alec , pseudo-prophetically .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 40]: `` Weel I s ' hae a pu ' at the legs o ' him , to help him to jeedgement ; for he 'll be the deith o ' ane or twa o ' ye afore lang . ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 7]: `` Never min ' Murder Malison .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 9]: Will ye tak oot the bit lassie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 5]: `` Od will I !
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 5]: Whaur is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 17]: Alec jumped down and held her up to the open pane , not a foot square .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 10]: He told her to put her arms through first .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 34]: Then between them they got her head through , whereupon Lizzie caught hold of her -- so low was the school-room -- and dragged her out , and set her on her feet .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 11]: But alas , a window was broken in the process !
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 16]: `` Noo , Annie , '' cried Alec , `` never min ' the window .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 3]: Rin . ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 8]: She was off like a live bullet .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 9]: She scampered home prepared to encounter all dangers .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 23]: The worst of them all to her mind was the danger of not succeeding , and of so breaking faith with Alec .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 29]: She had sixpence of her own in coppers in her box , -- the only difficulty was to get into the house and out again without being seen .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 26]: By employing the utmost care and circumspection , she got in by the back or house door unperceived , and so up to her room .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 49]: In a moment more the six pennies were in her hand , and she in the street ; for she did not use the same amount of precaution in getting out again , not minding discovery so much now , if she could only have a fair start .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 7]: No one followed her , however .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 8]: She bolted into a baker 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 9]: `` A saxpenny-loaf , '' she panted out .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 6]: `` Wha wants it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 6]: asked the baker 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 16]: `` There 's the bawbees , '' answered Annie , laying them on the counter .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 44]: The baker 's wife gave her the loaf , with the biscuit which , from time immemorial , had always graced a purchase to the amount of sixpence ; and Annie sped back to the school like a runaway horse to his stable .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 12]: As she approached , out popped the head of Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 11]: He had been listening for the sound of her feet .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 30]: She held up the loaf as high as she could , and he stretched down as low as he could , and so their hands met on the loaf .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 12]: `` Thank ye , Annie , '' said Alec with earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 6]: `` I shanna forget this .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 7]: Hoo got ye ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 7]: `` Never ye min ' that .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 10]: I didna steal ` t , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 29]: `` But I maun win in again , '' she added , suddenly awaking to that difficult necessity , and looking up at the window above her head .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 8]: `` I 'm a predestined idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 19]: said Alec , with an impious allusion to the Shorter Catechism , as he scratched his helpless head .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 9]: `` I never thocht o ' that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 5]: It was clearly impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 24]: `` Ye 'll catch ` t , '' said one of the urchins to Annie , with his nose flattened against the window .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 17]: The roses of Annie 's face turned pale , but she answered stoutly , `` Weel !
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 17]: I care as little as the lave o ' ye , I 'm thinkin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 13]: By this time the `` idiot '' had made up his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 12]: He never could make up any other than a bull-headed mind .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 33]: `` Rin hame , Annie , '' he said ; `` and gin Murder offers to lay a finger o ' ye upo ' Monday , _ I 'll _ murder him .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 2]: Faith !
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 5]: I 'll kill him .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 13]: Rin hame afore he comes and catches ye at the window . ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 11]: `` No , no , Alec , '' pleaded Annie .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 17]: `` Haud yer tongue , '' interrupted Alec , `` and rin , will ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 60]: Seeing he was quite determined , Annie , though loath to leave him , and in terror of what was implied in the threats he uttered against the master and might be involved in the execution of them , obeyed him and walked leisurely home , avoiding the quarters in which there was a chance of meeting her gaoler .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 29]: She found that no one had observed her former visit ; the only remarks made being some _ goody _ ones about the disgrace of being kept in .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 18]: When Mr Malison returned to the school about four o'clock , he found all quiet as death .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 28]: The boys appeared totally absorbed in _ committing _ the Shorter Catechism , as if the Shorter Catechism was a sin , which perhaps it was not .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 23]: But , to his surprise , which he pretended to be considerably greater than it really was , the girl was absent .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 7]: `` Where is Ann Anderson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 9]: were the first words he condescended to utter .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 12]: `` Gane hame , '' cried two of the little prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 5]: `` Gone home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 40]: echoed the master in a tone of savage incredulity ; although not only was it plain that she was gone , but he must have known well enough , from former experience , how her escape had been effected .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' said Forbes ; `` it was me made her go .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 8]: I put her out at the window .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 30]: And I broke the window , '' he added , knowing that it must soon be found out , `` but I 'll get it mended on Monday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 11]: Malison turned as white as a sheet with venomous rage .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 16]: Indeed , the hopelessness of the situation had made Alec speak with too much nonchalance .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 29]: Anxious to curry favour , the third youngster now called out , `` Sandy Forbes gart her gang an ' fess a loaf o ' white breid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 29]: Of this bread , the wretched informer had still some of the crumbs sticking to his jacket -- so vitiating is the influence of a reign of terror .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 23]: The bread was eaten , and the giver might be betrayed in the hope of gaining a little favour with the tyrant .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 8]: `` Alexander Forbes , come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 11]: Beyond this point I will not here prosecute the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 21]: Alec bore his punishment with great firmness , although there were few beholders , and none of them worth considering .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 22]: After he had spent his wrath , the master allowed them all to depart without further reference to the Shorter Catechism .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 24]: The Sunday following was anything but a day of repose for Annie -- she looked with such frightful anticipation to the coming Monday .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 72]: Nor was the assurance with which Alec Forbes had sent her away , and which she was far from forgetting , by any means productive of unmingled consolation ; for , in a conflict with such a power of darkness as Mr Malison , how could Alec , even if sure to be victorious as any knight of old story , come off without injury terrible and not to be contemplated !
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 12]: Yet , strange to tell -- or was it really strange ?
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 83]: -- as she listened to the evening sermon , a sermon quietly and gently enforcing the fate of the ungodly , it was not with exultation at the tardy justice that would overtake such men as Murdock Malison or Robert Bruce , nor yet with pity for their fate , that she listened ; but with anxious heart-aching fear for her friend , the noble , the generous Alec Forbes , who withstood authority , and was therefore in danger of hell-fire .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 9]: About her own doom , speculation was uninteresting .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 5]: The awful morning dawned .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 44]: When she woke , and the thought of what she had to meet came back on her , though it could hardly be said to have been a moment absent all night long , she turned , not metaphorically , but physically sick .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 22]: Yet breakfast time would come , and worship did not fail to follow , and then to school she must go .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 10]: There all went on as usual for some time .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 31]: The Bible-class was called up , heard , and dismissed ; and Annie was beginning to hope that the whole affair was somehow or other wrapt up and laid by .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 36]: She had heard nothing of Alec 's fate after she had left him imprisoned , and except a certain stoniness in his look , which a single glance discovered , his face gave no sign .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 21]: She dared not lift her eyes from the spelling-book before her , to look in the direction of the master .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 26]: No murderer could have felt more keenly as if all the universe were one eye , and that eye fixed on him , than Annie .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 39]: Suddenly the awful voice resounded through the school , and the words it uttered -- though even after she heard them it seemed too terrible to be true -- were , `` Ann Anderson , come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 12]: For a moment she lost consciousness -- or at least memory .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 13]: When she recovered herself , she found herself standing before the master .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 16]: His voice seemed to have left two or three unanswered questions somewhere in her head .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 8]: What they were she had no idea .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 30]: But presently he spoke again , and , from the tone , what he said was evidently the repetition of a question -- probably put more than once before .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 18]: `` Did you , or did you not , go out at the window on Saturday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 23]: She did not see that Alec Forbes had left his seat , and was slowly lessening the distance between them and him .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' she answered , trembling from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 22]: `` Did you , or did you not , bring a loaf of bread to those who were kept in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 8]: `` Where did you get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 8]: `` I bought it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 9]: `` Where did you get the money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 20]: Of course every eye in the school was fixed upon her , those of her cousins sparkling with delight .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 14]: `` I got it oot o ' my ain kist , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 7]: `` Hold up your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 14]: Annie obeyed , with a most pathetic dumb terror pleading in her face .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 19]: `` Do n't touch her , '' said Alec Forbes , stepping between the executioner and his victim .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 11]: `` You know well enough it was all my fault .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 8]: I told you so on Saturday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 108]: Murder Malison , as the boys called him , turned with the tawse over his shoulder , whence it had been on the point of swooping upon Annie , and answered him with a hissing blow over his down-bent head , followed by a succession of furious blows upon every part of his person , as it twisted and writhed and doubled ; till , making no attempt at resistance , he was knocked down by the storm , and lay prostrate under the fierce lashes , the master holding him down with one foot , and laying on with the whole force of the opposite arm .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 37]: At length Malison stopped , exhausted , and turning , white with rage , towards Annie , who was almost in a fit with agony , repeated the order : `` Hold up your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 39]: But as he turned Alec bounded to his feet , his face glowing , and his eyes flashing , and getting round in front , sprang at the master 's throat , just as the tawse was descending .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 24]: Malison threw him off , and lifting his weapon once more , swept it with a stinging lash round his head and face .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 64]: Alec , feeling that this was no occasion on which to regard the rules of fair fight , stooped his head , and rushed , like a ram , or a negro , full tilt against the pit of Malison 's stomach , and doubling him up , sent him with a crash into the peat fire which was glowing on the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 22]: In the attempt to save himself , he thrust his hand right into it , and Alec and Annie were avenged .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 18]: Alec rushed to drag him off the fire ; but he was up before he reached him .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 5]: `` Go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 18]: he bawled to the scholars generally , and sat down at his desk to hide his suffering .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 8]: For one brief moment there was silence .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 36]: Then a tumult arose , a shouting , and holloing , and screeching , and the whole school rushed to the door , as if the devil had been after them to catch the hindmost .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 28]: Strange uproar invaded the ears of Glamerton -- strange , that is , at eleven o'clock in the forenoon of Monday -- the uproar of jubilant freedom .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 32]: But the culprits , Annie and Alec , stood and stared at the master , whose face was covered with one hand , while the other hung helpless at his side .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 16]: Annie stopped partly out of pity for the despot , and partly because Alec stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 21]: Alec stopped because he was the author of the situation -- at least he never could give any better reason .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 16]: At length Mr Malison lifted his head , and made a movement towards his hat .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 10]: He started when he saw the two standing there .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 12]: But the moment he looked at them their courage failed them .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 6]: `` Rin , Annie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 3]: said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 26]: Away she bolted , and he after her , as well as he could , which was not with his usual fleetness by any means .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 24]: When Annie had rounded a corner , not in the master 's way home , she stopped , and looked back for Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 20]: He was a good many paces behind her ; and then first she discovered the condition of her champion .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 35]: For now that the excitement was over , he could scarcely walk , and evidence in kind was not wanting that from head to foot he must be one mass of wales and bruises .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 62]: He put his hand on her shoulder to help him along , and made no opposition to her accompanying him as far as the gate of his mother 's garden , which was nearly a mile from the town , on the further bank of one of the rivers watering the valley-plain in which Glamerton had stood for hundreds of years .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 33]: Then she went slowly home , bearing with her the memory of the smile which , in spite of pain , had illuminated his tawse-waled cheeks , as she took her leave .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 7]: `` Good-bye , dear Alec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 4]: she had said .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 29]: `` Good-bye , Annie dear , '' he had answered , with the smile ; and she had watched him crawl into the house before she turned away .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 35]: When she got home , she saw at once , from the black looks of the Bruce , that the story , whether in its trite shape or not , had arrived before her .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 63]: Nothing was said , however , till after worship ; when Bruce gave her a long lecture , as impressive as the creature was capable of making it , on the wickedness and certain punishment of `` takin ' up wi ' ill loons like Sandy Forbes , wha was brakin ' his mither 's hert wi ' his baad behaviour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 84]: But he came to the conclusion , as he confided to his wife that night , that the lassie `` was growin ' hardent already ; '' probably from her being in a state of too great excitement from the events of the day to waste a tear upon his lecture ; for , as she said in the hearing of the rottans , when she went up to bed , she '' _ didna care a flee for ` t _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 17]: But the moment she lay down she fell to weeping bitterly over the sufferings of Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 10]: She was asleep in a moment after , however .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 35]: If it had not been for the power of sleeping that there was in the child , she must long before now have given way to the hostile influences around her , and died .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 28]: There was considerable excitement about the hearths of Glamerton , generally , in consequence of the news of the master 's defeat carried home by the children .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 76]: For , although it was amazing how little of the doings at school the children were in the habit of reporting -- so little , indeed , that this account involved revelations of the character and proceedings of Mr Malison which appeared to many of the parents quite incredible -- the present occurrence so far surpassed the ordinary , and had excited the beholders so much , that they could not be quiet about it .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 9]: Various were the judgments elicited by the story .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 55]: The religious portion of the community seemed to their children to side with the master ; the worldly -- namely , those who did not profess to be particularly religious -- all sided with Alec Forbes ; with the exception of a fish-cadger , who had one son , the plague of his life .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 32]: Amongst the religious , there was , at least , one exception , too ; but he had no children of his own , and had a fancy for Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 9]: That exception was Thomas Crann , the stone-mason .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 45]: Thomas Crann was building a house ; for he was both contractor -- in a small way , it is true , not undertaking to do anything without the advance of a good part of the estimate -- and day-labourer at his own job .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 32]: Having arrived at the point in the process where the assistance of a carpenter was necessary , he went to George Macwha , whom he found at his bench , planing .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 45]: This bench was in a work-shop , with two or three more benches in it , some deals set up against the wall , a couple of red cart-wheels sent in for repair , and the tools and materials of his trade all about .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 31]: The floor was covered with shavings , or _ spales _ , as they are called by northern consent , which a poor woman was busy gathering into a sack .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 80]: After a short and gruff greeting on the part of Crann , and a more cordial reply from Macwha , who ceased his labour to attend to his visitor , they entered on the business-question , which having been carefully and satisfactorily discussed , with the aid of various diagrams upon the half-planed deal , Macwha returned to his work , and the conversation took a more general scope , accompanied by the sounds of Macwha 's busy instrument .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 10]: `` A terrible laddie , that Sandy Forbes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 28]: said the carpenter , with a sort of laugh in the _ whishk _ of his plane , as he threw off a splendid _ spale _ .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 20]: `` They say he 's lickit the dominie , and ` maist been the deid o ' him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 17]: `` I hae kent waur laddies nor Sandy Forbes , '' was Thomas 's curt reply .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 6]: `` Ow , deed ay !
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 7]: I ken naething agen the laddie .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 10]: Him an ' oor Willie 's unco throng . ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 33]: To this the sole answer Thomas gave was a grunt , and a silence of a few seconds followed before he spoke , reverting to the point from which they had started .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 19]: `` I 'm no clear but Alec micht hae committed a waur sin than thrashin ' the dominie .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 20]: He 's a dour crater , that Murdoch Malison , wi ' his fair face and his picket words .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 14]: I doot the bairns hae the warst o ' ' t in general .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 8]: And for Alec I hae great houpes .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 8]: He comes o ' a guid stock .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 72]: His father , honest man , was ane o ' the Lord 's ain , although he didna mak ' sic a stan ' as , maybe , he ought to hae dune ; and gin his mither has been jist raither saft wi ' him , and gi'en him ower lang a tether , he 'll come a ' richt afore lang , for he 's worth luikin efter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 11]: `` I dinna richtly unnerstan ' ye , Thamas . ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 17]: `` I dinna think the Lord 'll tyne the grip o ' his father 's son .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 23]: He 's no convertit yet , but he 's weel worth convertin ' , for there 's guid stuff in him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 15]: Thomas did not consider how his common sense was running away with his theology .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 15]: But Macwha was not the man to bring him to book on that score .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 15]: His only reply lay in the careless _ whishk whashk _ of his plane .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 15]: Thomas resumed : `` He jist wants what ye want , Gleorge Macwha . ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 8]: `` What 's that , Thamas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 33]: asked George , with a grim attempt at a smile , as if to say : `` I know what 's coming , but I 'm not going to mind it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 17]: `` He jist wants to be weel shaken ower the mou ' o ' the pit .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 13]: He maun smell the brunstane o ' the everlastin ' burnin 's .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 44]: He 's nane o ' yer saft buirds , that ye can sleek wi ' a sweyp o ' yer airm ; he 's a blue whunstane that 's hard to dress , but , anes dressed , it bides the weather bonnie .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 10]: I like to work upo ' hard stane mysel .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 21]: Nane o ' yer saft freestane , ` at ye cud cut wi ' a k-nife , for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 12]: `` Weel , I daursay ye 're richt , Thamas . ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 45]: `` And , forbye , they say he took a ' his ain licks ohn said a word , and flew at the maister only whan he was gaein to lick the puir orphan lassie -- Jeames Anderson 's lassie , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 2]: ay .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 10]: It 's the same tale they a ' tell .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 9]: I hae nae doobt it 's correck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 16]: `` Weel , lat him tak it , than , an ' be thankfu ' !
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 16]: for it 's no more than was weel waured -LRB- spent -RRB- on him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 8]: With these conclusive words , Thomas departed .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 53]: He was no sooner out of the shop , than out started , from behind the deal boards that stood against the wall , Willie , the eldest hope of the house of Macwha , a dusky-skinned , black-eyed , curly-headed , roguish-looking boy , Alec Forbes 's companion and occasional accomplice .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 30]: He was more mischievous than Alec , and sometimes led him into unforeseen scrapes ; but whenever anything extensive had to be executed , Alec was always the leader .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 12]: `` What are ye hidin ' for , ye rascal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 4]: said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 10]: `` What mischeef hae ye been efter noo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 13]: `` Naething by ordinar ' , '' was Willie 's cool reply .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 9]: `` What garred ye hide , than ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 32]: `` Tam Crann never sets ee upo ' me , but he misca 's me , an ' I dinna like to be misca 'd , mair nor ither fowk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 16]: `` Ye get nae mair nor ye deserve , I doobt , '' returned George .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 17]: `` Here , tak the chisel , and cut that beadin ' into le n'ths . ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 19]: `` I 'm gaein ' ower the water to speir efter Alec , '' was the excusatory rejoinder .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 5]: `` Ay , ay !
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 4]: pot and pan !
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 7]: -- What ails Alec noo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 9]: `` Mr Malison 's nearhan ' killed him .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 11]: He hasna been at the schuil this twa days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 16]: With these words Willie bolted from the shop , and set off at full speed .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 10]: The latter part of his statement was perfectly true .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 23]: The day after the fight , Mr Malison came to the school as usual , but with his arm in a sling .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 12]: To Annie 's dismay , Alec did not make his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 57]: It had of course been impossible to conceal his corporal condition from his mother ; and the heart of the widow so yearned over the suffering of her son , though no confession of suffering escaped Alec 's lips , that she vowed in anger that he should never cross the door of that school again .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 42]: For three or four days she held immovably to her resolution , much to Alec 's annoyance , and to the consternation of Mr Malison , who feared that he had not only lost a pupil , but made an enemy .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 25]: For Mr Malison had every reason for being as smooth-faced with the parents as he always was : he had ulterior hopes in Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 47]: The clergyman was getting old , and Mr Malison was a licentiate of the Church ; and although the people had no direct voice in the filling of the pulpit , it was very desirable that a candidate should have none but friends in the parish .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 39]: Mr Malison made no allusion whatever to the events of Monday , and things went on as usual in the school , with just one exception : for a whole week the tawse did not make its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 54]: This was owing in part at least to the state of his hand ; but if he had ever wished to be freed from the necessity of using the lash , he might have derived hope from the fact that somehow or other the boys were during this week no worse than usual .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 20]: I do not pretend to explain the fact , and beg leave to refer it to occult meteorological influences .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 40]: As soon as school was over on that first day of Alec 's absence , Annie darted off on the road to Howglen , where he lived , and never dropped into a walk till she reached the garden-gate .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 16]: Fully conscious of the inferiority of her position , she went to the kitchen door .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 16]: The door was opened to her knock before she had recovered breath enough to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 127]: The servant , seeing a girl with a shabby dress , and a dirty bonnet , from underneath which hung disorderly masses of hair -- they would have _ glinted _ in the eye of the sun , but in the eye of the maid they looked only dusky and disreputable -- for Annie was not kept so tidy on the interest of her money as she had been at the farm -- the girl , I say , seeing this , and finding besides , as she thought , that Annie had nothing to say , took her for a beggar , and returning into the kitchen , brought her a piece of oat-cake , the common dole to the young mendicants of the time .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 38]: Annie 's face flushed crimson , but she said gently , having by this time got her runaway breath a little more under control , `` No , I thank ye ; I 'm no a beggar .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 12]: I only wanted to ken hoo Alec was the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 27]: `` Come in , '' said the girl , anxious to make some amends for her blunder , `` and I 'll tell the mistress . ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 65]: Annie would gladly have objected , contenting herself with the maid 's own account ; but she felt rather than understood that there would be something undignified in refusing to face Alec 's mother ; so she followed the maid into the kitchen , and sat down on the edge of a wooden chair , like a perching bird , till she should return .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 35]: `` Please , mem , here 's a lassie wantin ' to ken hoo Maister Alec is the day , '' said Mary , with the handle of the parlour door in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 31]: `` That must be little Annie Anderson , mamma , '' said Alec , who was lying on the sofa very comfortable , considering what he had to lie upon .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 14]: It may be guessed at once that Scotch was quite discouraged at home .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 51]: Alec had told his mother all about the affair ; and some of her friends from Glamerton , who likewise had sons at the school , had called and given their versions of the story , in which the prowess of Alec made more of than in his own account .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 73]: Indeed , all his fellow-scholars except the young Bruces , sung his praises aloud ; for , whatever the degree of their affection for Alec , every one of them hated the master -- a terrible thought for him , if he had been able to appreciate it ; but I do not believe he had any suspicion of the fact that he was the centre of converging thoughts of revengeful dislike .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 70]: So the mother was proud of her boy -- far prouder than she was willing for him to see : indeed , she put on the guise of the offended proprieties as much as she could in his presence , thus making Alec feel like a culprit in hers , which was more than she intended , or would have liked , could she have peeped into his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 18]: So she could not help feeling some interest in Annie , and some curiosity to see her .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 25]: She had known James Anderson , her father , and he had been her guest more than once when he had called upon business .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 25]: Everybody had liked him ; and this general approbation was owing to no lack of character , but to his genuine kindness of heart .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 31]: So Mrs Forbes was prejudiced in Annie 's favour -- but far more by her own recollections of the father , than by her son 's representations of the daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 13]: `` Tell her to come up , Mary , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 26]: So Annie , with all the disorganization of school about her , was shown , considerably to her discomfort , into Mrs Forbes 's dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 34]: There was nothing remarkable in the room ; but to Annie 's eyes it seemed magnificent , for carpet and curtains , sideboard and sofa , were luxuries altogether strange to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 25]: So she entered very timidly , and stood trembling and pale -- for she rarely blushed except when angry -- close to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 23]: But Alec scrambled from the sofa , and taking hold of her by both hands , pulled her up to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 8]: `` There she is , mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 39]: And Mrs Forbes , although her sense of the fitness of things was not gratified at seeing her son treat with such familiarity a girl so neglectedly attired , yet received her kindly and shook hands with her .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 9]: `` How do you do , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 44]: `` Quite well , I thank ye , mem , '' answered Annie , showing in her voice that she was owerawed by the grand lady , yet mistress enough of her manners not to forget a pretty modest courtesy as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 15]: `` What 's gaein ' on at the school the day , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 3]: asked Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 22]: `` Naething by ordidar , '' answered Annie , the sweetness of her tones contrasting with the roughness of the dialect .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 10]: `` The maister 's a hantle quaieter than usual .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 14]: I fancy he 's a ' the better behaved for 's brunt fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 7]: But , oh , Alec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 13]: And here the little maiden burst into a passionate fit of crying .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 27]: `` What 's the matter , Annie , '' said Mrs Forbes , as she drew her nearer , genuinely concerned at the child 's tears .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 20]: mem , ye didna see hoo the maister lickit him , or ye wad hae grutten yersel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 12]: Tears from some mysterious source sprang to Mrs Forbes 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 27]: But at the moment Mary opened the door , and said -- `` Here 's Maister Bruce , mem , wantin ' to see ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 10]: `` Tell him to walk up , Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 18]: no , no , mem ; dinna lat him come till I 'm out o ' this .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 13]: He 'll tak ' me wi ' him , '' cried Annie .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 6]: Mary stood waiting the result .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 19]: `` But you must go home , you know , Annie , '' said Mrs Forbes , kindly .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 15]: `` Ay , but no wi ' _ him _ , '' pleaded Annie .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 23]: From what Mrs Forbes knew of the manners and character of Bruce , she was not altogether surprised at Annie 's reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 23]: So , turning to the maid , she said -- `` Have you told Mr Bruce that Miss Anderson is here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 5]: `` Me tell him !
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 4]: No , mem .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 8]: What 's _ his _ business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 8]: `` Mary , you forget yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 11]: `` Weel , mem , I canna bide him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 33]: `` Hold your tongue , Mary , '' said her mistress , hardly able to restrain her own amusement , `` and take the child into my room till he is gone .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 11]: But perhaps he knows you are here , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 8]: `` He canna ken that , mem .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 12]: He jumps at things whiles , though , sharp eneuch . ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 5]: `` Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 5]: We shall see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 14]: So Mary led Annie away to the sanctuary of Mrs Forbes 's bed-room .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 12]: But the Bruce was not upon Annie 's track at all .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 9]: His visit wants a few words of explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 31]: Bruce 's father had been a faithful servant to Mr Forbes 's father , who held the same farm before his son , both having been what are called gentlemen-farmers .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 29]: The younger Bruce , being anxious to set up a shop , had , for his father 's sake , been assisted with money by the elder Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 22]: This money he had repaid before the death of the old man , who had never asked any interest for it .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 31]: More than a few years had not passed before Bruce , who had a wonderful capacity for petty business , was known to have accumulated some savings in the bank .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 65]: Now the younger Forbes , being considerably more enterprising than his father , had spent all his capital upon improvements -- draining , fencing , and such like -- when a younger brother , to whom he was greatly attached , applied to him for help in an emergency , and he had nothing of his own within his reach wherewith to aid him .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 42]: In this difficulty he bethought him of Bruce , to borrow from whom would not involve the exposure of the fact that he was in any embarrassment , however temporary -- an exposure very undesirable in a country town like Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 44]: After a thorough investigation of the solvency of Mr Forbes , and a proper delay for consideration besides , Bruce supplied him with a hundred pounds upon personal bond , at the usual rate of interest , for a certain term of years .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 18]: Mr Forbes died soon after , leaving his affairs in some embarrassment in consequence of his outlay .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 33]: Mrs Forbes had paid the interest of the debt now for two years ; but , as the rent of the farm was heavy , she found this additional trifle a burden .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 22]: She had good reason , however , to hope for better times , as the farm must soon increase its yield .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 40]: Mr Bruce , on his part , regarded the widow with somewhat jealous eyes , because he very much doubted whether , when the day arrived , she would be able to pay him the money she owed him .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 11]: That day was , however , not just at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 42]: It was this diversion of his resources , and not the moral necessity for a nest-egg , as he had represented the case to Margaret Anderson , which had urged him to show hospitality to Annie Anderson and her little fortune .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 19]: So neither was it anxiety for the welfare of Alec that induced him to call on Mrs Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 17]: Indeed if Malison had killed him outright , he would have been rather pleased than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 31]: But he was in the habit of reminding the widow of his existence by all occasional call , especially when the time approached for the half-yearly payment of the interest .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 33]: And now the report of Alec 's condition gave him a suitable pretext for looking in upon his debtor , without , as he thought , appearing too greedy after his money .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 12]: `` Weel , mem , hoo are ye the day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 11]: said he , as he entered , rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 10]: `` Quite well , thank you , Mr Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 5]: Take a seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 9]: `` An ' hoo 's Mr Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 19]: `` There he is to answer for himself , '' said Mrs Forbes , looking towards the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 14]: `` Hoo are ye , Mr Alec , efter a ' this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 7]: said Bruce , turning towards him .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 24]: `` Quite well , thank you , '' answered Alec , in a tone that did not altogether please either of the listeners .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 20]: `` I thocht ye had been raither sair , sir , '' returned Bruce , in an acid tone .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 17]: `` I 've got a wale or two , that 's all , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 14]: `` Weel , I houp it 'll be a lesson to ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 13]: `` To Mr Malison , you should have said , Mr Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 10]: I am perfectly satisfied , for my part . ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 38]: His mother was surprised to hear him speak like a grown man , as well as annoyed at his behaviour to Bruce , in whose power she feared they might one day find themselves to their cost .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 5]: But she said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 8]: Bruce , likewise , was rather nonplussed .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 8]: He grinned a smile and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 19]: `` I hear you have taken James Anderson 's daughter into your family now , Mr Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 7]: `` Ow , ay , mem .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 60]: There was nobody to luik efter the bit lassie ; sae , though I cud but ill affoord it , wi ' my ain sma ' faimily comin ' up , I was jist in a mainner obleeged to tak ' her , Jeames Anderson bein ' a cousin o ' my ain , ye ken , mem . ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 16]: `` Well , I am sure it was very kind of you and Mrs Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 8]: How does the child get on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 9]: `` Middlin ' , mem , middlin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 14]: She 's jist some ill for takin ' up wi ' loons . ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 13]: Here he glanced at Alec , with an expression of successful spite .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 9]: He certainly had the best of it now .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 47]: Alec was on the point of exclaiming `` That 's a lie , '' but he had prudence enough to restrain himself , perceiving that the contradiction would have a better chance with his mother if he delayed its utterance till after the departure of Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 10]: So , meantime , the subject was not pursued .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 43]: A little desultory conversation followed , and the visitor departed , with a laugh from between his teeth as he took leave of Alec , which I can only describe as embodying an _ I told you so _ sort of satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 20]: Almost as soon as he was out of the house the parlour-door opened , and Mary brought in Annie .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 29]: Mrs Forbes 's eyes were instantly fixed on her with mild astonishment , and something of a mother 's tenderness awoke in her heart towards the little maid-child .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 11]: What would she not have given for such a daughter !
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 13]: During Bruce 's call , Mary had been busy with the child .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 43]: She had combed and brushed her thick brown hair , and , taken with its exceeding beauty , had ventured on a stroke of originality no one would have expected of her : she had left it hanging loose on her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 12]: Any one would think such an impropriety impossible to a Scotchwoman .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 22]: But then she had been handling the hair , and contact with anything alters so much one 's theories about it .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 24]: If Mary had found it so , instead of making it so , she would have said it was `` no dacent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 21]: But the hair gave her its own theory before she had done with it , and this was the result .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 34]: She had also washed her face and hands and neck , made the best she could of her poor , dingy dress , and put one of her own Sunday collars upon her .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 21]: Annie had submitted to it all without question ; and thus adorned , Mary introduced her again to the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 54]: Before Mrs Forbes had time to discover that she was shocked , she was captivated by the pale , patient face , and the longing blue eyes , that looked at her as if the child felt that she ought to have been her mother , but somehow they had missed each other .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 35]: They gazed out of the shadows of the mass of dark brown wavy hair that fell to her waist , and there was no more any need for Alec to contradict Bruce 's calumny .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 31]: But Mrs Forbes was speedily recalled to a sense of propriety by observing that Alec too was staring at Annie with a mingling of amusement , admiration , and respect .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 10]: `` What have you been about , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 10]: she said , in a tone of attempted reproof .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 11]: `` You have made a perfect fright of the child .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 5]: Take her away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 27]: When Annie was once more brought back , with her hair restored to its net , silent tears of mortification were still flowing down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 17]: -- When Annie cried , the tears always rose and flowed without any sound or convulsion .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 6]: Rarely did she sob even .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 11]: -- This completed the conquest of Mrs Forbes 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 33]: She drew the little one to her , and kissed her , and Annie 's tears instantly ceased to rise , while Mrs Forbes wiped away those still lingering on her face .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 68]: Mary then went to get the tea , and Mrs Forbes having left the room for a moment to recover that self-possession , the loss of which is peculiarly objectionable to a Scotchwoman , Annie was left seated on a footstool before the bright fire , the shadows from which were now dancing about the darkening room , and Alec lay on the sofa looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 27]: There was no great occasion for his lying on the sofa , but his mother desired it , and Alec had at present no particular objection .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 23]: `` I wadna like to be gran ' fowk , '' mused Annie aloud , for getting that she was not alone .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 14]: `` We 're no gran ' fowk , Annie , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 11]: `` Ay are ye , '' returned Annie , persistently .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 11]: `` Weel , what for wadna ye like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 12]: `` Ye maun be aye feared for blaudin ' things . ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 14]: `` Mamma wad tell ye a different story , '' rejoined Alec laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 12]: `` There 's naething here to blaud -LRB- spoil -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 4]: Mrs Forbes returned .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 5]: Tea was brought in .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 22]: Annie comported herself like a lady , and , after tea , ran home with mingled feelings of pleasure and pain .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 55]: For , notwithstanding her assertion that she would not like to be `` gran ' fowk , '' the kitchen fire , small and dull , the smelling shop , and her own dreary garret-room , did not seem more desirable from her peep into the warmth and comfort of the house at Howglen .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 35]: Questioned as to what had delayed her return from school , she told the truth ; that she had gone to ask after Alec Forbes , and that they had kept her to tea .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 12]: `` I tauld them that ye ran efter the loons ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 4]: said Bruce triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 50]: Then stung with the reflection that _ he _ had not been asked to stay to tea , he added : `` It 's no for the likes o ' you , Annie , to gang to gentlefowk 's hooses , makin ' free whaur ye 're no wantit .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 10]: Sae dinna lat me hear the like again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 21]: But it was wonderful how Bruce 's influence over Annie , an influence of distress , was growing gradually weaker .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 29]: He could make her uncomfortable enough ; but as to his opinion of her , she had almost reached the point of not caring a straw for that .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 23]: And she had faith enough in Alec to hope that he would defend her from whatever Bruce might have said against her .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 84]: Whether Mary had been talking in the town , as is not improbable , about little Annie Anderson 's visit to her mistress , and so the story of the hair came to be known , or not , I can not tell ; but it was a notable coincidence that a few days after , Mrs Bruce came to the back-door , with a great pair of shears in her hand , and calling Annie , said : `` Here , Annie !
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 6]: Yer hair 's ower lang .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 6]: I maun jist clip it .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 8]: It 's giein ye sair een . ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 16]: `` There 's naething the maitter wi ' my een , '' said Annie gently .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 5]: `` Dinna answer back .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 14]: Sit doon , '' returned Mrs Bruce , leading her into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 38]: Annie cared very little for her hair , and well enough remembered that Mrs Forbes had said it made a fright of her ; so it was with no great reluctance that she submitted to the operation .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 9]: Mrs Bruce chopped it short off all round .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 63]: As , however , this permitted what there was of it to fall about her face , there being too little to confine in the usual prison of the net , her appearance did not bear such marks of deprivation , or , in other and Scotch words , `` she didna luik sae dockit , '' as might have been expected .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 26]: Her wavy locks of rich brown were borne that night , by the careful hand of Mrs Bruce , to Rob Guddle , the barber .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 14]: Nor was the hand less careful that brought back their equivalent in money .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 22]: With a smile to her husband , half loving and half cunning , Mrs Bruce dropped the amount into the till .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 39]: Although Alec Forbes was not a boy of quick receptivity as far as books were concerned , and therefore was no favourite with Mr Malison , he was not by any means a common or a stupid boy .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 34]: His own eyes could teach him more than books could , for he had a very quick observation of things about him , both in what is commonly called nature and in humanity .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 15]: He knew all the birds , all their habits , and all their eggs .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 22]: Not a boy in Glamerton could find a nest quicker than he , or when found treated it with such respect .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 16]: For he never took young birds , and seldom more than half of the eggs .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 33]: Indeed he was rather an uncommon boy , having , along with more than the usual amount of activity even for a boy , a tenderness of heart altogether rare in boys .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 19]: He was as familiar with the domestic animals and their ways of feeling and acting as Annie herself .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 20]: Anything like cruelty he detested ; and yet , as occasion will show , he could execute stern justice .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 13]: With the world of men around him , he was equally conversant .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 36]: He knew the characters of the simple people wonderfully well ; and _ took to _ Thomas Crann more than to any one else , notwithstanding that Thomas would read him a long lecture sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 35]: To these lectures Alec would listen seriously enough , believing Thomas to be right ; though he could never make up his mind to give any after attention to what he required of him .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 37]: The first time Alec met Thomas after the affair with the dominie , was on the day before he was to go back to school ; for his mother had yielded at last to his entreaties .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 36]: Thomas was building an addition to a water-mill on the banks of the Glamour not far from where Alec lived , and Alec had strolled along thither to see how the structure was going on .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 29]: He expected a sharp rebuke for his behaviour to Mr Malison , but somehow he was not afraid of Thomas , and was resolved to face it out .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 31]: The first words Thomas uttered , however , were : `` Weel , Alec , can ye tell me what was the name o ' King Dawvid 's mither ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 11]: `` I can_not _ , Thomas , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 6]: `` What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 7]: `` Fin ' ye that oot .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 5]: Turn ower yer Bible .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 10]: Hae ye been back to the school yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 7]: I 'm gaein the morn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 18]: `` Ye 're no gaein to strive wi ' the maister afore nicht , are ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 9]: `` I dinna ken , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 9]: `` Maybe he 'll strive wi ' me .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 31]: -- But ye ken , Thomas , '' he continued , defending himself from what he supposed Thomas was thinking , `` King Dawvid himsel ' killed the giant . ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 6]: ay ; a ' richt .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 8]: I 'm no referrin ' to that .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 6]: Maybe ye did verra richt .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 47]: But tak care , Alec -- '' here Thomas paused from his work , and turning towards the boy with a trowelful of mortar in his hand , spoke very slowly and solemnly -- `` tak ye care that ye beir no malice against the maister .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 22]: Justice itsel , '' dune for the sake o ' a private grudge , will bunce back upo ' the doer .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 34]: I hae little doobt the maister 'll be the better for ` t ; but gin ye be the waur , it 'll be an ill job , Alec , my man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 11]: `` I hae no ill-will at him , Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 16]: `` Weel , jist watch yer ain hert , and bewaur ye o ' that .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 16]: I wad coonsel ye to try and please him a grainie mair nor ordinar ' .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 29]: It 's no that easy to the carnal man , but ye ken we ought to crucify the auld man , wi ' his affections and lusts . ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 23]: `` Weel , I 'll try , '' said Alec , to whom it was not nearly so difficult as Thomas imagined .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 11]: His _ man _ apparently was not very old yet .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 37]: And he did try ; and the master seemed to appreciate his endeavours , and to accept them as a peace-offering , thus showing that he really was the better for the punishment he had received .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 19]: It would be great injustice to Mr Malison to judge him by the feeling of the present day .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 64]: It was the custom of the time and of the country to use the tawse unsparingly ; for _ law _ having been , and still , in a great measure , being , the highest idea generated of the divine by the ordinary Scotch mind , it must be supported , at all risks even , by means of the leather strap .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 85]: In the hands of a wise and even-tempered man , no harm could result from the use of this instrument of justice ; but in the hands of a fierce-tempered and therefore changeable man , of small moral stature , and liable to prejudices and offence , it became the means of unspeakable injury to those under his care ; not the least of which was the production , in delicate natures , of doubt and hesitancy , sometimes deepening into cowardice and lying .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 31]: Mr Malison had nothing of the childlike in himself , and consequently never saw the mind of the child whose person he was assailing with a battery of excruciating blows .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 29]: A _ man _ ought to be able to endure grief suffering wrongfully , and be none the worse ; but who dares demand that of a child ?
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 40]: Well it is for such masters that even they are judged by the heart of a father , and not by the law of a king , that worst of all the fictions of an ignorant and low theology .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 28]: And if they must receive punishment , at least it will not be the heartless punishment which they inflicted on the boys and girls under their law .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 51]: Annie began to be regarded as a protegee of Alec Forbes , and as Alec was a favourite with most of his schoolfellows , and was feared where he was not loved , even her cousins began to look upon her with something like respect , and mitigate their persecutions .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 32]: But she did not therefore become much more reconciled to her position ; for the habits and customs of her home were distasteful to her , and its whole atmosphere uncongenial .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 29]: Nor could it have been otherwise in any house where the entire anxiety was , first , to make money , and next , not to spend it .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 15]: The heads did not in the least know that they were unkind to her .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 55]: On the contrary , Bruce thought himself a pattern of generosity if he gave her a scrap of string ; and Mrs Bruce , when she said to inquiring gossips `` The bairn 's like ither bairns -- she 's weel eneuch , '' thought herself a pattern of justice or even of forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 69]: But both were jealous of her , in relation to their own children ; and when Mrs Forbes sent for her one Saturday , soon after her first visit , they hardly concealed their annoyance at the preference shown her by one who was under such great obligation to the parents of other children every way superior to her whose very presence somehow or other made them uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 26]: The winter drew on -- a season as different from the summer in those northern latitudes , as if it belonged to another solar system .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 25]: Cold and stormy , it is yet full of delight for all beings that can either romp , sleep , or think it through .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 18]: But alas for the old and sickly , in poor homes , with scanty food and firing !
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 36]: Little children suffer too , though the gift of forgetfulness does for them what the gift of faith does for their parents -- helps them over many troubles , besides tingling fingers and stony feet .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 56]: There would be many tracks of those small feet in the morning snow , leading away across the fresh-fallen clouds from the house and cottage doors ; for the barbarity of _ morning-school _ , that is , an hour and a half of dreary lessons before breakfast , was in full operation at Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 4]: The winter came .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 16]: One morning , all the children awoke , and saw a white world around them .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 8]: Alec jumped out of bed in delight .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 8]: It was a sunny , frosty morning .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 26]: The snow had fallen all night , with its own silence , and no wind had interfered with the gracious alighting of the feathery water .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 28]: Every branch , every twig , was laden with its sparkling burden of down-flickered flakes , and threw long lovely shadows on the smooth featureless dazzle below .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 22]: Away , away , stretched the outspread glory , the only darkness in it being the line of the winding river .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 23]: All the snow that fell on it vanished , as death and hell shall one day vanish in the fire of God .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 11]: It flowed on , black through its banks of white .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 75]: Away again stretched the shine to the town , where every roof had the sheet that was let down from heaven spread over it , and the streets lay a foot deep in yet unsullied snow , soon , like the story of the ages , to be trampled , soiled , wrought , and driven with human feet , till , at last , God 's strong sun would wipe it all away .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 21]: From the door opening into this fairy-land , Alec sprang into the untrodden space , as into a new America .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 16]: He had discovered a world , without even the print of human foot upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 34]: The keen air made him happy ; and the face of nature , looking as peaceful as the face of a dead man dreaming of heaven , wrought in him jubilation and leaping .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 18]: He was at the school door before a human being had appeared in the streets of Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 22]: Its dwellers all lay still under those sheets of snow , which seemed to hold them asleep in its cold enchantment .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 31]: Before any of his fellows made their appearance , he had kneaded and piled a great heap of snowballs , and stood by his pyramid , prepared for the offensive .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 20]: He attacked the first that came , and soon there was a troop of boys pelting away at him .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 37]: But with his store of balls at his foot , he was able to pay pretty fairly for what he received ; till , that being exhausted , he was forced to yield the unequal combat .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 41]: By-and-by the little ones gathered , with Annie amongst them ; but they kept aloof , for fear of the flying balls , for the boys had divided into two equal parties , and were pelting away at each other .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 45]: At length the woman who had charge of the school-room , having finished lighting the fire , opened the door , and Annie , who was very cold , made a run for it , during a lull in the fury of the battle .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 32]: `` Stop , '' cried Alec ; and the balling ceased , that Annie , followed by a few others , might pass in safety through the midst of the combatants .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 17]: One boy , however , just as Annie was entering , threw a ball after her .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 30]: He missed her , but Alec did not miss him ; for scarcely was the ball out of his hand when he received another , right between his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 10]: Over he went , amidst a shout of satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 34]: When the master appeared at the top of the lane the fight came to a close ; and as he entered the school , the group round the fire broke up and dispersed .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 39]: Alec , having entered close behind the master , overtook Annie as she went to her seat , for he had observed , as she ran into the school , that she was lame -- indeed limping considerably .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 12]: `` What 's the maitter wi ' ye , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 7]: `` What gars ye hirple ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 9]: `` Juno bitet me , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 4]: Verra weel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 14]: returned Alec , in a tone that had more meaning than the words .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 38]: Soon after the Bible-class was over , and they had all taken their seats , a strange quiet stir and excitement gradually arose , like the first motions of a whirlpool at the turn of the tide .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 30]: The master became aware of more than the usual flitting to and fro amongst the boys , just like the coming and going which preludes the swarming of bees .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 17]: But as he had little or no constructive power , he never saw beyond the symptoms .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 12]: They were to him mere isolated facts , signifying present disorder .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 13]: `` John Morison , go to your seat , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 3]: John went .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 10]: `` Robert Rennie , go to your seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 3]: Robert went .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 38]: And this continued till , six having been thus passed by , and a seventh appearing three forms from his own , the master , who seldom stood it so long , could stand it no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 27]: The _ tag _ was thrown , and a _ licking _ followed , making matters a little better from the master 's point of view .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 19]: Now I will try to give , from the scholars ' side , a peep of what passed .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 43]: As soon as he was fairly seated , Alec said in a low voice across the double desk to one of the boys opposite , calling him by his nickname , `` I say , Divot , do ye ken Juno ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 5]: `` Maybe no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 3]: answered Divot .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 12]: `` But gin I dinna , my left leg dis . ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 14]: `` I thocht ye kent the shape o ' her teeth , man .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 12]: Jist gie Scrumpie there a dig i ' the ribs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 8]: `` What are ye efter , Divot ?
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 15]: I 'll gie ye a cloot o ' the lug , '' growled Scrumpie .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 4]: `` Hoot man !
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 6]: The General wants ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 9]: _ The General _ was Alec 's nickname .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 9]: `` What is ` t , General ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 7]: `` Do ye ken Juno ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 5]: `` Hang the bitch !
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 6]: I ken her ower weel .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 19]: She took her denner aff o ' ane o ' my hips , ae day last year . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 15]: `` Jist creep ower to Cadger there , and speir gin he kens Juno .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 7]: Maybe he 's forgotten her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 37]: Cadger 's reply was interrupted by the interference of the master , but a pantomimic gesture conveyed to the General sufficient assurance of the retentiveness of Cadger 's memory in regard to Juno and her favours .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 19]: Such messages and replies , notwithstanding more than one licking , kept passing the whole of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 15]: Now Juno was an animal of the dog kind , belonging to Robert Brace .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 28]: She had the nose and the legs of a bull-dog , but was not by any means thorough-bred , and her behaviour was worse than her breed .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 26]: She was a great favourite with her master , who ostensibly kept her chained in his back-yard for the protection of his house and property .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 13]: But she was not by any means popular with the rising generation .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 31]: For she was given to biting , with or without provocation , and every now and then she got loose -- upon sundry of which occasions she had bitten boys .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 35]: Complaint had been made to her owner , but without avail ; for he only professed great concern , and promised she should not get loose again , which promise had been repeatedly broken .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 11]: Various vows of vengeance had been made , and forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 31]: But now Alec Forbes had taken up the cause of humanity and justice : for the brute had bitten Annie , and _ she _ could have given no provocation .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 31]: It was soon understood throughout the school that war was to be made upon Juno , and that every able-bodied boy must be ready when called out by the General .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 45]: The minute they were dismissed , which , at this season of the year , took place at three o'clock , no interval being given for dinner , because there was hardly any afternoon , the boys gathered in a knot at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 12]: `` What are ye gaein ' to do , General ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 3]: asked one .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 8]: `` Kill her , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 5]: `` What way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 18]: `` Stane her to death , loons , like the man ` at brak the Sabbath . ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 9]: `` Broken banes for broken skins -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 3]: Ay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 12]: `` The damned ill-faured brute , to bite Annie Anderson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 20]: `` But there 's nae stanes to be gotten i ' the snaw , General , '' said Cadger .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 4]: `` Ye gomeril !
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 24]: Ye 'll get mair stanes nor ye 'll carry , I doobt , up o ' the side o ' the toll-road yonner .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 5]: Naething like road-metal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 26]: A confused chorus of suggestions and exclamations now arose , in the midst of which Willie Macwha , whose cognomen was Curly-pow , came up .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 10]: He was not often the last in a conspiracy .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 10]: His arrival had for the moment a sedative effect .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 5]: `` Here 's Curly !
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 5]: Here 's Curly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 11]: `` Weel , is ' t a ' sattled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 3]: asked he .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 14]: `` She 's condemned , but no execute yet , '' said Grumpie .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 10]: `` Hoo are we to win at her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 3]: asked Cadger .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 11]: `` That 's jist the pint , '' said Divot .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 15]: `` We canna weel kill her in her ain yard , '' suggested Houghie .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 3]: `` Na .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 21]: We maun bide our time , an ' tak her when she 's oot aboot , '' said the General .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 8]: `` But wha 's to ken that ?
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 9]: an ' hoo are we to gather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 16]: asked Cadger , who seemed both of a practical and a despondent turn of mind .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 18]: `` Noo , jist haud yer tongues , an ' hearken to me , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 7]: The excited assembly was instantly silent .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 19]: `` The first thing , '' began Alec , `` is to store plenty o ' ammunition . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 8]: `` Ay , ay , General . ''
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 5]: `` Haud yer tongues .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 12]: -- Whaur had we best stow the stanes , Curly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 5]: `` In oor yard .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 8]: They 'll never be noticed there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 5]: `` That 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 34]: Some time the nicht , ye 'll a ' carry what stanes ye can get -- an ' min ' they 're o ' a serviceable natur ' -- to Curly 's yard .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 10]: He 'll be o ' the ootluik for ye .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 20]: An , ' I say , Curly , doesna your riggin-stane owerluik the maist o ' the toon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 6]: `` Ay , General . ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 14]: `` Ye can see our hoose frae ` t -- canna ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 4]: `` Ay . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 12]: `` Weel , ye jist buy a twa three blue lichts .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 6]: Hae ye ony bawbees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 7]: `` Deil ane , General . ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 19]: `` Hae than , there 's fower an ' a bawbee for expenses o ' the war . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 7]: `` Thank ye , General . ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 12]: `` Ye hae an auld gun , haena ' ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 15]: `` Ay have I ; but she 's nearhan ' the rivin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 13]: `` Load her to the mou ' , and lat her rive .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 8]: We 'll may be hear ` t .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 8]: But haud weel oot ower frae her .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 10]: Ye can lay a train , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 13]: `` I s ' tak care o ' that , General . ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 14]: `` Scrumpie , ye bide no that far frae the draigon 's den .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 42]: Ye jist keep yer ee -- nae the crookit ane -- upo ' her ootgoins an ' incomins ; or raither , ye luik efter her comin oot , an ' we 'll a ' luik efter her gaein in again .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 21]: Jist mak a regiment o ' yer ain to watch her , and bring ye word o ' her proceedins .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 21]: Ye can easy luik roun the neuk o ' the back-yett , an ' nobody be a hair the wiser .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 21]: As sune as ever ye spy her lowse i ' the yard be aff wi ' ye to Willie Macwha .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 44]: Syne , Curly , ye fire yer gun , and burn the blue lichts o ' the tap o ' the hoose ; and gin I see or hear the signal , I 'll be ower in seven minutes an ' a half .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 26]: Ilka ane o ' ye ` at hears , maun luik efter the neist ; and sae we 'll a ' gether at Curly 's .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 14]: Fess yer bags for the stanes , them ` at has bags . ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 19]: `` But gin ye dinna see or hear , for it 's a lang road , General ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 3]: interposed Cadger .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 25]: `` Gin I 'm no at your yard , Curly , in saiven minutes an ' a half , sen ' Linkum efter me .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 13]: He 's the only ane o ' ye ` at can rin .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 16]: It 's a ' that he can do , but he does ' t weel .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 17]: -- Whan Juno 's ance oot , she 's no in a hurry in again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 41]: The boys separated and went home in a state of excitement , which probably , however , interfered very little with their appetites , seeing it was moderated in the mean time by the need and anticipation of their dinners .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 20]: The sun set now between two and three o'clock , and there were long forenights to favour the plot .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 36]: Perhaps their hatred of the dog would not have driven them to such extreme measures , even although she had bitten Annie Anderson , had her master been a favourite , or even generally respected .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 22]: But Alec knew well enough that the townsfolk were not likely to sympathize with Bruce on the ill-treatment of his cur .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 34]: When the dinner and the blazing fire had filled him so full of comfort that he was once more ready to encounter the cold , Alec could stay in the house no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 9]: `` Where are you going , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 8]: `` Into the garden , mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 14]: `` What can you want in the garden -- full of snow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 11]: `` It 's just the snow I want , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 6]: It wo n't keep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 40]: And , in another moment , he was under the clear blue night-heaven , with the keen frosty air blowing on his warm cheek , busy with a wheelbarrow and a spade , slicing and shovelling in the snow .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 39]: He was building a hut of it , after the fashion of the Esquimaux hut , with a very thick circular wall , which began to lean towards its own centre as soon as it began to rise .

WARNING: Untokenizable: � (U+FFFD, decimal: 65533)
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 59]: This hut he had pitched at the foot of a flag-staff on the green - _ lawn _ would be too grand a word for the hundred square feet in front of his mother 's house , though the grass which lay beneath the snowy carpet was very green and lovely grass , smooth enough for any lawn .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 53]: In summer Alec had quite revelled in its greenness and softness , as he lay on it reading the _ Arabian Nights _ and the Ettrick Shepherd 's stories : now it was `` white with the whiteness of what is dead ; '' for is not the snow just dead water ?
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 53]: The flag-staff he had got George Macwha to erect for him , at a very small outlay ; and he had himself fitted it with shrouds and a cross-yard , and signal halliards ; for he had always a fancy for the sea , and boats , and rigging of all sorts .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 34]: And he had a great red flag , too , which he used to hoist on special occasions - on market-days and such like ; and often besides when a good wind blew .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 16]: And very grand it looked , as it floated in the tide of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 41]: Often he paused in his work , and turned - and oftener without raising himself he glanced towards the town ; but no signal burned from the ridge of Curly 's house , and he went on with his labour .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 19]: When called in to tea , he gave a long wistful look townwards , but saw no sign .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 43]: Out again he went , but no blue fire rejoiced him that night with the news that Juno was ranging the streets ; and he was forced to go to bed at last , and take refuge from his disappointment in sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 29]: The next day he strictly questioned all his officers as to the manner in which they had fulfilled their duty , and found no just cause of complaint .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 61]: `` In future , '' he said to Curly , with the importance of one who had the affairs of boys and dogs upon his brain - so that his style rose into English - `` in future , Curly , you may always know I am at home when you see the red flag flying from my flag-staff . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 17]: `` That 's o ' sma ' service , General , i ' the lang forenichts .

Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 18]: Do ye think fowk wash their flags afore they hing them oot , like sarks or sheets ?
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 12]: Dinna ye be ower clever , Curly , my man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 5]: Whereupon Curly shut up .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 14]: ****** `` What are you in such a state about , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 4]: asked his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 18]: `` Nothing very particular , mamma , '' answered Alec , ashamed of his want of self-command .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 19]: `` You 've looked out at the window twenty times in the last half-hour , '' she persisted .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 21]: `` Curly promised to burn a blue light , and I wanted to see if I could see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 14]: Suspecting more , his mother was forced to be content with this answer .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 11]: But that night was also passed without sight or sound .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 21]: Juno kept safe in her barrel , little thinking of the machinations against her in the wide snow-covered country around .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 29]: Alec finished the Esquimaux hut , and the snow falling all night , the hut looked the next morning as if it had been there all the winter .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 57]: As it seemed likely that a long spell of white weather had set in , Alec resolved to extend his original plan , and carry a long snow passage , or covered vault , from the lattice-window of a small closet , almost on a level with the ground , to this retreat by the flag-staff .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 30]: He was hard at work in the execution of this project , on the third night , or rather late afternoon : they called it _ forenight _ there .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 15]: `` What can that be , mem , awa ower the toon there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 28]: said Mary to her mistress , as in passing she peeped out of the window , the blind of which Alec had drawn up behind the curtain .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 8]: `` What is it , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 11]: `` That 's jist what I dinna ken , mem .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 12]: It canna be the rory-bories , as Alec ca 's them .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 5]: It 's ower blue .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 5]: -- It 's oot .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 6]: -- It 's in agin .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 6]: -- It 's no canny .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 7]: -- And , preserves a ' !
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 22]: it 's crackin ' as weel , '' cried Mary , as the subdued sound of a far-off explosion reached her .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 34]: This was of course no other than the roar of Curly 's gun in the act of bursting and vanishing ; for neither stock , lock , nor barrel was ever seen again .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 12]: It left the world like a Norse king on his fire-ship .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 23]: But , at the moment , Alec was too busy in the depths of his snow-vault to hear or see the signals .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 15]: By-and-by a knock came to the kitchen door , Mary went and opened it .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 24]: `` Alec 's at hame , I ken , '' said a rosy boy , almost breathless with past speed and present excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 10]: `` Hoo ken ye that , my man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 4]: asked Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 7]: 'Cause the flag 's fleein ' .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 5]: Whaur is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 21]: `` Gin ye ken sae muckle aboot him already , ye can jist fin ' him to yersel ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 7]: `` The bick 's oot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 3]: panted Linkum .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 6]: But Mary shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 7]: `` Here 's a job ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 5]: said Linkum to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 9]: `` I canna gang throu a steekit door .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 14]: And there 's Juno wi ' the rin o ' the haill toun .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 5]: Deil tak her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 20]: But at the moment he heard Alec whistling a favourite tune , as he shovelled away at the snow .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 4]: `` General ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 6]: cried Linkum , in ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 20]: answered Alec , flinging his spade twenty feet from him , and bolting in the direction of the call .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 9]: `` Is ' t you , Linkum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 8]: `` She 's oot , General . ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 18]: `` Deil hae her , gin ever she wins in again , the curst worryin ' brute !
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 7]: Did ye gang to Curly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 5]: `` Ay did I .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 31]: He fired the gun , and brunt three blue lichts , and waited seven minutes and a half ; and syne he sent me for ye , General . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 40]: _ Con_foon ' ` t , '' cried Alec , and tore through shrubbery and hedge , the nearest way to the road , followed by Linkum , who even at full speed was not a match for Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 49]: Away they flew like the wind , along the well-beaten path to the town , over the footbridge that crossed the Glamour , and full speed up the hill to Willie Macwha , who , with a dozen or fifteen more , was anxiously waiting for the commander .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 30]: They all had their book-bags , pockets , and arms filled with stones lately broken for mending the turnpike road , mostly granite , but partly whinstone and flint .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 8]: One bag was ready filled for Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 33]: `` Noo , '' said the General , in the tone of Gideon of old , `` gin ony o ' ye be fleyt at the brute , jist gang hame . ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 3]: General . ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 28]: But nobody stirred , for those who were afraid had slunk away the moment they saw Alec coming up the hill , like the avenger of blood .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 8]: `` Wha 's watchin ' her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 9]: `` Doddles , Gapy , and Goat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 8]: `` Whaur was she last seen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 13]: `` Takin ' up wi ' anither tyke on the squaure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 20]: `` Doddles 'll be at the pump , to tell whaur 's the ither twa and the tyke . ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 6]: `` Come along , then .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 8]: This is hoo ye 're to gang .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 7]: We maunna a ' gang thegither .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 41]: Some o ' ye -- you three -- doon the Back Wynd ; you sax , up Lucky Hunter 's Close ; and the lave by Gowan Street ; an ' first at the pump bides for the lave . ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 12]: `` Hoo are we to mak the attack , General ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 16]: `` I 'll gie my orders as the case may demand , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 5]: And away they shot .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 65]: The muffled sounds of the feet of the various companies as they thundered past upon the snow , roused the old wives dozing over their knitting by their fires of spent oak-bark ; and according to her temper would be the remark with which each startled dame turned again to her former busy quiescence : -- `` Some mischeef o ' the loons ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 9]: `` Some ploy o ' the laddies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 13]: `` Some deevilry o ' thae rascals frae Malison 's school ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 32]: They reached the square almost together , and found Doddles at the pump ; who reported that Juno had gone down the inn-yard , and Gapey and Goat were watching her .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 49]: Now she must come out to get home again , for there was no back-way ; so by Alec 's orders they dispersed a little to avoid observation , and drew gradually between the entrance of the inn-yard , and the way Juno would take to go home .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 23]: The town was ordinarily lighted at night with oil lamps , but moonlight and snow had rendered them for some time unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 5]: `` Here she is !
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 5]: Here she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 11]: cried several at once in a hissing whisper of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 6]: `` Lat at her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 5]: `` Haud still ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 3]: cried Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 7]: `` Bide till I tell ye .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 20]: Dinna ye see there 's Lang Tam 's dog wi ' her , an ' he 's done naething .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 11]: Ye maunna punish the innocent wi ' the guilty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 30]: A moment after the dogs took their leave of each other , and Juno went , at a slow slouching trot , in the direction of her own street .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 5]: `` Close in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 3]: cried Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 17]: Juno found her way barred in a threatening manner , and sought to pass meekly by .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 8]: `` Lat at her , boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 4]: cried the General .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 23]: A storm of stones was their answer to the order ; and a howl of rage and pain burst from the animal .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 16]: She turned ; but found that she was the centre of a circle of enemies .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 5]: `` Lat at her !
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 5]: Haud at her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 3]: bawled Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 32]: And thick as hail the well-aimed stones flew from practised hands ; though of course in the frantic rushes of the dog to escape , not half of them took effect .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 24]: She darted first at one and then at another , snapping wildly , and meeting with many a kick and blow in return .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 34]: The neighbours began to look out at their shop-doors and their windows ; for the boys , rapt in the excitement of the sport , no longer laid any restraint upon their cries .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 66]: Andrew Constable , the clothier , from his shop-door ; Rob Guddle , the barber , from his window , with his face shadowed by Annie 's curls ; Redford , the bookseller , from the top of the stairs that led to his shop ; in short , the whole of the shopkeepers on the square of Glamerton were regarding this battle of odds .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 6]: The half-frozen place looked half-alive .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 20]: But none of the good folks cared much to interfere , for flying stones are not pleasant to encounter .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 13]: And indeed they could not clearly make out what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 14]: -- In a minute more , a sudden lull came over the hubbub .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 12]: They saw all the group gather together in a murmuring knot .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 5]: The fact was this .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 39]: Although cowardly enough now , the brute , infuriated with pain , had made a determined rush at one of her antagonists , and a short hand-to-teeth struggle was now taking place , during which the stoning ceased .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 26]: `` She has a grip o ' my leg , '' said Alec quietly ; `` and I hae a grip o ' her throat .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 26]: Curly , pit yer han ' i ' my jacket-pooch , an ' tak ' oot a bit towie ye 'll fin ' there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 18]: Curly did as he was desired , and drew out a yard and a half of garden-line .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 41]: `` Jist pit it wi ' ae single k-not roon ' her neck , an ' twa three o ' ye tak ' a haud at ilka en ' , and pu ' for the life o ' ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 41]: They hauled with hearty vigour , Juno 's teeth relaxed their hold of Alec 's calf ; in another minute her tongue was hanging out her mouth , and when they ceased the strain she lay limp on the snow .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 23]: With a shout of triumph , they started off at full speed , dragging the brute by the neck through the street .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 21]: Alec essayed to follow them ; but found his leg too painful ; and was forced to go limping home .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 59]: When the victors had run till they were out of breath , they stopped to confer ; and the result of their conference was that in solemn silence they drew her home to the back gate , and finding all still in the yard , deputed two of their company to lay the dead body in its kennel .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 38]: Curly and Linkum drew her into the yard , tumbled her into her barrel , which they set up on end , undid the string , and left Juno lying neck and tail together in ignominious peace .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 37]: `` Before Alec reached home his leg had swollen very much , and was so painful that he could hardly limp along ; for Juno had taken no passing snap , but a great strong mouthful .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 32]: He concealed his condition from his mother for that night ; but next morning his leg was so bad , that there was no longer a possibility of hiding the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 23]: To tell a lie would have been so hard for Alec , that he had scarcely any merit in not telling one .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 9]: So there was nothing for it but confession .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 50]: His mother scolded him to a degree considerably beyond her own sense of the wrong , telling him he would get her into disgrace in the town as the mother of a lawless son , who meddled with other people 's property in a way little better than stealing .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 25]: `` I fancy , mamma , a loun 's legs are aboot as muckle his ain property as the tyke was Rob Bruce 's .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 24]: It 's no the first time she 's bitten half a dizzen legs that were neither her ain nor her maister 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 30]: Mrs Forbes could not well answer this argument ; so she took advantage of the fact that Alec had , in the excitement of self-defence , lapsed into Scotch .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 27]: `` Do n't talk so vulgarly to me , Alec , '' she said ; `` keep that for your ill-behaved companions in the town . ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 11]: `` They are no worse than I am , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 11]: _ I _ was at the bottom of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 11]: `` I never said they were , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 18]: But in her heart she thought if they were not , there was little amiss with them .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 24]: Alec was once more condemned to the sofa , and Annie had to miss him , and wonder what had become of him .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 31]: She always felt safe when Alec was there , and when he was not she grew timid ; although whole days would sometimes pass without either speaking to the other .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 14]: But before the morning was over she learned the reason of his absence .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 31]: For about noon , when all was tolerably harmonious in the school , the door opened , and the face of Robert Bruce appeared , with gleaming eyes of wrath .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 6]: `` Guid preserve 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 7]: said Scrumpie to his next neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 13]: `` Sic a hidin ' as we s ' a ' get !
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 5]: Here 's Rob Bruce !
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 10]: Wha 's gane and tell ' t him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 20]: But some of the gang of conspirators , standing in a class near the door , stared in horror .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 5]: Amongst them was Curly .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 23]: His companions declared afterwards that had it not been for the strength of the curl , his hair would have stood upright .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 68]: For , following Bruce , led in fact by a string , came an awful apparition -- Juno herself , a pitiable mass of caninity -- looking like the resuscitated corpse of a dog that had been nine days buried , crowded with lumps , and speckled with cuts , going on three legs , and having her head and throat swollen to a size past recognition .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 9]: `` She 's no deid efter a ' !
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 5]: Deil tak ' her !
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 10]: for he 's in her , '' said Doddles .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 11]: `` We haena killed her eneuch , '' said Curly .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 9]: `` I tell ' t ye , Curly !
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 9]: Ye had little ado to lowse the tow .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 29]: She wad ha ' been as deid afore the mornin ' as Lucky Gordon 's cat that ye cuttit the heid aff o ' , '' said Linkum .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 6]: but she luiks bonnie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 10]: said Curly , trying to shake off his dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 15]: `` Man , we 'll hae ' t a ' to do ower again .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 4]: Sic fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 27]: But he could not help looking a little rueful when Linkum expressed a wish that they were themselves well through with their share of the killing .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 8]: And now the storm began to break .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 40]: The master had gone to the door and shaken hands with his visitor , glancing a puzzled interrogation at the miserable animal in the string , which had just shape enough left to show that it was a dog .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 32]: `` I 'm verra sorry , Maister Malison , to come to you wi ' my complaints , '' said Bruce ; `` but jist luik at the puir dumb animal !
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 15]: She cudna come hersel ' , an ' sae I bude to bring her .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 8]: Stan ' still , ye brute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 62]: For Juno having caught sight of some boy-legs , through a corner of one eye not quite _ bunged up _ , began to tug at the string with feeble earnestness - no longer , however , regarding the said legs as made for dogs to bite , but as fearful instruments of vengeance , in league with stones and cords .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 9]: So the straining and pulling was all homewards .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 21]: But her master had brought her as chief witness against the boys , and she must remain where she was .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 6]: `` Eh , lass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 39]: he said , hauling her back by the string ; `` gin ye had but the tongue o ' the prophet 's ass , ye wad sune pint out the rascals that misguided and misgrugled ye that gait .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 20]: But here 's the just judge that 'll gie ye yer richts , and that wi'oot fee or reward .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 29]: -- Mr Malison , she was ane o ' the bonniest bicks ye cud set yer ee upo ' -- '' A smothered laugh gurgled through the room .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 55]: - `` till some o ' your loons -- nae offence , sir -- I ken weel eneuch they 're no yours , nor a bit like ye -- some o ' your peowpils , sir , hae jist ca 'd -LRB- driven -RRB- the sowl oot o ' her wi ' stanes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 12]: `` Whaur does the sowl o ' a bitch bide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 11]: asked Goat , in a whisper , of his neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 24]: `` De'il kens , '' answered Gapey ; `` gin it binna i ' the boddom o ' Rob Bruce 's wame . ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 27]: The master 's wrath , ready enough to rise against boys and all their works , now showed itself in the growing redness of his face .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 26]: This was not one of his worst passions -- in them , he grew white -- for the injury had not been done to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 12]: `` Can you tell me which of them did it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 19]: There maun hae been mair nor twa or three at it , or she wad hae worried them .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 9]: The best-natered beast i ' the toon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 8]: `` William Macwha , '' cried Malison .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 6]: `` Here , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 5]: `` Come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 7]: Willie ascended to the august presence .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 36]: He had made up his mind that , seeing so many had known all about it , and some of them had turned cowards , it would be of no service to deny the deed .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 16]: `` Do you know anything about this cruelty to the poor dog , William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 4]: said the master .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 18]: Willie gave a Scotchman 's answer , which , while evasive , was yet answer and more .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 8]: `` She bet me , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 3]: `` When ?
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 7]: While you were stoning her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 5]: A month ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 22]: `` Ye 're a leein ' vratch , Willie Macwha , as ye weel ken i ' yer ain conscience ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 3]: cried Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 16]: `` She 's the quaietest , kin ` list beast ` at ever was wholpit .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 9]: See , sir ; jist luik ye here .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 29]: She 'll lat me pit my han ' in her mou ' , an ' tak ' no more notice nor gin it was her ain tongue . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 57]: Now whether it was that the said tongue was still swollen and painful , or that Juno , conscious of her own ill deserts , disapproved of the whole proceeding , I can not tell ; but the result of this proof of her temper was that she made her teeth meet through Bruce 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 6]: `` Damn the bitch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 13]: he roared , snatching it away with the blood beginning to flow .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 45]: A laugh , not smothered this time , billowed and broke through the whole school ; for the fact that Bruce should be caught swearing , added to the yet more delightful fact that Juno had bitten her master , was altogether too much .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 13]: isna ' t weel we didna kill her efter a ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 3]: said Curly .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 5]: `` Guid doggie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 19]: said another , patting his own knee , as if to entice her to come and be caressed .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 8]: `` At him again , Juno ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 4]: said a third .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 18]: `` I 'll gie her a piece the neist time I see her , '' said Curly .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 49]: Bruce , writhing with pain , and mortified at the result of his ocular proof of Juno 's incapability of biting , still more mortified at having so far forgotten himself as to utter an oath , and altogether discomfited by the laughter , turned away in confusion .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 12]: `` It 's a ' their wyte , the baad boys !
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 7]: She never did the like afore .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 37]: They hae ruined her temper , '' he said , as he left the school , following Juno , which was tugging away at the string as if she had been a blind man 's dog .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 14]: `` Well , what have you to say for yourself , William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 3]: said Malison .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 9]: `` She began ` t , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 13]: This best of excuses would not , however , satisfy the master .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 11]: The punishing mania had possibly taken fresh hold upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 8]: But he would put more questions first .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 10]: `` Who besides you tortured the poor animal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 4]: Curly was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 44]: He had neither a very high sense of honour , nor any principles to come and go upon ; but he had a considerable amount of devotion to his party , which is the highest form of conscience to be found in many .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 9]: `` Tell me their names , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 5]: Curly was still silent .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 44]: But a white-headed urchin , whom innumerable whippings , not bribes , had corrupted , cried out in a wavering voice : `` Sanny Forbes was ane o ' them ; an ' he 's no here , 'cause Juno worried him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 40]: The poor creature gained little by his treachery ; for the smallest of the conspirators fell on him when school was over , and gave him a thrashing , which he deserved more than ever one of Malison 's .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 13]: But the effect of Alec 's name on the master was talismanic .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 24]: He changed his manner at once , sent Curly to his seat , and nothing more was heard of Juno or her master .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 35]: The opposite neighbours stared across , the next morning , in bewildered astonishment , at the place where the shop of Robert Bruce had been wont to invite the public to enter and buy .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 33]: Had it been possible for an avalanche to fall like a thunderbolt from the heavens , they would have supposed that one had fallen in the night , and overwhelmed the house .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 19]: Door and windows were invisible , buried with the rude pavement in front beneath a mass of snow .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 49]: Spades and shovels in boys ' hands had been busy for hours during the night , throwing it up against the house , the door having first been blocked up with a huge ball , which they had rolled in silence the whole length of the long street .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 45]: Bruce and his wife slept in a little room immediately behind the shop , that they might watch over their treasures ; and Bruce 's first movement in the morning was always into the shop to unbolt the door and take down the shutters .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 15]: His astonishment when he looked upon a blank wall of snow may be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 12]: He did not question that the whole town was similarly overwhelmed .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 70]: Such a snow-storm had never been heard of before , and he thought with uneasy recollection of the oath he had uttered in the school-room ; imagining for a moment that the whole of Glamerton lay overwhelmed by the divine wrath , because he had , under the agony of a bite from his own dog , consigned her to a quarter where dogs and children are not admitted .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 11]: In his bewilderment , he called aloud : `` Nancy !
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 2]: Robbie !
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 2]: Johnnie !
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 8]: We 're a ' beeriet alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 8]: `` Preserve 's a ' , Robert !
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 5]: what 's happent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 9]: cried his wife , rushing from the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 23]: `` I 'm no beeriet , that I ken o ' , '' cried Robert the younger , entering from the yard .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 22]: His father rushed to the back-door , and , to his astonishment and relief , saw the whole world about him .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 14]: It was a private judgment , then , upon him and his shop .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 10]: And so it was -- a very private judgment .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 21]: Probably it was the result of his meditations upon it , that he never after carried complaints to Murdoch Malison .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 10]: Alec Forbes had nothing to do with this revenge .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 18]: But Bruce always thought he was at the bottom of it , and hated him the more .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 27]: He disliked all _ loons _ but his own ; for was not the spirit of _ loons _ the very antipodes to that of money-making ?
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 17]: But Alec Forbes he hated , for he was the very antipode to Robert Bruce himself .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 30]: Mrs Bruce always followed her husband 's lead , being capable only of two devotions -- the one to her husband and children , the other to the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 26]: -- Of Annie they highly and righteously disapproved , partly because they had to feed her , and partly because she was friendly with Alec .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 39]: This disapproval rose into dislike after their sons had told them that it was because Juno had bitten her that the boys of the school , with Alec for a leader , had served her as they had .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 54]: But it was productive of no disadvantage to her ; for it could not take any active form because of the money-bond between them , while its negative operation gave rise chiefly to neglect , and so left her more at liberty , to enjoy herself as she could after her own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 49]: For the rest of Juno 's existence , the moment she caught sight of a boy she fled as fast as her four bow-legs would carry her , not daring even to let her tail stick out behind her , lest it should afford a handle against her .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 12]: When Annie heard that Alec had been bitten she was miserable .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 19]: She knew his bite must be worse than hers , or he would not be kept at home .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 11]: Might she not venture to go and see him again ?
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 27]: The modesty of a maidenly child made her fear to intrude ; but she could not constrain her feet from following the path to his house .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 25]: And as it was very dusk , what harm could there be in going just inside the gate , and on to the green ?
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 48]: Through the parlour windows she saw the fire burning bright , and a shadow moving across the walls and the ceiling ; but she could not make up her mind to knock at the door , for she was afraid of Mrs Forbes , notwithstanding her kindness .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 36]: So she wandered on -- for here there was no dog -- wondering what that curious long mound of snow , with the round heap at the end , by the flag-staff , could be ?
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 8]: What could Alec have made it for ?
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 27]: Examining it closely all along , she came to the end of it next the house , and looking round , saw that it was hollow .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 17]: Without a moment 's thought , for she had no fear of Alec , she entered .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 25]: The passage was dark , but she groped her way , on and on , till she came to the cell at the end .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 36]: Here a faint ghostly light glimmered ; for Alec had cleared a small funnel upwards through the roof , almost to the outside , so that a thin light filtered through a film of snow .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 39]: This light being reflected from the white surface of the cave , showed it all throbbing about her with a faint bluish white , ever and anon whelmed in the darkness and again glimmering out through its folds .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 15]: She seated herself on a ledge of snow that ran all round the foundation .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 25]: It was not so cold here as in the outer air , where a light frosty wind was blowing across the world of snow .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 23]: And she had not sat long , before , according to her custom when left to herself , she fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 30]: Meantime Alec , his mother having gone to the town , was sitting alone , finishing , by the light of the fire , the last of a story .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 29]: At length the dreariness of an ended tale was about him , and he felt the inactivity to which he had been compelled all day no longer tolerable .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 12]: He would go and see how his snow-chamber looked by candlelight .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 37]: His mother had told him not to go out ; but that , he reasoned , could hardly be called going out , when there was not more than a yard of open air to cross .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 32]: So he got a candle , was out of the window in a moment , notwithstanding his lameness , and crept through the long vault of snow towards the inmost recess .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 8]: As he approached the end he started .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 6]: Could he believe his eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 10]: A figure was there -- motionless -- dead perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 31]: He went on -- he went in -- and there he saw Annie , leaning against the white wall , with her white face turned up to the frozen ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 35]: She might have been the frost-queen , the spirit that made the snow , and built the hut , and dwelt in it ; for all the powers that vivify nature must be children .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 38]: The popular imagination seems to have caught this truth , for all the fairies and gnomes and goblins , yes , the great giants too , are only different sizes , shapes , and characters of children .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 12]: But I have wandered from Alec 's thoughts into my own .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 14]: He knew it was Annie , and no strange creature of the elements .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 28]: And if he had not come , she might have slept on till her sleep was too deep for any voice of the world to rouse her .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 13]: It was , even then , with difficulty that he woke her .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 13]: He took hold of her hands , but she did not move .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 28]: He sat down , took her in his arms , spoke to her -- got frightened and shook her , but she would not open her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 25]: Her long dark eyelashes sloped still upon her white cheek , like the low branches of a cedar upon the lawn at its foot .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 17]: But he knew she was not dead yet , for he could feel her heart beating .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 36]: At length she lifted her eyelids , looked up in his face , gave a low happy laugh , like the laugh of a dreaming child , and was fast asleep again in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 5]: Alec hesitated no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 32]: He rose with her in his arms , carried her into the parlour , and laid her down on the rug before the fire , with a sofa-pillow under her head .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 8]: There she might have her sleep out .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 17]: When Mrs Forbes came home she found Alec reading , and Annie sleeping by the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 27]: Before his mother had recovered from her surprise , and while she was yet staring at the lovely little apparition , Alec had the first word .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 4]: `` Mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 33]: he said , `` I found her sleeping in my snow hut there ; and if I had not brought her in , she would have been dead by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 6]: `` Poor little darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 17]: thought Mrs Forbes ; but she was Scotch , and therefore she did not say it .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 36]: But she stooped , and drew the child back from the fire , lest she should have her face scorched , and after making the tea , proceeded to put off her bonnet and shawl .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 24]: By the time she had got rid of them , Annie was beginning to move , and Alec rose to go to her .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 10]: `` Let her alone , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 9]: `` Let her come to herself by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 6]: Come to the table . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 3]: Alec obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 17]: They could see that Annie had opened her eyes , and lay staring at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 6]: What was she thinking about ?
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 17]: She had fallen asleep in the snow-hut , and here she was by a bright fire !
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 18]: `` Annie , dear , come to your tea , '' were the first words she heard .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 41]: She rose and went , and sat down at the table with a smile , taking it all as the gift of God , or a good dream , and never asking how she had come to be so happy .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 21]: The spirit of mischief had never been so thoroughly aroused in the youth of Glamerton as it was this winter .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 43]: The snow lay very deep , while almost every day a fresh fall added to its depth , and this rendered some of their winter-amusements impossible ; while not many of them had the imagination of Alec Forbes to suggest new ones .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 16]: At the same time the cold increased , and strengthened their impulses to muscular exertion .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 40]: `` Thae loons are jist growin ' perfect deevils , '' said Charlie Chapman , the wool-carder , as he bolted into his own shop , with the remains of a snowball melting down the back of his neck .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 13]: `` We maun hae anither constable to haud them in order . ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 48]: The existing force was composed of one long-legged , short-bodied , middle-aged man , who was so slow in his motions , apparently from the weight of his feet , which were always dragging behind him , that the boys called him Stumpin ' Steenie -LRB- dim .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 56]: for `` Stephen '' -RRB- , and stood in no more awe of him than they did of his old cow -- which , her owner being a widower , they called _ Mrs Stephen _ -- when she went up the street , hardly able to waddle along for the weight of her udder .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 12]: So there was some little ground for the wool-carder 's remark .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 14]: How much a second constable would have availed , however , is doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 8]: `` I never saw sic widdiefows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 17]: -LRB- gallows-birds -RRB- , chimed in a farmer 's wife who was standing in the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 58]: `` They had a tow across the Wast Wynd i ' the snaw , an ' doon I cam o ' my niz , as sure 's your name 's Charles Chapman -- and mair o ' my legs oot o ' my coats , I doobt , than was a ` thegither to my credit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 49]: `` I 'm sure ye can hae no rizzon to tak ' shame o ' your legs , gude wife , '' was the gallant rejoinder ; to which their owner replied , with a laugh : `` They warna made for public inspection , ony gait . ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 3]: `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 2]: hoot !
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 4]: Naebody saw them .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 10]: I s ' warran ' ye didna lie lang !
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 11]: But thae loons -- they 're jist past a ' !
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 9]: Heard ye hoo they saired Rob Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 3]: `` Fegs !
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 12]: they tell me they a ' but buried him alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 2]: ay .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 11]: But it 's a later story , the last . ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 20]: `` It 's a pity there 's no a dizzen or twa o ' them in Awbrahawm 's boasom .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 9]: -- What did they till him neist ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 38]: Here Andrew Constable dropped in , and Chapman turned towards him with the question : `` Did _ ye _ hear , Mr Constable , what the loons did to Robert Bruce the nicht afore last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 4]: What was that ?
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 12]: They hae a spite at puir Rob , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 16]: `` Weel , it didna look a ` thegither like respeck , I maun alloo .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 102]: -- I was stannin ' at the coonter o ' his shop waitin ' for an unce o ' sneeshin ' ; and Robert he was servin ' a bit bairnie ower the coouter wi ' a pennyworth o ' triacle , when , in a jiffey , there cam ' sic a blast , an ' a reek fit to smore ye , oot o ' the bit fire , an ' the shop was fu ' o ' reek , afore ye could hae pitten the pint o ' ae thoom upo ' the pint o ' the ither .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 7]: ` Preserve 's a ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 43]: cried Rob ; but or he could say anither word , butt the house , scushlin in her bauchles , comes Nancy , rinnin ' , an ' opens the door wi ' a scraich : ` Preserve 's a ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 15]: quo ' she , ` Robert , the lum 's in a low ! '
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 4]: An ' fegs !
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 16]: atween the twa reeks , to sunder them , there was nothing but Nancy hersel .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 30]: The hoose was as fu ' as it cud haud , frae cellar to garret , o ' the blackest reek ` at ever crap oot o ' coal .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 26]: Oot we ran , an ' it was a sicht to see the crater wi ' his lang neck luikin ' up at the chimleys .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 19]: But deil a spark cam ' oot o ' them -- or reek either , for that maitter .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 9]: It was easy to see what was amiss .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 66]: The loons had been o ' the riggin , and flung a han ` fu ' o ' blastin ' powther down ilka smokin ' chimley , and syne clappit a divot or a truf upo ' the mou ' o ' ` t. Deil ane o ' them was in sicht , but I doobt gin ony o ' them was far awa ' .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 22]: There was naething for ' t but get a ladder , and jist gang up an ' tak aff the pot-lids .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 3]: But eh !
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 10]: puir Robert was jist rampin ' wi ' rage !
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 38]: No ` at he said muckle , for he daur hardly open his mou ' for sweerin ' ; and Robert wadna sweer , ye ken ; but he was neither to haud nor bin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 13]: `` What laddies war they , Charles , do ye ken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 3]: asked Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 12]: `` There 's a heap o ' them up to tricks .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 65]: Gin I haena the rheumateese screwin ' awa ' atween my shoothers the nicht it wonna be their fau ` ts ; for as I cam ' ower frae the ironmonger 's there , I jist got a ba ' i ' the how o ' my neck , ` at amaist sent me howkin ' wi ' my snoot i ' the snaw .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 33]: And there it stack , and at this preceese moment it 's rinnin ' doon the sma ' o ' my back as gin ' t war a burnie doon a hillside .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 7]: We maun hae mair constables ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 3]: `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 2]: toot !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 2]: Charles .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 10]: Ye dinna want a constable to dry yer back .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 22]: Gang to the gudewife wi ' ` t , '' said Andrew , `` she 'll gie ye a dry sark .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 4]: Na , na .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 7]: Lat the laddies work it aff .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 26]: As lang 's they haud their han 's frae what doesna belang to them , I dinna min ' a bit ploy noo and than .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 15]: They 'll noo turn oot the waur men for a pliskie or twa . ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 17]: The fact was , none of the boys would have dreamed of interfering with Andrew Constable .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 64]: Everybody respected him ; not because he was an elder of the kirk , but because he was a good-tempered , kindly , honest man ; or to sum up all in one word -- _ a douce chield _ -- by which word _ douce _ is indicated every sort of propriety of behaviour -- a virtue greatly esteemed by the Scotch .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 8]: This adjective was universally applied to Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 24]: While Alec was confined to the house , he had been busy inventing all kinds of employments for the period of the snow .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 35]: His lessons never occupied much of his thoughts , and no pains having yet been taken to discover in what direction his tastes inclined him , he had of course to cater for himself .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 48]: The first day of his return , when school was over , he set off rejoicing in his freedom , for a ramble through the snow , still revolving what he was to do next ; for he wanted some steady employment with an end in view .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 37]: In the course of his solitary walk , he came to the Wan Water , the other river that flowed through the wide valley -- and wan enough it was now with its snow-sheet over it !
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 75]: As he stood looking at its still , dead face , and lamenting that the snow lay too deep over the ice to admit of skating , by a sudden reaction , a summer-vision of the live water arose before him ; and he thought how delightful it would be to go sailing down the sparkling ripples , with the green fields all about him , and the hot afternoon sun over his head .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 13]: That would be better even than scudding along it on his skates .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 12]: His next thought was at once an idea and a resolve .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 8]: Why should he not build a boat ?
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 8]: He _ would _ build a boat .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 7]: He would set about it directly .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 11]: -- Here was work for the rest of the winter !
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 30]: His first step must be to go home and have his dinner ; his next -- to consult George Macwha , who had been a ship-carpenter in his youth .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 22]: He would run over in the evening before George should have dropped work , and commit the plan to his judgment .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 18]: In the evening , then , Alec reached the town , on his way to George Macwha .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 23]: It was a still lovely night , clear and frosty , with -- yes , there were -- millions of stars overhead .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 19]: Away in the north , the streamers were shooting hither and thither , with marvellous evanescence and re-generation .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 60]: No dance of goblins could be more lawless in its grotesqueness than this dance of the northern lights in their ethereal beauty , shining , with a wild ghostly changefulness and feebleness , all colours at once ; now here , now there , like a row of slender organ-pipes , rolling out and in and along the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 66]: Or they might have been the chords of some gigantic stringed instrument , which chords became visible only when mighty hands of music struck their keys and set them vibrating ; so that , as the hands swept up and down the Titanic key-board , the chords themselves seemed to roll along the heavens , though in truth some vanished here and others appeared yonder .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 24]: Up and down they darted , and away and back -- and always in the direction he did not expect them to take .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 35]: He thought he heard them crackle , and he stood still to listen ; but he could not be sure that it was not the snow sinking and _ crisping _ beneath his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 20]: All around him was still as a world too long frozen : in the heavens alone was there motion .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 21]: There this entrancing dance of colour and shape went on , wide beneath , and tapering up to the zenith !
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 7]: Truly there was revelry in heaven !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 53]: One might have thought that a prodigal son had just got home , and that the music and the dancing had begun , of which only the far-off rhythmic shine could reach the human sense ; for a dance in heaven might well show itself in colour to the eyes of men .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 21]: -- Alec went on till the lights from the windows of the town began to throw shadows across the snow .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 5]: The street was empty .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 11]: From end to end nothing moved but an occasional shadow .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 27]: As he came near to Macwha 's shop , he had to pass a row of cottages which stood with their backs to a steep slope .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 10]: Here too all was silent as a frozen city .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 95]: But when he was about opposite the middle of the row , he heard a stifled laugh , and then a kind of muffled sound as of hurrying steps , and , in a moment after , every door in the row was torn open , and out bolted the inhabitants -- here an old woman , halting on a stick as she came , there a shoemaker , with last and awl in his hands , here a tailor with his shears , and there a whole family of several trades and ages .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 17]: Every one rushed into the middle of the road , turned right round and looked up .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 19]: Then arose such a clamour of tongues , that it broke on the still air like a storm .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 8]: `` What 's ado , Betty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 34]: asked Alec of a decrepit old creature , bent almost double with rheumatism , who was trying hard to see something or other in the air or on the roof of her cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 23]: But before she could speak , the answer came in another form , addressing itself to his nose instead of his ears .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 76]: For out of the cottages floated clouds of smoke , pervading the air with a variety of scents -- of burning oak-bark , of burning leather-cuttings , of damp fire-wood and peat , of the cooking of red herrings , of the boiling of porridge , of the baking of oat-cake , & c. , & c. Happily for all the inhabitants , `` thae deevils o ' loons '' had used no powder here .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 50]: But the old woman , looking round when Alec spoke , and seeing that he was one of the obnoxious school-boys , broke out thus : `` Gang an ' tak the divot -LRB- turf -RRB- aff o ' my lum , Alec , there 's a good laad !
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 22]: Ye sudna play sic tricks on puir auld bodies like me , near brackin ' in twa wi ' the rheumateeze .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 16]: I 'm jist greetin ' wi ' the reek i ' my auld een . ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 12]: And as she spoke she wiped her eyes with her apron .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 34]: Alec did not wait to clear himself of an accusation so gently put , but was on the roof of Luckie Lapp 's cottage before she had finished her appeal to his generosity .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 27]: He took the `` divot aff o ' her lum '' and pitched it half way down the brae , at the back of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 20]: Then he scrambled from one chimney to the other , and went on pitching the sods down the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 64]: At length two of the inhabitants , who had climbed up at the other end of the row , met him , and taking him for a repentant sinner at best , made him prisoner , much to his amusement , and brought him down , protesting that it was too bad of gentle-folk 's sons to persecute the poor in that way .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 11]: `` I did n't do it , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 10]: `` Dinna lee , '' was the curt rejoinder .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 8]: `` I 'm no leein ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 8]: `` Wha did it , than ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 19]: `` I can guiss ; an ' it shanna happen again , gin I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 10]: `` Tell 's wha did it , than . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 7]: `` I wonno say names . ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 9]: `` He 's ane o ' them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 7]: `` The foul thief tak him !
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 20]: I s ' gie him a hidin ' , '' said a burly sutor -LRB- shoemaker -RRB- coming up .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 14]: `` Thae loons are no to be borne wi ' ony langer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 8]: And he caught Alec by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 11]: `` I did n't do it , '' persisted Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 9]: `` Wha killed Rob Bruce 's dog ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 13]: asked the sutor , squeezing Alec 's arm to point the question .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 25]: `` I did , '' answered Alec ; `` and I will do yours the same guid turn , gin he worries bairns . ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 8]: `` And quite richt , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 6]: said the sutor 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 7]: `` Lat him gang , Donal .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 14]: I 'll be boun ' he 's no ane o ' them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 10]: `` Tell 's a ' aboot it , than .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 7]: Hoo cam ye up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 16]: `` I gaed up to tak the divot aff o ' Lucky Lapp 's lum .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 4]: Spier at her .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 32]: Ance up I thocht I micht gie the lave o ' ye a gude turn , and this is a ' I get for ` t. '' `` Weel , weel !
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 17]: Come in and warm ye , than , '' said the shoemaker , convinced at last .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 20]: So Alec went in and had a chat with them , and then went on to George Macwha 's .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 9]: The carpenter took to his scheme at once .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 60]: Alec was a fair hand at all sorts of tool-work ; and being on the friendliest terms with Macwha , it was soon arranged that the keel should be laid in the end of the workshop , and that , under George 's directions , and what help Willie chose to render , Alec should build his boat himself .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 20]: Just as they concluded these preliminaries , in came Willie , wiping some traces of blood from his nose .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 10]: He made a pantomimic gesture of vengeance at Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 11]: `` What hae ye been efter noo , laddie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 4]: asked his father .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 14]: `` Alec 's jist gien me a bluidy nose , '' said Willie .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 7]: `` Hoo cam ' that aboot ?
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 10]: Ye weel deserved it , I hae nae doobt .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 12]: Jist gie him anither whan he wants it , Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 9]: `` What do ye mean , Curly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 5]: asked Alec in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 50]: `` Yon divot ` at ye flang aff o ' Luckie Lapp 's riggin ' , '' said Curly , `` cam ' richt o ' the back o ' my heid , as I lay o ' the brae , and dang the blude oot at my niz .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 5]: That 's a ' .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 14]: -- Ye 'll preten ' ye didna see me , nae doobt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 37]: `` I say , Curly , '' said Alec , putting his arm round his shoulders , and leading him aside , `` we maun hae nae mair o ' this kin ' o ' wark .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 8]: It 's a dam ' t shame !
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 23]: Do ye see nae differ atween chokin ' an ill-faured tyke an ' chokin ' a puir widow 's lum ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 7]: 'T was only for fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 15]: `` It 's ill fun that baith sides canna lauch at , Curly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 24]: `` Rob Bruce wasna lauchin ' whan he brocht the bick to the schuil , nor yet whan he gaed hame again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 8]: `` That was nae fun , Curly .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 6]: That was doonricht earnest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 14]: `` Weel , weel , Alec ; say nae mair aboot it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 6]: `` No more I will .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 21]: But gin I was you , Curly , I wad tak Lucky a seck o ' spales the morn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 10]: `` I 'll tak them the nicht , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 12]: -- Father , hae ye an auld seck ony gait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 10]: `` There 's ane up i ' the laft .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 9]: What want ye wi ' a seck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 17]: But Curly was in the loft almost before the question had left his father 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 25]: He was down again in a moment , and on his knees filling the sack with shavings and all the chips he could find .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 17]: `` Gie 's a han ' up wi ` t , Alec , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 17]: And in a moment more Curly was off to Widow Lapp with his bag of firing .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 21]: `` He 's a fine chield that Willie o ' yours , George , '' said Alec to the father .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 24]: `` He only wants to hae a thing weel pitten afore him , an ' he jist acts upo ' ' t direckly .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 14]: `` It 's weel he maks a cronie o ' you , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 10]: There 's a heap o ' mischeef in him .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 9]: Whaur 's he aff wi thae spells ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 34]: Alec told the story , much to the satisfaction of George , who could appreciate the repentance of his son ; although he was `` nane o ' the unco guid '' himself .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 16]: From that day he thought more of his son , and of Alec as well .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 39]: `` Noo , Curly , '' said Alec , as soon as he re-appeared with the empty sack , `` yer father 's gaein to lat me big a boat , an ' ye maun help me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 15]: `` What 's the use o ' a boat i ' this weather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 3]: said Curly .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 5]: `` Ye gomeril ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 18]: returned his father ; ye never luik an inch afore the pint o ' yer ain neb. .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 15]: Ye wadna think o ' a boat afore the spring ; an ' haith !
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 19]: the summer wad be ower , an ' the water frozen again , afore ye had it biggit .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 5]: Luik at Alec there .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 8]: He 's worth ten o ' you .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 14]: `` I ken that ilka bit as weel 's ye do , father .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 12]: Jist set 's aff wi ' ` t , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 30]: `` I canna attend till ' t jist i ' the noo ; but I s ' set ye aff wi ' ' t the morn 's nicht . ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 59]: So here was an end to the troubles of the townsfolks from the _ loons _ , and without any increase of the constabulary force ; for Curly being withdrawn , there was no one else of sufficiently inventive energy to take the lead , and the loons ceased to be dangerous to the peace of the community .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 14]: Curly soon had both his head and his hands quite occupied with boat-building .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 30]: Every afternoon , now , the moment dinner was over , Alec set off for the workshop , and did not return till eight o'clock , or sometimes later .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 23]: Mrs Forbes did not at all relish this change in his habits ; but she had the good sense not to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 19]: One day he persuaded her to go with him , and see how the boat was getting on .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 11]: This enticed her into some sympathy with his new pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 42]: For there was the boat -- a skeleton it is true , and not nearly ready yet for the clothing of its planks , or its final skin of paint -- yet an undeniable boat to the motherly eye of hope .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 23]: And there were Alec and Willie working away before her eyes , doing their best to fulfil the promise of its looks .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 38]: A little quiet chat she had with George Macwha , in which he poured forth the praises of her boy , did not a little , as well , to reconcile her to his desertion of her .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 91]: `` Deed , mem , '' said George , whose acquaintance with Scripture was neither extensive nor precise , `` to my mind he 's jist a fulfilment o ' the prophecee , ` An auld heid upo ' young shouthers ; ' though I canna richtly min ' whilk o ' the lesser prophets it is that conteens ` t. '' But Mrs Forbes never saw a little figure , lying in a corner , half-buried in wood-shavings , and utterly unconscious of her presence , being fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 46]: This was , of course , Annie Anderson , who having heard of the new occupation of her hero , had , one afternoon , three weeks before Mrs Forbes 's visit , found herself at George 's shop door , she hardly knew how .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 25]: It seemed to her that she had followed her feet , and they had taken her there before she knew where they were going .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 21]: Peeping in , she watched Alec and Willie for some time at their work , without venturing to show herself .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 46]: But George , who came up behind her as she stood , and perceived her interest in the operations of the boys , took her by the hand , and led her in , saying kindly : `` Here 's a new apprentice , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 7]: She wants to learn boat-biggin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 3]: `` Ou !
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 8]: Annie , is that you , lassie ?
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 8]: Come awa ' , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 23]: `` There 's a fine heap o ' spales ye can sit upo ' , and see what we 're aboot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 22]: And so saying he seated her on the shavings , and half-buried her with an armful more to keep her warm .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 12]: `` Put to the door , Willie , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 6]: `` She 'll be cauld .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 10]: She 's no workin ' , ye see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 14]: Whereupon Willie shut the door , and Annie found herself very comfortable indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 53]: There she sat , in perfect contentment , watching the progress of the boat -- a progress not very perceptible to her inexperienced eyes , for the building of a boat is like the building of a city or the making of a book : it turns out a boat at last .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 35]: But after she had sat for a good while in silence , she looked up at Alec , and said : `` Is there naething I can do to help ye , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 5]: `` Naething , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 9]: Lassies canna saw or plane , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 13]: Ye wad tak ' aff yer ain lugs in a jiffey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 31]: Again she was silent for a long time ; and then , with a sigh , she looked up and said : `` Alec , I 'm so cauld ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 16]: `` I 'll bring my plaid to row ye in the morn 's nicht . ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 19]: Annie 's heart bounded for joy ; for here was what amounted to an express invitation for to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 23]: `` But , '' Alec went on , `` come wi ' me , and we 'll sune get ye warm again .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 7]: Gie 's yer han ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 22]: Annie gave Alec her hand ; and he lifted her out of her heap of spales , and led her away .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 11]: She never thought of asking where he was leading her .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 43]: They had not gone far down the _ close _ , when a roaring sound fell upon her ear , growing louder and louder as they went on ; till , turning a sharp corner , there they saw the smithy fire .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 20]: The door of the smithy was open , and they could see the smith at work some distance off .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 17]: The fire glowed with gathered rage at the impudence of the bellows blowing in its face .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 46]: The huge smith , with one arm flung affectionately over the shoulder of the insulting party , urged it to the contest ; while he stirred up the other to increased ferocity , by poking a piece of iron into the very middle of it .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 79]: How the angry glare started out of it and stared all the murky _ smiddy _ in the face , showing such gloomy holes and corners in it , and such a lot of horse-shoes hung up close to the roof , ready to be fitted for unbelievable horse-wear ; and making the smith 's face and bare arms glow with a dusky red , like hot metal , as if he were the gnome-king of molten iron .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 41]: Then he stooped , and took up some coal dust in a little shovel , and patted it down over the fire , and blew stronger than ever , and the sparks flew out with the rage of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 91]: Annie was delighted to look at it ; but there was a certain fierceness about the whole affair that made her shrink from going nearer ; and she could not help feeling a little afraid of the giant smith in particular , with his brawny arms that twisted and tortured iron bars all day long , -- and his black angry-looking face , that seemed for ever fighting with fire and stiff-necked metal His very look into the forge-fire ought to have been enough to put it out of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 16]: Perhaps that was why it was so necessary to keep blowing and poking at it .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 69]: Again he stooped , caught up a great iron spoon , dipped it into a tub of water , and poured the spoonful on the fire -- a fresh insult , at which it hissed and sputtered , like one of the fiery flying serpents of which she had read in her Bible -- gigantic , dragon-like creatures to her imagination -- in a perfect insanity of fury .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 54]: But not the slightest motion of her hand lying in Alec 's , indicated reluctance , as he led her into the shop , and right up to the wrathful man , saying : `` Peter Whaup , here 's a lassie ` at 's ` maist frozen to deid wi ' cauld .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 21]: Will ye tak ' her in and lat her stan ' by your ingle-neuk , and warm hersel ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 8]: `` I 'll do that , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 7]: Come in by , my bairn .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 7]: What ca ' they ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 5]: `` Annie Anderson . ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 5]: `` Ow , ay !
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 9]: I ken a ' aboot ye weel eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 18]: Ye can lea ' her wi ' me , Alec ; I 'll luik efter her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 30]: `` I maun gang back to my boat , Annie , '' said Alec , then , apologetically , `` but I 'll come in for ye again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 25]: So Annie was left with the smith , of whom she was not the least afraid , now that she had heard him speak .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 106]: With his leathern apron , caught up in both hands , he swept a space on the front of the elevated hearth of the forge , clear of cinders and dust , and then , having wiped his hands on the same apron , lifted the girl as tenderly as if she had been a baby , and set her down on this spot , about a yard from the fire , on a level with it ; and there she sat , in front of the smith , looking at the fire and the smith and the work he was about , in turns .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 33]: He asked her a great many questions about herself and the Bruces , and her former life at home ; and every question he asked he put in a yet kindlier voice .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 60]: Sometimes he would stop in the middle of blowing , and lean forward with his arm on the handle of the bellows , and look full in the child 's face till she had done answering him , with eyes that shone in the firelight as if the tears would have gathered , but could not for the heat .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 3]: ay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 19]: he would say , when she had answered him , and resume his blowing , slowly and dreamily .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 12]: For this terrible smith 's heart was just like his fire .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 53]: He was a dreadful fellow for fighting and quarrelling when he got a drop too much , which was rather too often , if the truth must be told ; but to this little woman-child his ways were as soft and tender as a woman 's : he could burn or warm .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 14]: `` An ' sae ye likit bein ' at the ferm best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 3]: `` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 16]: But ye see my father deid -- '' `` I ken that , my bairn .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 10]: The Lord haud a grip o ' ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 13]: It was not often that Peter Whaup indulged in a pious ejaculation .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 39]: But this was a genuine one , and may be worth recording for the sake of Annie 's answer : `` I 'm thinkin ' he hauds a grip o ' us a ' , Mr Whaup . ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 35]: And then she told him the story about the rats and the cat ; for hardly a day passed just at this time without her not merely recalling it , but reflecting upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 60]: And the smith drew the back of his hand across both his eyes when she had done , and then pressed them both hard with the thumb and forefinger of his right hand , as if they ached , while his other arm went blowing away as if nothing was the matter but plenty of wind for the forge-fire .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 89]: Then he pulled out the red-hot _ gad _ , or iron bar , which he seemed to have forgotten ever since Annie came in , and , standing with his back to her to protect her from the sparks , put it on his anvil , and began to lay on it , as if in a fury ; while the sparks flew from his blows as if in mortal terror of the angry man that was pelting at the luminous glory laid thus submissive before him .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 45]: In fact , Peter was attempting to hammer out more things than one , upon that _ study _ of his ; for in Scotland they call a smith 's anvil a study , so that he ranks with other artists in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 44]: Then , as if anxious to hear the child speak yet again , he said , putting the iron once more in the fire , and proceeding to rouse the wrath of the coals : `` Ye kent Jeames Dow , than ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 6]: `` Ay ; weel that .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 9]: I kent Dooie as weel as Broonie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 6]: `` Wha was Broonie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 7]: naebody but my ain coo . ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 11]: `` An ' Jeames was kin ' to ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 43]: To this question no reply followed ; but Peter , who stood looking at her , saw her lips and the muscles of her face quivering an answer , which if uttered at all , could come only in sobs and tears .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 24]: But the sound of approaching steps and voices restored her equanimity , and a listening look gradually displaced the emotion on her countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 31]: Over the half-door of the shop appeared two men , each bearing on his shoulder the socks -LRB- shares -RRB- of two ploughs , to be sharpened , or set .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 30]: The instant she saw them she tumbled off her perch , and before they had got the door opened was half way to it , crying , `` Dooie !
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 3]: Dooie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 12]: Another instant and she was lifted high in Dowie 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 6]: `` My little mistress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 6]: exclaimed he , kissing her .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 7]: `` Hoo cam ye here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 13]: `` I 'm safe eneuch here , Dooie ; dinna be fleyt .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 9]: I 'll tell ye a ' aboot it .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 10]: Alec 's in George Macwha 's shop yonner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 7]: `` And wha 's Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 3]: asked Dowie .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 30]: Leaving them now to their private communications , I will relate , for the sake of its result , what passed between James Dow 's companion and the smith .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 38]: `` The last time , '' said the youth , `` that ye set my sock , Peter Whaup , ye turned it oot jist as saft 's potty , and it wore oot raither suner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 3]: `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 5]: man , ye mistak .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 5]: It wasna the sock .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 25]: It was the heid that cam ' ahin ' ` t , and kentna hoo to haud it aff o ' the stanes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 10]: My heid 's nae sae saft 's yer ain .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 27]: It 's no rosten a ' day like yours , till it 's birstled -LRB- scorched -RRB- and sung -LRB- singed -RRB- like a sheep 's .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 25]: Jist gie me a haud o ' the taings , an ' I s ' set my sock to my ain min ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 27]: Peter gave up the tongs at once , and the young fellow proceeded to put the share in the fire , and to work the bellows .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 37]: `` Ye 'll never mak ony thing o ' ' t that gait , '' said Peter , as he took the tongs from his hand , and altered the position of the share for him .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 18]: `` Ye wad hae ` it black upo ' ae side and white upo ' the ither .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 20]: Noo ca -LRB- drive -RRB- steady , an ' dinna blaw the fire aff o ' the forge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 60]: But when it came to the anvil part of the work , Peter found so many faults with the handling and the execution generally , that at length the lad threw down the tongs with a laugh and an oath intermingled , saying : `` Ye can mak ' potty o ' ' t yersel , than , Peter .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 13]: -- Ye jist min ' me o ' the Waesome Carl . ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 14]: `` What 's that o ' ` t , Rory , man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 25]: naething but a bit sang that I cam ' upo ' the ither day i ' the neuk o ' an auld newspaper . ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 11]: `` Lat 's hear ` t , '' said Peter .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 7]: `` Sing ` t , Rory .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 15]: Ye 're better kent for a guid sang than for settin ' socks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 39]: `` I canna sing ` t , for I dinna ken the tune o ' ` t. I only got a glimp ' o ' ` t , as I tell ye , in an auld news . ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 9]: `` Weel , say ` t , than .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 16]: Ye 're as weel kent for a guid memory , as a guid sang . ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 15]: Without more preamble , Rory repeated , with appropriate gesture , THE WAESOME CARL .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 39]: There cam a man to oor toon-en ' , An ' a waesome carl was he ; Wi ' a snubbert nose , an ' a crookit mou ' , An ' a cock in his left ee .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 39]: And muckle he spied , and muckle he spak ' ; But the burden o ' his sang Was aye the same , and ower again : There 's nane o ' ye a ' but 's wrang .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 37]: Ye 're a ' wrang , and a ' wrang , And a ` thegither a ' wrang ; There 's no a man aboot the town , But 's a ` thegither a ' wrang .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 34]: That 's no the gait to bake the breid , Nor yet to brew the yill ; That 's no the gait to haud the pleuch , Nor yet to ca the mill .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 31]: That 's no the gait to milk the coo , Nor yet to spean the calf ; Nor yet to fill the girnel-kist -- Ye kenna yer wark by half .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 9]: Ye 're a ' wrang , & c .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 31]: The minister was na fit to pray , And lat alane to preach ; He nowther had the gift o ' grace , Nor yet the gift o ' speech .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 36]: He mind ' t him o ' Balaam 's ass , Wi ' a differ ye may ken : The Lord he open 'd the ass 's mou ' The minister open 'd 's ain .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 9]: He 's a ' wrang , & c .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 24]: The puir precentor cudna sing , He gruntit like a swine ; The verra elders cudna pass The ladles till his min ' .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 29]: And for the rulin ' elder 's grace , It wasna worth a horn ; He didna half uncurse the meat , Nor pray for mair the morn .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 44]: He 's a ' wrang , & c. And aye he gied his nose a thraw , And aye he crookit his mou ' ; And aye he cockit up his ee , And said , `` Tak ' tent the noo . ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 28]: We leuch ahint oor loof -LRB- palm -RRB- , man , And never said him nay : And aye he spak ' -- jist lat him speik !
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 29]: And aye he said his say : Ye 're a ' wrang , & c. Quo ' oor guidman : `` The crater 's daft ; But wow !
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 21]: he has the claik ; Lat 's see gin he can turn a han ' Or only luik and craik .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 38]: It 's true we maunna lippen till him -- He 's fairly crack wi ' pride ; But he maun live , we canna kill him -- Gin he can work , he s ' bide . ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 55]: He was a ' wrang , & c. `` It 's true it 's but a laddie 's turn , But we 'll begin wi ' a sma ' thing ; There 's a ' thae weyds to gather an ' burn -- An ' he 's the man for a ' thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 48]: We gaed oor wa 's , and loot him be , To do jist as he micht ; We think to hear nae mair o ' him , Till we come hame at nicht ; But we 're a ' wrang , & c. For , losh !
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 30]: or it was denner-time , The lift -LRB- firmament -RRB- was in a low ; The reek rase up , as it had been Frae Sodom-flames , I vow .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 18]: We ran like mad ; but corn and byre War blazin ' -- wae 's the fell !
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 16]: - As gin the deil had broucht the fire , To mak ' anither hell .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 43]: 'T was a ' wrang , & c. And by the blaze the carl stud , Wi 's han 's aneath his tails ; And aye he said -- `` I tauld ye sae , An ' ye 're to blame yersels .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 42]: It 's a ' your wite -LRB- blame -RRB- , for ye 're a ' wrang -- Ye 'll maybe ow n't at last : What gart ye burn thae deevilich weyds , Whan the win ' blew frae the wast ?
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 40]: Ye 're a ' wrang , and a ' wrang , And a ` thegither a ' wrang ; There 's no a man in a ' the warl ' But 's a ` thegither a ' wrang . ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 50]: Before the recitation was over , which was performed with considerable spirit and truth , Annie and Dowie were listening attentively , along with Alec , who had returned to take Annie back , and who now joined loudly in the applause which followed the conclusion of the verses .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 19]: `` Faith , that was a chield to haud oot ower frae , '' said Alec to Rory .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 8]: `` And ye said the sang weel .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 10]: Ye sud learn to sing ' t though . ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 35]: `` Maybe I may , some day ; gin I cud only get a grainie saut to pit upo ' the tail o ' the bird that kens the tune o ' ` t .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 9]: What ca ' they you , noo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 12]: `` Alec Forbes , '' answered the owner of the name .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 33]: `` Ay , '' interposed Annie , addressing herself to Dowie , who still held her in his arms ; `` this is Alec , that I tell ' t ye aboot .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 7]: He 's richt guid to me .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 20]: Alec , here 's Dooie , ` at I like better nor onybody i ' the warl ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 43]: And she turned and kissed the bronzed face , which was a clean face , notwithstanding the contrary appearance given to it by a beard of three days ' growth , which Annie 's kiss was too full of love to mind .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 34]: Annie would have been yet more ready to tell Dowie and Alec each who the other was , had she not been occupied in her own mind with a discovery she had made .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 17]: For had not those verses given evident delight to the company -- Alec among the rest ?
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 8]: Had he not applauded loudest of all ?
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 37]: -- Was there not here something she could do , and so contribute to the delight of the workmen , Alec and Willie , and thus have her part in the boat growing beneath their hands ?
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 41]: She would then be no longer a tolerated beholder , indebted to their charity for permission to enjoy their society , but a contributing member of the working community -- if not working herself , yet upholding those that wrought .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 26]: The germ of all this found itself in her mind that moment , and she resolved before next night to be able to emulate Rory .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 25]: Dowie carried her home in his arms , and on the way she told him all about the kindness of Alec and his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 38]: He asked her many questions about the Bruces ; but her patient nature , and the instinctive feeling that it would make Dowie unhappy , withheld her from representing the discomforts of her position in strong colours .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 12]: Dowie , however , had his own thoughts on the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 11]: `` Hoo are ye the nicht , Mr Dow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 40]: said Robert , who treated him with oily respect , because he was not only acquainted with all Annie 's affairs , but was a kind of natural , if not legal , guardian of her and her property .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 18]: `` And whaur did ye fa ' in wi ' this stray lammie o ' oors ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 36]: `` She 's been wi ' me this lang time , '' answered Dow , declining , with Scotch instinct , to give an answer , before he understood all the drift of the question .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 10]: A Scotchman would always like the last question first .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 52]: `` She 's some ill for rinnin ' oot , '' said Bruce , with soft words addressed to Dow , and a cutting look flung at Annie , `` withoot speirin ' leave , and we dinna ken whaur she gangs ; and that 's no richt for lass-bairns . ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 14]: `` Never ye min ' her , Mr Bruce , '' replied Dow .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 29]: `` I ken her better nor you , no meanin ' ony offence , seein ' she was i ' my airms afore she was a week auld .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 47]: Lat her gang whaur she likes , and gin she does what she sudna do , I 'll tak a ' the wyte o ' ` t. '' Now there was no great anxiety about Annie 's welfare in the mind of Mr or Mrs Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 42]: The shop and their own children , chiefly the former occupied their thoughts , and the less trouble they had from the presence of Annie , the better pleased they were -- always provided they could escape the censure of neglect .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 13]: Hence it came that Annie 's absences were but little inquired into .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 24]: All the attention they did show her , seemed to them to be of free grace and to the credit of their charity .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 30]: But Bruce did not like the influence that James Dow had with her ; and before they retired for the night , he had another lecture ready for Annie .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 24]: `` Annie , '' he said , `` it 's no becomin ' for ane i ' your station to be sae familiar .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 22]: Ye 'll be a young leddy some day , and it 's no richt to tak up wi ' servan 's .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 39]: There 's Jeames Doo , jist a labourin ' man , and aneath your station a ` thegether , and he taks ye up in 's airms , as gin ye war a bairn o ' 's ain .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 6]: It 's no proaper . ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 28]: `` I like Jamie Doo better nor onybody i ' the haill warl , '' said Annie , `` excep ' -- '' Here she stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 13]: She would not expose her heart to the gaze of that man .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 6]: `` Excep ' wha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 3]: urged Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 13]: `` I 'm no gaein to say , '' returned Annie firmly .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 29]: `` Ye 're a camstairie -LRB- perverse -RRB- lassie , '' said Bruce , pushing her away with a forceful acidity in the combination of tone and push .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 12]: She walked off to bed , caring nothing for his rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 30]: For since Alec 's kindness had opened to her a well of the water of life , she had almost ceased to suffer from the ungeniality of her guardians .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 13]: She forgot them as soon as she was out of their sight .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 11]: And certainly they were nicer to forget than to remember .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 8]: -LSB- sic , should be XXII . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 29]: As soon as she was alone in her room she drew from her pocket a parcel containing something which Dowie had bought for her on their way home .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 19]: When undone it revealed two or three tallow candles , a precious present in view of her hopes .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 24]: But how should she get a light -- for this was long before lucifer matches had risen even upon the horizon of Glamerton ?
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 6]: There was but one way .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 26]: She waited , sitting on the edge of her bed , in the cold and darkness , until every sound in the house had ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 24]: Then she stepped cautiously down the old stair , which would crack now and then , use what care and gentleness she might .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 80]: It was the custom in all the houses of Glamerton to _ rest _ the fire ; that is , to keep it gently alive all night by the help of a _ truff _ , or sod cut from the top of a peat-moss -- a coarse peat in fact , more loose and porous than the peat proper -- which they laid close down upon the fire , destroying almost all remaining draught by means of coal-dust .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 40]: To this sealed fountain of light the little maiden was creeping through the dark house , with one of her _ dips _ in her hand -- the pitcher with which she was about to draw from the fountain .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 135]: And a pretty study she would have made for any child-loving artist , when , with her face close to the grate , her mouth puckered up to do duty as the nozzle of a pair of bellows , one hand holding a twisted piece of paper between the bars , and the other buttressing the whole position from the floor , she blew at the live but reluctant fire , a glow spreading at each breath over her face , and then fading as the breath ceased , till at last the paper caught , and lighting it up from without with flame , and from within with the shine of success , made the lovely child-countenance like the face of one that has found the truth after the search of weary days .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 20]: Thus she lighted her candle , and again with careful steps she made her way to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 43]: Setting the candle in a hole in the floor , left by the departure of a resinous knot , she opened her box , in which lay the few books her aunt had thrown into it when she left her old home .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 38]: She had not yet learned to care much about books ; but one of these had now become precious in her eyes , because she knew it contained poems that her father had been fond of reading .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 35]: She soon found it -- a volume by some Scotch poet of little fame , whose inward commotions had generated their own alleviation in the harmonies of ordered words in which they embodied themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 39]: In it Annie searched for something to learn before the following night , and found a ballad the look of which she liked , and which she very soon remembered as one she had heard her father read .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 68]: It was very cold work to learn it at midnight , in winter , and in a garret too ; but so intent was she , that before she went to bed , she had learned four or five verses so thoroughly that she could repeat them without thinking of what came next , and these she kept saying over and over again even in her dreams .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 42]: As soon as she woke in the dark morning she put her hand under her pillow to feel the precious volume , which she hoped would be the bond to bind her yet more closely to the boat and its builders .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 30]: She took it to school in her pocket , learning the whole way as she went , and taking a roundabout road that her cousins might not interrupt her .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 20]: She kept repeating and peeping every possible moment during school hours , and then all the way home again .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 49]: So that by the time she had had her dinner , and the gauzy twilight had thickened to the `` blanket of the dark , '' she felt quite ready to carry her offering of `` the song that lightens toil , '' to George Macwha 's workshop .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 28]: How clever they must be , she thought , as she went along , to make such a beautiful thing as the boat was now growing to !
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 23]: And she felt in her heart a kind of love for the look of living grace that the little craft already wore .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 37]: Indeed before it was finished she had learned to regard it with a feeling of mingled awe , affection , and admiration , and the little boat had made for itself a place in her brain .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 39]: When she entered , she found the two boys already in busy talk ; and without interrupting them by a word , she took her place on the heap of shavings which had remained undisturbed since last night .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 35]: After the immediate consultation was over , and the young carpenters had settled to their work -- not knowing what introduction to give to her offering , she produced it without any at all .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 40]: The boys did not know what to make of it at first , hearing something come all at once from Annie 's lips which was neither question nor remark , and broke upon the silence like an alien sound .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 25]: But they said nothing -- only gave a glance at each other and at her , and settled down to listen and to work .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 13]: Nor did they speak one word until she had finished the ballad .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 27]: `` THE LAST WOOING , '' said Annie , all at once , and went on : `` O lat me in , my bonny lass !
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 27]: It 's a lang road ower the hill ; And the flauchterin ' snaw began to fa ' , As I cam by the mill . ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 34]: `` This is nae change-hoose , John Munro , And ye needna come nae mair : Ye crookit yer mou ' , and lichtlied me , Last Wednesday , at the fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 6]: `` I lichtlied ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 6]: `` Aboon the glass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 27]: `` Foul-fa ' the ill-faured mouth That made the leein ' word to pass , By rowin ' ' t -LRB- wrapping -RRB- in the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 28]: The fac ' was this : I dochtna bide To hear yer bonnie name , Whaur muckle mous war opened wide Wi ' lawless mirth and shame .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 10]: And a ' I said was : ` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 13]: lat sit ; She 's but a bairn , the lass . '
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 21]: It turned the spait -LRB- flood -RRB- o ' words a bit , And loot yer fair name pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 9]: `` Thank ye for naething , John Munro !
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 23]: My name can gang or bide ; It 's no a sough o ' drucken words Wad turn my heid aside . ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 10]: `` O Elsie , lassie o ' my ain !
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 24]: The drift is cauld and strang ; O tak me in ae hour , and syne I 'll gather me and gang . ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 14]: `` Ye 're guid at fleechin ' -LRB- wheedling -RRB- , Jock Munro .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 23]: For ye heedna fause and true : Gang in to Katie at the Mill , She lo'es sic like as you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 10]: He turned his fit ; he spak nae mair .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 31]: The lift was like to fa ' ; And Elsie 's heart grew grit and sair -LRB- big and sore -RRB- , At sicht o ' the drivin ' snaw .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 33]: She laid her doun , but no to sleep , For her verra heart was cauld ; And the sheets war like a frozen heap O ' snaw aboot her faul 'd .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 7]: She rase fu ' ear ' .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 29]: And a ' theroot Was ae braid windin ' sheet ; At the door-sill , or winnock-lug -LRB- window-corner -RRB- , Was never a mark o ' feet .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 29]: She crap a ' day aboot the hoose , Slow-fittit and hert-sair , Aye keekin ' oot like a frichtit moose , -- But Johnnie cam nae mair !
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 29]: When saft the thow begud to melt Awa ' the ghaistly snaw , Her hert was safter nor the thow , Her pride had ta'en a fa . '
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 35]: And she oot ower the hill wad gang , Whaur the sun was blinkin ' bonnie , To see his auld minnie -LRB- mother -RRB- in her cot , And speir aboot her Johnnie .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 31]: But as alang the hill she gaed , Through snaw und slush and weet , She stoppit wi ' a chokin ' cry -- 'T was Johnnie at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 36]: His heid was smoored aneath the snaw , But his breist was maistly bare ; And ` twixt his breist and his richt han ' , He claisp ' t a lock o ' hair .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 10]: 'T was gowden hair : she kent it weel .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 7]: Alack , the sobs and sighs !
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 15]: The warm win ' blew , the laverock flew , But Johnnie wadna rise .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 37]: The spring cam ower the wastlin -LRB- westward -RRB- hill , And the frost it fled awa ' ; And the green grass luikit smilin ' up , Nane the waur for a ' the snaw .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 31]: And saft it grew on Johnnie 's grave , Whaur deep the sunshine lay ; But , lang or that , on Elsie 's heid The gowden hair was gray .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 31]: George Macwha , who was at work in the other end of the shop when she began , had drawn near , chisel in hand , and joined the listeners .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 7]: `` Weel dune , Annie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 24]: exclaimed he , as soon as she had finished - feeling very shy and awkward , now that her experiment had been made .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 11]: But she had not long to wait for the result .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 19]: `` Say ' t ower again , Annie , '' said Alec , after a moment 's pause .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 7]: Could she have wished for more ?
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 7]: She did say it over again .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 5]: `` Eh , Annie !
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 5]: that 's rale bonnie .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 7]: Whaur did ye get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 15]: `` In an auld buikie o ' my father 's , '' answered she .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 11]: `` Is there ony mair i n't like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 6]: `` Ay , lots . ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 15]: `` Jist learn anither , will ye , afore the morn 's nicht ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 9]: `` I 'll do that , Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 9]: `` Dinna ye like it , Curly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 9]: asked Alec , for Curly had said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 5]: `` Ay , fegs !
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 12]: -LRB- faith -RRB- '' was Curly 's emphatic and uncritical reply .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 26]: Annie therefore learned and repeated a few more , which , if not received with equal satisfaction , yet gave sufficient pleasure to the listeners .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 28]: They often , however , returned to the first , demanding it over and over again , till at length they knew it as well as she .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 13]: Hut a check was given for a while to these forenight meetings .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 21]: A rapid thaw set in , and up through the vanishing whiteness dawned the dark colours of the wintry landscape .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 18]: For a day or two the soft wet snow lay mixed with water over all the road .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 7]: After that came mire and dirt .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 19]: But it was still so far off spring , that nobody cared to be reminded of it yet .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 51]: So when , after the snow had vanished , a hard black frost set in , it was welcomed by the schoolboys at least , whatever the old people and the poor people , and especially those who were both old and poor , may have thought of the change .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 37]: Under the binding power of this frost , the surface of the slow-flowing Glamour and of the swifter Wan-Water , were once more chilled and stiffened to ice , which every day grew thicker and stronger .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 43]: And now , there being no coverlet of snow upon it , the boys came out in troops , in their iron-shod shoes and their clumsy skates , to skim along those floors of delight that the winter had laid for them .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 19]: To the fishes the ice was a warm blanket cast over them to keep them from the frost .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 31]: But they must have been dismayed at the dim rush of so many huge forms above them , as if another river with other and awful fishes had buried theirs .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 35]: Alec and Willie left their boat -- almost for a time forgot it -- repaired their skates , joined their school-fellows , and shot along the solid water with the banks flying past them .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 16]: It was strange to see the banks thus from the middle surface of the water .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 35]: All was strange about them ; and the delight of the strangeness increased the delight of the motion , and sent the blood through their veins swift as their flight along the frozen rivers .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 27]: For many afternoons and into the early nights , Alec and Curly held on the joyful sport , and Annie was for the time left lonely .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 8]: But she was neither disconsolate nor idle .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 9]: The boat was a sure pledge for them .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 9]: To the boat and her they must return .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 36]: She went to the shop still , now and then , to see George Macwha , who , of an age beyond the seduction of ice and skates , kept on steadily at his work .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 23]: To him she would repeat a ballad or two , at his request , and then go home to increase her stock .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 28]: This was now a work of some difficulty , for her provision of candles was exhausted , and she had no money with which to buy more .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 10]: The last candle had come to a tragical end .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 40]: For , hearing steps approaching her room one morning , before she had put it away in its usual safety in her box , she hastily poked it into one of the holes in the floor and forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 11]: When she sought it at night , it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 36]: Her first dread was that she had been found out ; but hearing nothing of it , she concluded at last that her enemies the _ rottans _ had carried it off and devoured it .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 14]: `` Deil choke them upo ' the wick o ' ` t ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 18]: exclaimed Curly , when she told him the next day , seeking a partner in her grief .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 9]: But a greater difficulty had to be encountered .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 40]: It was not long before she had exhausted her book , from which she had chosen the right poems by insight , wonderfully avoiding by instinct the unsuitable , without knowing why , and repelled by the mere tone .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 29]: She thought day and night where additional _ pabulum _ might be procured , and at last came to the resolution of applying to Mr Cowie the clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 16]: Without consulting any one , she knocked on an afternoon at Mr Cowie 's door .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 8]: `` Cud I see the minister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 6]: she said to the maid .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 5]: `` I dinna ken .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 6]: What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 6]: was the maid 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 37]: But Annie was Scotch too , and perhaps perceived that she would have but a small chance of being admitted into the minister 's presence if she communicated the object of her request to the servant .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 18]: So she only replied , `` I want to see himsel ' , gin ye please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 12]: `` Weel , come in , and I 'll tell him .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 6]: What 's yer name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 11]: `` Annie Anderson '' `` Whaur do ye bide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 13]: `` At Mr Bruce 's , i ' the Wast Wynd . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 52]: The maid went , and presently returning with the message that she was to `` gang up the stair , '' conducted her to the study where the minister sat -- a room , to Annie 's amazement , filled with books from the top to the bottom of every wall .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 25]: Mr Cowie held out his hand to her , and said , `` Well , my little maiden , what do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 14]: `` Please , sir , wad ye len ' me a sang-buik ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 5]: `` A psalm-book ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 27]: said the minister , hesitatingly , supposing he had not heard aright , and yet doubting if this could be the correction of his auricular blunder .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 12]: `` Na , sir ; I hae a psalm-buik at hame .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 14]: It 's a sang-buik that I want the len ' o ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 28]: Now the minister was one of an old school -- a very worthy kind-hearted man , with nothing of what has been called _ religious experience _ .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 21]: But he knew what some of his Lord 's words meant , and amongst them certain words about little children .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 26]: He had a feeling likewise , of more instinctive origin , that to be kind to little children was an important branch of his office .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 45]: So he drew Annie close to him , as he sat in his easy-chair , laid his plump cheek against her thin white one , and said in the gentlest way : `` And what do you want a song-book for , dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 11]: `` To learn bonnie sangs oot o ' , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 21]: Dinna ye think they 're the bonniest things in a ' the warl ' , -- sangs , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 17]: For Annie had by this time learned to love ballad-verse above everything but Alec and Dowie .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 12]: `` And what kind o ' sangs do ye like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 8]: the clergyman asked , instead of replying .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 13]: `` I like them best that gar ye greit , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 17]: At every answer , she looked up in his face with her open clear blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 22]: And the minister began to love her not merely because she was a child , but because she was this child .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 7]: `` Do ye sing them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 17]: he asked , after a little pause of pleased gazing into the face of the child .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 10]: `` Na , na ; I only say them .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 10]: I dinna ken the tunes o ' them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 11]: `` And do you say them to Mr Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 6]: `` Mr Bruce , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 8]: Mr Bruce wad say I was daft .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 25]: I wadna say a sang to him , sir , for -- for -- for a ' the sweeties i ' the shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 11]: `` Well , who do you say them to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 8]: `` To Alec Forbes and Willie Macwha .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 27]: They 're biggin a boat , sir ; and they like to hae me by them , as they big , to say sangs to them .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 8]: And I like it richt weel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 31]: `` It 'll be a lucky boat , surely , '' said the minister , `` to rise to the sound of rhyme , like some old Norse war-ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 20]: `` I dinna ken , sir , '' said Annie , who certainly did not know what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 49]: Now the minister 's acquaintance with any but the classic poets was very small indeed ; so that , when he got up and stood before his book-shelves , with the design of trying what he could do for her , he could think of nobody but Milton .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 44]: So he brought the _ Paradise Lost _ from its place , where it had not been disturbed for years , and placing it before her on the table , for it was a quarto copy , asked her if that would do .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 39]: She opened it slowly and gently , with a reverential circumspection , and for the space of about five minutes , remained silent over it , turning leaves , and tasting , and turning , and tasting again .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 53]: At length , with one hand resting on the book , she turned to Mr Cowie , who was watching with much interest and a little anxiety the result of the experiment , and said gently and sorrowfully : `` I dinna think this is the richt buik for me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 13]: There 's nae sang i n't that I can fin ' out .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 15]: It gangs a ' straucht on , and never turns or halts a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 47]: Noo ye see , sir , a sang aye turns roun ' , and begins again , and afore lang it comes fairly to an en ' , jist like a day , sir , whan we gang to oor beds an ' fa ' asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 21]: But this hauds on and on , and there 's no end till ' t ava -LRB- at all -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 18]: It 's jist like the sun that ` never tires nor stops to rest . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 70]: ` But round the world he shines , ' '' said the clergyman , completing the quotation , right good-humouredly , though he was somewhat bewildered ; for he had begun to fall a-marvelling at the little dingy maiden , with the untidy hair and dirty frock , who had thoughts of her own , and would not concede the faculty of song to the greatest of epic poets .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 46]: Doubtless if he had tried her with some of the short poems at the end of the _ Paradise Regained _ , which I doubt if he had ever even read , she would at least have allowed that they were not devoid of song .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 17]: But it was better perhaps that she should be left free to follow her own instincts .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 30]: The true teacher is the one who is able to guide those instincts , strengthen them with authority , and illuminate them with revelation of their own fundamental truth .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 14]: The best this good minister could do was not to interfere with them .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 55]: He was so anxious to help her , however , that , partly to gain some minutes for reflection , partly to get the assistance of his daughters , he took her by the hand , and led her to the dining-room , where tea was laid for himself and his two grown-up girls .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 40]: She went without a thought of question or a feeling of doubt ; for however capable she was of ordering her own way , nothing delighted her more than blind submission , wherever she felt justified in yielding it .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 23]: It was a profound pleasure to her not to know what was coming next , provided some one whom she loved did .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 17]: So she sat down to tea with the perfect composure of submission to a superior will .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 24]: It never occurred to her that she had no right to be there ; for had not the minister himself led her there ?
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 9]: And his daughters were very kind and friendly .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 86]: In the course of the meal , Mr Cowie having told them the difficulty he was in , they said that perhaps they might be able to find what she wanted , or something that might take the place of it ; and after tea , one of them brought two volumes of ballads of all sorts , some old , some new , some Scotch , some English , and put them into Annie 's hands , asking her if that book would do .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 24]: The child eagerly opened one of the volumes , and glanced at a page : It sparkled with the right ore of ballad-words .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 14]: The Red , the colour always of delight , grew in her face .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 33]: She closed the book as if she could not trust herself to look at it while others were looking at her , and said with a sigh : `` Eh , mem !
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 11]: Ye wonna lippen them _ baith _ to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 11]: `` Yes , I will , '' said Miss Cowie .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 13]: `` I am sure you will take care of them . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 29]: _ That -- I -- will _ , '' returned Annie , with an honesty and determination of purpose that made a great impression upon Mr Cowie especially .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 19]: And she ran home with a feeling of richness of possession such as she had never before experienced .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 38]: Her first business was to scamper up to her room , and hide the precious treasures in her _ kist _ , there to wait all night , like the buried dead , for the coming morning .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 55]: When she confessed to Mr Bruce that she had had tea with the minister , he held up his hands in the manner which commonly expresses amazement ; but what the peculiar character or ground of the amazement might be remained entirely unrevealed , for he said not a word to elucidate the gesture .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 23]: The next time Annie went to see the minister it was on a very different quest from the loan of a song-book .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 38]: One afternoon , as Alec went home to dinner , he was considerably surprised to find Mr Malison leaning on one of the rails of the foot-bridge over the Glamour , looking down upon its frozen surface .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 39]: There was nothing supernatural or alarming in this , seeing that , after school was over , Alec had run up the town to the saddler 's , to get a new strap for one of his skates .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 20]: What made the fact surprising was , that the scholars so seldom encountered the master anywhere except in school .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 24]: Alec thought to pass , but the moment his foot was on the bridge the master lifted himself up , and faced round .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 18]: `` Well , Alec , '' he said , `` where have _ you _ been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 14]: `` To get a new strap for my skatcher , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 13]: `` You 're fond of skating -- are you , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 11]: `` I used to be when I was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 7]: Have you had your dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 13]: `` Then I suppose your mother has not dined , either ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 12]: `` She never does till I go home , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 9]: `` Then I wo n't intrude upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 9]: I did mean to call this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 12]: `` She will be very glad to see you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 11]: Come and take a share of what there is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 11]: `` I think I had better not , Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 5]: `` Do , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 10]: I am sure she will make you welcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 4]: Mr Malison hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 4]: Alec pressed him .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 11]: He yielded ; and they went along the road together .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 34]: I shall not have to show much more than half of Mr Malison 's life -- the school half , which , both inwardly and outwardly , was very different from the other .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 49]: The moment he was out of the school , the moment , that is , that he ceased for the day to be responsible for the moral and intellectual condition of his turbulent subjects , the whole character -- certainly the whole deportment -- of the man changed .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 18]: He was now as meek and gentle in speech and behaviour as any mother could have desired .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 8]: Nor was the change a hypocritical one .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 38]: The master never interfered , or only upon the rarest occasions when pressure from without was brought to bear upon him , as in the case of Juno , with what the boys did out of school .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 52]: He was glad enough to accept utter irresponsibility for that portion of his time ; so that between the two parts of the day , as they passed through the life of the master , there was almost as little connection as between the waking and sleeping hours of a somnambulist .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 33]: But , as he leaned over the rail of the bridge , whither a rare impulse to movement had driven him , his thoughts had turned upon Alec Forbes and his antagonism .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 47]: Out of school , he could not help feeling that the boy had not been very far wrong , however subversive of authority his behaviour had been ; but it was not therefore the less mortifying to think how signally he had been discomfited by him .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 53]: And he was compelled moreover to acknowledge to himself that it was a mercy that Alec was not the boy to follow up his advantage by heading -- not a party against the master , but the whole school , which would have been ready enough to follow such a victorious leader .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 35]: So there was but one way of setting matters right , as Mr Malison had generosity enough left in him to perceive ; and that was , to make a friend of his adversary .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 24]: Indeed there is that in the depths of every human breast which makes a reconciliation the only victory that can give true satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 29]: Nor was the master the only gainer by the resolve which thus arose in his mind the very moment before he felt Alec 's tread upon the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 33]: They walked together to Howglen , talking kindly the whole way ; to which talk , and most likely to which kindness between them , a little incident had contributed as well .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 35]: Alec had that day rendered a passage of Virgil with a remarkable accuracy , greatly pleasing to the master , who , however , had no idea to what this isolated success was attributable .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 52]: I forget the passage ; but it had reference to the setting of sails , and Alec could not rest till he had satisfied himself about its meaning ; for when we are once interested in anything , we want to see it nearer as often as it looms in sight .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 29]: So he had with some difficulty cleared away the mists that clung about the words , till at length he beheld and understood the fact embodied in them .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 28]: Alec had never had praise from Mr Malison before -- at least none that had made any impression on him -- and he found it very sweet .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 24]: And through the pleasure dawned the notion that perhaps he might be a scholar after all if he gave his mind to it .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 74]: In this he was so far right : a fair scholar he might be , though a learned man he never could be , without developing an amount of will , and effecting a degree of self-conquest , sufficient for a Jesuit , -- losing at the same time not only what he was especially made for knowing , but , in a great measure , what he was especially made for being .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 44]: Few , however , are in danger of going so grievously against the intellectual impulses of their nature : far more are in danger of following them without earnestness , or if earnestly , then with the absorption of an eagerness only worldly .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 49]: Mrs Forbes , seeing the pleasure expressed on Alec 's countenance , received Mr Malison with more than the usual cordiality , forgetting when he was present before her eyes what she had never failed to think of with bitterness when he was only present to her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 21]: As soon as dinner was over Alec rushed off to the river , leaving his mother and the master together .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 24]: Mrs Forbes brought out the whisky-bottle , and Mr Malison , mixing a tumbler of toddy , filled a wine-glass for his hostess .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 25]: `` We 'll make a man of Alec some day yet , '' said he , giving an ill-considered form to his thoughts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 4]: ` Deed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 35]: returned Mrs Forbes , irritated at the suggestion of any difficulty in the way of Alec 's ultimate manhood , and perhaps glad of the opportunity of speaking her mind -- '' ` Deed !
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 18]: Mr Malison , ye made a bonnie munsie -LRB- monsieur -RRB- o ' him a month ago .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 20]: It wad set ye weel to try yer hand at makin ' a man o ' him noo . ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 17]: Had Alec been within hearing , he would never have let his mother forget this speech .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 20]: For had not she , the immaculate , the reprover , fallen herself into the slough of the vernacular ?
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 31]: The fact is , it is easier to speak the truth in a _ patois _ , for it lies nearer to the simple realities than a more conventional speech .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 21]: I do not however allow that the Scotch is a _ patois _ in the ordinary sense of the word .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 32]: For had not Scotland a living literature , and that a high one , when England could produce none , or next to none -- I mean in the fifteenth century ?
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 39]: But old age , and the introduction of a more polished form of utterance , have given to the Scotch all the other advantages of a _ patois _ , in addition to its own directness and simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 33]: For a moment the dominie was taken aback , and sat reddening over his toddy , which , not daring even to taste it , he went on stirring with his toddy-ladle .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 37]: For one of the disadvantages of a broken life is , that what a person may do with a kind of conscience in the one part , he feels compelled to blush for in the other .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 36]: The despotism exercised in the school , even though exercised with a certain sense of justice and right , made the autocrat , out of school , cower before the parents of his helpless subjects .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 37]: And this quailing of heart arose not merely from the operation of selfish feelings , but from a deliquium that fell upon his principles , in consequence of their sudden exposure to a more open atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 68]: But with a sudden perception that his only chance was to throw himself on the generosity of a woman , he said : `` Well , ma'am , if you had to keep seventy boys and girls quiet , and hear them their lessons at the same time , perhaps you would find yourself in danger of doing in haste what you might repent at leisure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 16]: `` Weel , weel , Mr Malison , we 'll say nae mair aboot it .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 30]: My laddie 's nane the waur for ' t noo ; and I hope ye will mak a man o ' him some day , as ye say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 16]: `` He translated a passage of Virgil to-day in a manner that surprised me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 5]: `` Did he though ?
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 38]: He 's not a dunce , I know ; and if it were n't for that stupid boat he and William Macwha are building , he might be made a scholar of , I should n't wonder .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 15]: George should have more sense than encourage such a waste of time and money .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 46]: He 's always wanting something or other for the boat , and I confess I ca n't find in my heart to refuse him , for , whatever he may be at school , he 's a good boy at home , Mr Malison . ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 37]: But the schoolmaster did not reply at once , for a light had dawned upon him : this then was the secret of Alec 's translation -- a secret in good sooth worth his finding out .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 31]: One can hardly believe that it should have been to the schoolmaster the first revelation of the fact that a practical interest is the strongest incitement to a theoretical acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 6]: But such was the case .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 48]: He answered after a moment 's pause -- `` I suspect , ma'am , on the contrary , that the boat , of which I had heard nothing till now , was Alec 's private tutor in the passage of Virgil to which I have referred . ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 11]: `` I do n't understand you , Mr Malison . ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 26]: `` I mean , ma'am , that his interest in his boat made him take an interest in those lines about ships and their rigging .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 10]: So the boat taught him to translate them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 8]: `` I see , I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 32]: `` And that makes me doubt , ma'am , whether we shall be able to make him learn anything to good purpose that he does not take an interest in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 17]: `` Well , what _ do _ you think he is fit for , Mr Malison ?
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 25]: I should like him to be able to be something else than a farmer , whatever he may settle down to at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 29]: Mrs Forbes thought , whether wisely or not , that as long as she was able to manage the farm , Alec might as well be otherwise employed .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 10]: And she had ambition for her son as well .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 11]: But the master was able to make no definite suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 28]: Alec seemed to have no special qualification for any profession ; for the mechanical and constructive faculties had alone reached a notable development in him as yet .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 27]: So after a long talk , his mother and the schoolmaster had come no nearer than before to a determination of what he was fit for .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 12]: The interview , however , restored a good understanding between them .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 13]: It was upon a Friday night that the frost finally broke up .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 11]: A day of wintry rain followed , dreary and depressing .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 32]: But the two boys , Alec Forbes and Willie Macwha , had a refuge from the _ ennui _ commonly attendant on such weather , in the prosecution of their boat-building .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 39]: Hence it came to pass that in the early evening of the following Saturday , they found themselves in close consultation in George Macwha 's shop , upon a doubtful point involved in the resumption of their labour .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 77]: But they could not settle the matter without reference to the master of the mystery , George himself , and were , in the mean time , busy getting their tools in order -- when he entered , in conversation with Thomas Crann the mason , who , his bodily labours being quite interrupted by the rain , had the more leisure apparently to bring his mental powers to bear upon the condition of his neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 53]: `` It 's a sod pity , George , '' he was saying as he entered , `` that a man like you wadna , ance for a ' , tak thoucht a bit , and consider the en ' o ' a ' thing that the sun shines upo ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 15]: `` Hoo do ye ken , Thamas , that I dinna tak thoucht ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 16]: `` Will ye say ` at ye _ div _ tak thoucht , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 52]: `` I 'm a bit o ' a Protestant , though I 'm nae missionar ; an ' I 'm no inclined to confess , Thamas -- meanin ' no ill-will to _ you _ for a ' that , ye ken , '' added George , in a conciliatory tone .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 5]: `` Weel , weel .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 21]: I can only say that I hae seen no signs o ' a savin ' seriousness aboot ye , George .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 12]: Ye 're sair ta'en up wi ' the warl ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 8]: `` Hoo mak ' ye that oot ?
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 13]: Ye big hooses , an ' I mak ' doors to them .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 18]: And they 'll baith stan ' efter you an ' me 's laid i ' the mouls .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 23]: -- It 's weel kent forbye that ye hae a bit siller i ' the bank , and I hae none . ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 9]: `` Not a bawbee hae I , George .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 35]: I can pray for my daily breid wi ' an honest hert ; for gin the Lord dinna sen ' ` t , I hae nae bank to fa ' back upo ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 15]: `` I 'm sorry to hear ` t , Thamas , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 8]: -- `` But Guid guide 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 21]: he exclaimed , `` there 's the twa laddies , hearkenin ' to ilka word ` at we say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 17]: He hoped thus , but hoped in vain , to turn the current of the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 9]: `` A ' the better for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 3]: persisted Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 24]: `` They need to be remi n't as well as you and me , that the fashion o ' this warld passeth away .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 25]: Alec , man , Willie , my lad , can ye big a boat to tak ' ye ower the river o ' Deith ?
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 10]: -- Na , ye 'll no can do that .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 10]: Ye maun gae through that watshod , I doobt !
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 36]: But there 's an ark o ' the Covenant that 'll carry ye safe ower that and a waur flood to boot -- and that 's the flood o ' God 's wrath against evil-doers .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 17]: -- ` Upon the wicked he shall rain fire and brimstone -- a furious tempest . '
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 23]: -- We had a gran ' sermon upo ' the ark o ' the Covenant frae young Mr Mirky last Sabbath nicht .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 21]: What for will na ye come and hear the Gospel for ance and awa ' at least , George Macwha ?
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 9]: Ye can sit i ' my seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 22]: `` I 'm obleeged to ye , '' answered George ; `` but the muckle kirk does weel eneuch for me .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 12]: And ye ken I 'm precentor , noo , forbye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 6]: `` The muckle kirk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 9]: repeated Thomas , in a tone of contempt .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 35]: `` What get ye there but the dry banes o ' morality , upo ' which the win ' o ' the word has never blawn to pit life into the puir disjaskit skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 22]: Come ye to oor kirk , an ' ye 'll get a rousin ' , I can tell ye , man .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 15]: man , gin ye war ance convertit , ye wad ken hoo to sing .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 14]: It 's no great singin ' ` at _ ye _ guide . ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 31]: Before the conversation had reached this point another listener had arrived : the blue eyes of Annie Anderson were fixed upon the speaker from over the half-door of the workshop .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 46]: The drip from the thatch-eaves was dropping upon her shabby little shawl as she stood , but she was utterly heedless of it in the absorption of hearkening to Thomas Crann , who talked with authority , and a kind of hard eloquence of persuasion .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 41]: I ought to explain here that the _ muckle kirk _ meant the parish church ; and that the religious community to which Thomas Crann belonged was one of the first results of the propagation of English Independency in Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 41]: These Independents went commonly by the name of _ Missionars _ in all that district ; a name arising apparently from the fact that they were the first in the neighbourhood to advocate the sending of missionaries to the heathen .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 15]: The epithet was , however , always used with a considerable admixture of contempt .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 17]: `` Are ye no gaein to get a minister o ' yer ain , Thamas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 33]: resumed George , after a pause , still wishing to turn the cart-wheels of the conversation out of the deep ruts in which the stiff-necked Thomas seemed determined to keep them moving .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 14]: `` Na ; we 'll bide a bit , and try the speerits .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 66]: We 're no like you -- forced to lat ower -LRB- swallow -RRB- ony jabble o ' lukewarm water that 's been stan ` in ' i ' the sun frae year 's en ' to year 's en ' , jist because the p tron pleases to stick a pump intil ' t an ' ca ' ' t a well o ' salvation .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 9]: We 'll ken whaur the water comes frae .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 13]: We 'll taste them a ' , and cheese accordin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 14]: `` Weel , I wadna like the trouble nor yet the responsibility . ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 6]: `` I daursay not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 3]: `` Na .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 35]: Nor yet the shame o ' pretennin ' to jeedge my betters , '' added George , now a little nettled , as was generally the result at last of Thomas 's sarcastic tone .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 22]: `` George , '' said Thomas solemnly , `` nane but them that has the speerit can ken the speerit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 27]: With these words , he turned and strode slowly and gloomily out of the shop -- no doubt from dissatisfaction with the result of his attempt .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 19]: Who does not see that Thomas had a hold of something to which George was altogether a stranger ?
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 54]: Surely it is something more to stand with Moses upon Mount Sinai , and see the back of God through ever so many folds of cloudy darkness , than be sitting down to eat and drink , or rising up to play about the golden calf , at the foot of the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 38]: And that Thomas was possessed of some divine secret , the heart of child Annie was perfectly convinced ; the tone of his utterance having a greater share in producing this conviction than anything he had said .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 50]: As he passed out , she looked up reverently at him , as one to whom deep things lay open , Thomas had a kind of gruff gentleness towards children which they found very attractive ; and this meek maiden he could not threaten with the vials of wrath .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 29]: He laid his hard heavy hand kindly on her head , saying : `` Ye 'll be ane o ' the Lord 's lambs , will ye no ?
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 14]: Ye 'll gang into the fold efter him , will ye no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 21]: `` Ay will I , '' answered Annie , `` gin He 'll lat in Alec and Curly too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 25]: `` Ye maun mak nae bargains wi ' him ; but gin they 'll gang in , he 'll no haud them oot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 36]: And away , somewhat comforted , the honest stonemason strode , through the darkness and the rain , to his own rather cheerless home , where he had neither wife nor child to welcome him .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 24]: An elderly woman took care of his house , whose habitual attitude towards him was one half of awe and half of resistance .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 40]: The moment he entered , she left the room where she had been sitting , without a word of welcome , and betook herself to the kitchen , where she prepared his plate of porridge or bowl of brose .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 30]: With this in one hand , and a jug of milk in the other , she soon returned , placing them like a peace-offering on the table before him .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 24]: Having completed the arrangement by the addition of a horn spoon from a cupboard in the wall , she again retired in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 31]: The moment she vanished Thomas 's blue bonnet was thrown into a corner , and with folded hands and bent head he prayed a silent prayer over his homely meal .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 23]: By this time Alec and Curly , having received sufficient instruction from George Macwha , were in full swing with their boat-building .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 35]: But the moment Thomas went , Alec , had taken Annie to the forge to get her well-dried , before he would allow her to occupy her old place in the heap of spales .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 14]: `` Wha 's preachin ' at the missionar-kirk the morn , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 16]: asked the boy 's father , For Willie knew everything that took place in Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 8]: `` Mr Broon , '' answered Curly .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 16]: `` He 's a guid man that , ony gait , '' returned his father .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 8]: `` There 's nae mony like him .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 26]: I think I 'll turn missionar mysel ' , for ance and awa ' , and gang and hear him the morn 's nicht . ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 26]: At the same instant Annie entered the shop , her face glowing with the heat of the forge and the pleasure of rejoining her friends .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 15]: Her appearance turned the current , and no more was said about the missionar-kirk .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 38]: -- Many minutes did not pass before she had begun to repeat to the eager listeners one of the two new poems which she had got ready for them from the book Miss Cowie had lent her .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 29]: Whatever effect the remonstrances of Thomas might or might not have upon the rest , Annie had heard enough to make her want to go to the missionar-kirk .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 16]: For was it not plain that Thomas Crann knew something that she did not know ?
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 13]: and where could he have learned it but at the said kirk ?
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 11]: There must be something going on there worth looking into .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 50]: Perhaps there she might learn just what she needed to know ; for , happy as she was , she would have been much happier had it not been for a something -- she could neither describe nor understand it -- which always rose between her and the happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 25]: She did not lay the blame on circumstances , though they might well , in her case , have borne a part of it .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 18]: Whatever was , to her was right ; and she never dreamed of rebelling against her position .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 40]: For she was one of those simple creatures who perceive at once that if they are to set anything right for themselves or other people , they must begin with their own selves , their inward being and life .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 71]: So without knowing that George Macwha intended to be there , with no expectation of seeing Alec or Curly , and without having consulted any of the Bruce family , she found herself , a few minutes after the service had commenced , timidly peering through the inner door of the chapel , and starting back , with mingled shyness and awe , from the wide solemnity of the place .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 23]: Every eye seemed to have darted upon her the moment she made a chink of light between the door and its post .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 27]: How spiritually does every child-nature feel the solemnity of the place where people , of whatever belief or whatever intellectual rank , meet to worship God !
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 18]: The air of the temple belongs to the poorest meeting-room as much as to the grandest cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 69]: And what added to the effect on Annie was , that the reputation of Mr Brown having drawn a great congregation to hear him preach that evening , she , peeping through the door , saw nothing but live faces ; whereas Mr Cowie 's church , to which she was in the habit of going , though much larger , was only so much the more empty .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 51]: She withdrew in dismay to go up into the gallery , where , entering from behind , she would see fewer faces , and might creep unperceived into the shelter of a pew ; for she felt `` little better than one of the wicked '' in having arrived late .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 30]: So she stole up the awful stair and into the wide gallery , as a chidden dog might steal across the room to creep under the master 's table .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 42]: Not daring to look up , she went with noiseless difficulty down a steep step or two , and perched herself timidly on the edge of a seat , beside an old lady , who had kindly made room for her .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 20]: When she ventured to lift her eyes , she found herself in the middle of a sea of heads .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 25]: But she saw in the same glance that no one was taking any notice of her , which discovery acted wonderfully as a restorative .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 32]: The minister was reading , in a solemn voice , a terrible chapter of denunciation out of the prophet Isaiah , and Annie was soon seized with a deep listening awe .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 66]: The severity of the chapter was , however , considerably mollified by the gentleness of the old lady , who put into her hand a Bible , smelling sweetly of dried starry leaves and southernwood , in which Annie followed the reading word for word , feeling sadly condemned if she happened to allow her eyes to wander for a single moment from the book .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 70]: After the long prayer , during which they all stood -- a posture certainly more reverential than the sitting which so commonly passes for kneeling -- and the long psalm , during which they all sat , the sermon began ; and again for a moment Annie ventured to look up , feeling protected from behind by the back of the pew , which reached high above her head .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 62]: Before her she saw no face but that of the minister , between which and her , beyond the front of the gallery , lay a gulfy space , where , down in the bottom , sat other listening souls , with upturned faces and eyes , unseen of Annie , all their regards converging upon the countenance of the minister .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 60]: He was a thin-faced cadaverous man , with a self-severe saintly look , one to whom religion was clearly a reality , though not so clearly a gladness , one whose opinions vague half-monstrous embodiments of truth -- helped to give him a consciousness of the life which sprung from a source far deeper than his consciousness could reach .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 45]: I wonder if one will ever be able to understand the worship of his childhood -- that revering upward look which must have been founded on a reality , however much after experience may have shown the supposed grounds of reverence to be untenable .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 26]: The moment Annie looked in the face of Mr Brown , she submitted absolutely ; she enshrined him and worshipped him with an awful reverence .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 15]: Nor to the end of her days did she lose this feeling towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 45]: True , she came to see that he was a man of ordinary stature , and that some of the religious views which he held in common with his brethren were dishonouring of God , and therefore could not be elevating to the creature .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 31]: But when she saw these and other like facts , they gave her no shock -- they left the reflex of the man in her mind still unspotted , unimpaired .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 5]: How could this be ?
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 53]: Simply because they left unaltered the conviction that this man believed in God , and that the desire of his own heart brought him into some real , however undefinable , relation to him who was yet nearer to him than that desire itself , and whose presence had caused its birth .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 29]: He chose for his text these words of the Psalmist : `` The wicked shall be turned into hell , and all the nations that forget God . ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 32]: His sermon was less ponderous in construction and multitudinous in division than usual ; for it consisted simply of answers to the two questions : `` Who are the wicked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 8]: and `` What is their fate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 32]: The answer to the former question was , `` The wicked are those that forget God ; '' the answer to the latter , `` The torments of everlasting fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 25]: Upon Annie the sermon produced the immediate conviction that she was one of the wicked , and that she was in danger of hell-fire .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 52]: The distress generated by the earlier part of the sermon , however , like that occasioned by the chapter of prophecy , was considerably mitigated by the kindness of an unknown hand , which , appearing occasionally over her shoulder from behind , kept up a counteractive ministration of peppermint lozenges .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 64]: But the representations grew so much in horror as the sermon approached its end , that , when at last it was over , and Annie drew one long breath of exhaustion , hardly of relief , she became aware that the peppermint lozenge which had been given her a quarter of an hour before , was lying still undissolved in her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 55]: What had added considerably to the effect of the preacher 's words , was that , in the middle of the sermon , she had , all at once , caught sight of the face of George Macwha diagonally opposite to her , his eyes looking like ears with the intensity of his listening .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 24]: Nor did the rather comical episode of the snuffing of the candles in the least interfere with the solemnity of the tragic whole .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 50]: The gallery was lighted by three _ coron _ of tallow candles , which , persisting in growing long-nosed and dim-sighted , had , at varying periods , according as the necessity revealed itself to a certain half-witted individual of the congregation , to be _ snodded _ laboriously .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 15]: Without losing a word that the preacher uttered , Annie watched the process intently .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 88]: What made it ludicrous was , that the man , having taken up his weapon with the air of a pious executioner , and having tipped the chandelier towards him , began , from the operation of some occult sympathy , to open the snuffers and his own mouth simultaneously ; and by the time the black devouring jaws of the snuffers had reached their full stretch , his own jaws had become something dragonlike and hideous to behold -- when both shut with a convulsive snap .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 65]: Add to this that he was long-sighted and often missed a candle several times before he succeeded in snuffing it , whereupon the whole of the opening and shutting process had to be repeated , sometimes with no other result than that of snuffing the candle out , which had then to be pulled from its socket and applied to the next for re-illumination .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 65]: But nothing could be farther from Annie 's mood than a laugh or even a smile , though she gazed as if she were fascinated by the snuffers , which were dreadfully like one of the demons in a wood-cut of the Valley of the Shadow of Death in the _ Pilgrim 's Progress _ without boards , which had belonged to her father .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 33]: When all had ceased -- when the prayer , the singing , and the final benediction were over , Annie crept out into the dark street as if into the Outer Darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 28]: She felt the rain falling upon something hot , but she hardly knew that it was her own cheeks that were being wetted by the heavy drops .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 29]: Her first impulse was to run to Alec and Curly , put her arms about their necks , and entreat them to flee from the wrath to come .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 8]: But she could not find them to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 5]: She must go home .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 59]: For herself she was not much afraid ; for there was a place where prayer was heard as certainly as at the mercy-seat of old -- a little garret room namely , with holes in the floor , out of which came rats ; but with a door as well , in at which came the prayed-for cat .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 9]: But alas for poor Annie and her chapel-going !
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 50]: As she was creeping slowly up from step to step in the dark , the feeling came over her that it was no longer against rats , nor yet against evil things dwelling in the holes and corners of a neglected human world , that she had to pray .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 26]: A spiritual terror was seated on the throne of the universe , and was called God -- and to whom should she pray against it ?
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 9]: Amidst the darkness , a deeper darkness fell .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 26]: She knelt by her bedside , but she could not lift up her heart ; for was she not one of them that forget God ?
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 7]: and was she not therefore wicked ?
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 10]: and was not God angry with her every day ?
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 28]: Was not the fact that she could not pray a certain proof that she was out of God 's favour , and counted unworthy of his notice ?
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 12]: But there was Jesus Christ : she would cry to him .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 7]: But did she believe in him ?
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 29]: She tried hard to convince herself that she did ; but at last she laid her weary head on the bed , and groaned in her young despair .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 18]: At the moment a rustling in the darkness broke the sad silence with a throb of terror .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 6]: She started to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 25]: She was exposed to all the rats in the universe now , for God was angry with her , and she could not pray .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 22]: With a stifled scream she darted to the door , and half tumbled down the stair in an agony of fear .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 19]: `` What gars ye mak sic a din i ' the hoose o ' the Sawbath nicht ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 4]: screamed Mrs Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 8]: But little did Annie feel the reproof .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 29]: And as little did she know that the dreaded rats had this time been the messengers of God to drive her from a path in which lies madness .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 31]: She was forced at length to go to bed , where God made her sleep and forget him , and the rats did not come near her again that night .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 26]: Curly and Alec had been in the chapel too , but they were not of a temperament to be disturbed by Mr Brown 's discourse .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 47]: Little as Murdoch Malison knew of the worlds of thought and feeling -- Annie 's among the rest -- which lay within those young faces and forms assembled the next day as usual , he knew almost as little of the mysteries that lay within himself .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 14]: Annie was haunted all day with the thought of the wrath of God .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 27]: When she forgot it for a moment , it would return again with a sting of actual physical pain , which seemed to pierce her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 14]: Before school was over she had made up her mind what to do .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 32]: And before school was over Malison 's own deed had opened his own eyes , had broken through the crust that lay between him and the vision of his own character .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 24]: There is not to be found a more thorough impersonation of his own theology than a Scotch schoolmaster of the rough old-fashioned type .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 23]: His pleasure was law , irrespective of right or wrong , and the reward of submission to law was immunity from punishment .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 28]: He had his favourites in various degrees , whom he chose according to inexplicable directions of feeling ratified by `` the freedom of his own will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 25]: These found it easy to please him , while those with whom he was not primarily pleased , found it impossible to please him .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 46]: Now there had come to the school , about a fortnight before , two unhappy-looking little twin orphans , with white thin faces , and bones in their clothes instead of legs and arms , committed to the mercies of Mr Malison by their grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 85]: Bent into all the angles of a grasshopper , and lean with ancient poverty , the old man tottered away with his stick in one hand , stretched far out to support his stooping frame , and carried in the other the caps of the two forsaken urchins , saying , as he went , in a quavering , croaking voice , `` I 'll jist tak them wi ' me , or they 'll no be fit for the Sawbath aboon a fortnicht .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 13]: They 're terrible laddies to blaud -LRB- spoil -RRB- their claes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 40]: Turning with difficulty when he had reached the door , he added : `` Noo ye jist gie them their whups weel , Master Mailison , for ye ken that he that spareth the rod blaudeth the bairn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 14]: Thus authorized , Malison certainly did `` gie them their whups weel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 20]: Before the day was over they had both lain shrieking on the floor under the torture of the lash .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 41]: And such poor half-clothed , half-fed creatures they were , and looked so pitiful and cowed , that one can not help thinking it must have been for his own glory rather than their good that he treated them thus .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 35]: But , in justice to Malison , another fact must be mentioned , which , although inconsistent with the one just recorded , was in perfect consistency with the theological subsoil whence both sprang .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 28]: After about a week , during which they had been whipt almost every day , the orphans came to school with a cold and a terrible cough .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 30]: Then his observant pupils saw the man who was both cruel judge and cruel executioner , feeding his victims with liquorice till their faces were stained with its exuberance .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 34]: The old habits of severity , which had been in some measure intermitted , had returned upon him with gathered strength , and this day Anne was to be one of the victims .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 62]: For although he would not dare to whip her , he was about to incur the shame of making this day , pervaded as it was , through all its spaces of time and light , with the fumes of the sermon she had heard the night before , the most wretched day that Anne 's sad life had yet seen .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 21]: Indeed , although she afterwards passed many more sorrowful days , she never had to pass one so utterly miserable .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 25]: The spirits of the pit seemed to have broken loose and filled Murdoch Malison 's school-room with the stench of their fire and brimstone .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 41]: As she sat longing for school to be over , that she might follow a plan which had a glimmer of hope in it , stupified with her labouring thoughts , and overcome with wretchedness , she fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 24]: She was roused by a smart blow from the taws , flung with unerring aim at the back of her bare bended neck .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 28]: She sprang up with a cry , and , tottering between sleep and terror , proceeded at once to take the leather snake back to the master .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 19]: But she would have fallen in getting over the form had not Alec caught her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 20]: He re-seated her , and taking the taws from her trembling hand , carried it himself to the tyrant .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 27]: Upon him Malison 's fury , breaking loose , expended itself in a dozen blows on the right hand , which Alec held up without flinching .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 37]: As he walked to his seat , burning with pain , the voice of the master sounded behind him ; but with the decree it uttered , Alec did not feel himself at liberty to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 16]: `` Ann Anderson , '' he bawled , `` stand up on the seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 7]: With trembling limbs , Annie obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 14]: She could scarcely stand at first , and the form shook beneath her .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 21]: For some time her colour kept alternating between crimson and white , but at last settled into a deadly pallor .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 25]: Indeed , it was to her a terrible punishment to be exposed to the looks of all the boys and girls in the school .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 51]: The elder Bruce tried hard to make her see one of his vile grimaces , but , feeling as if every nerve in her body were being stung with eyes , she never dared to look away from the book which she held upside down before her own sightless eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 32]: -- This pillory was the punishment due to falling asleep , as hell was the punishment for forgetting God ; and there she had to stand for a whole hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 5]: _ What a shame !
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 4]: Damn that Malison !
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 59]: _ '' and various other subdued exclamations were murmured about the room ; for Annie was a favourite with most of the boys , and yet more because she was the General 's sweetheart , as they said ; but these ebullitions of popular feeling were too faint to reach her ears and comfort her isolation and exposure .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 41]: Worst of all , she had soon to behold , with every advantage of position , an outbreak of the master 's temper , far more painful than she had yet seen , both from its cruelty and its consequences .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 36]: A small class of mere children , amongst whom were the orphan Truffeys , had been committed to the care of one of the bigger boys , while the master was engaged with another class .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 42]: Every boy in the latter had already had his share of _ pandies _ , when a noise in the children 's class attracting the master 's attention , he saw one of the Truffeys hit another boy in the face .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 36]: He strode upon him at once , and putting no question as to provocation , took him by the neck , fixed it between his knees , and began to lash him with hissing blows .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 34]: In his agony , the little fellow contrived to twist his head about and get a mouthful of the master 's leg , inserting his teeth in a most canine and praiseworthy manner .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 13]: The master caught him up , and dashed him on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 6]: There the child lay motionless .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 12]: Alarmed , and consequently cooled , Malison proceeded to lift him .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 13]: He was apparently lifeless ; but he had only fainted with pain .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 17]: When he came to himself a little , it was found that his leg was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 10]: It appeared afterwards that the knee-cap was greatly injured .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 17]: Moaning with pain , he was sent home on the back of a big parish scholar .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 11]: At all this Anne stared from her pillory with horror .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 33]: The feeling that God was angry with her grew upon her ; and Murdoch Malison became for a time inseparably associated with her idea of God , frightfully bewildering all her aspirations .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 23]: The master still looked uneasy , threw the _ tag _ into his desk , and beat no one more that day .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 11]: Indeed , only half an hour of school-time was left .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 21]: As soon as that was over , he set off at a swinging pace for the old grandfather 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 7]: What passed there was never known .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 23]: The other Truffey came to school the next day as usual , and told the boys that his brother was in bed .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 19]: In that bed he lay for many weeks , and many were the visits the master paid him .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 12]: This did much with the townsfolk to wipe away his reproach .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 20]: They spoke of the affair as an unfortunate accident , and pitied the schoolmaster even more than the sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 40]: When at length the poor boy was able to leave his bed , it became apparent that , either through unskilful treatment , or as the unavoidable result of the injury , he would be a cripple for life .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 26]: The master 's general behaviour was certainly modified by this consequence of his fury ; but it was some time before the full reaction arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 37]: When Annie descended from her hateful eminence , just before the final prayer , it was with a deeper sense of degradation than any violence of the tawse on her poor little hands could have produced .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 49]: Nor could the attentions of Alec , anxiously offered as soon as they were out of school , reach half so far to console her as they might once have reached ; for such was her sense of condemnation , that she dared not take pleasure in anything .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 12]: Nothing else was worth minding till something was done about that .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 14]: The thought of having God against her took the heart out of everything .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 28]: -- As soon as Alec left her , she walked with hanging head , pale face , and mournful eyes , straight to Mr Cowie 's door .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 66]: She was admitted at once , and shown into the library , where the clergyman sat in the red dusky glow of the firelight , sipping a glass of wine , and looking very much like an ox-animal chewing the cud ; for the meditation in which the good man indulged over his wine was seldom worthy of being characterized otherwise than as mental rumination .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 23]: `` Well , Annie , my dear , come away , '' said he , `` I am glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 8]: How does the boat get on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 22]: Deeply touched by a kindness which fell like dew upon the parching misery of the day , Annie burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 6]: Mr Cowie was greatly distressed .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 29]: He drew her between his knees , laid his cheek against hers , as was his way with children , and said with soothing tenderness : `` Walawa !
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 9]: what 's the matter with my dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 28]: After some vain attempts at speech , Annie succeeded in giving the following account of the matter , much interrupted with sobs and fresh outbursts of weeping .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 19]: `` Ye see , sir , I gaed last nicht to the missionar kirk to hear Mr Broon .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 10]: And he preached a gran ' sermon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 13]: But I haena been able to bide mysel ' sin ' syne .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 36]: For I doobt I 'm ane o ' the wicked ` at God hates , and I 'll never win ' to haven at a ' , for I canna help forgettin ' him whiles .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 19]: An ' the wicked 'll be turned into hell , and a ' the nations that forget God .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 7]: That was his text , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 7]: And I canna bide it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 27]: In the bosom of the good man rose a gentle indignation against the schismatics who had thus terrified and bewildered that sacred being , a maid-child .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 6]: But what could he say ?
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 19]: He thought for a moment , and betook himself , in his perplexity , to his common sense .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 14]: `` You have n't forgotten your father , have you , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 13]: `` I think aboot him maist ilka day , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 23]: `` But there comes a day now and then when you do n't think much about him , does there not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 36]: `` Do you think he would be angry with his child because she was so much taken up with her books or her play -- '' `` I never play at onything , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 42]: `` Well -- with learning songs to say to Alec Forbes and Willie Macwha -- do you think he would be angry that you did n't think about him that day , especially when you ca n't see him ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 6]: ` Deed no , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 12]: He wadna be sae sair upo ' me as that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 11]: `` What would he say , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 22]: `` Gin Mr Bruce war to cast it up till me , he wad say : ` Lat alane the lassie .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 13]: She 'll think aboot me the morn -- time eneuch . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 17]: `` Well , do n't you think your Father in heaven would say the same ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 7]: `` Maybe he micht , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 21]: But ye see my father was my ain father , and wad mak ' the best o ' me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 11]: `` And is not God kinder than your father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 9]: `` He canna weel be that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 7]: And there 's the Scripter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 13]: `` But he sent his only Son to die for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 15]: `` Ay -- for the eleck , sir , '' returned the little theologian .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 49]: Now this was more than Mr Cowie was well prepared to meet , for certainly this terrible doctrine was perfectly developed in the creed of the Scotch Church ; the assembly of divines having sat upon the Scripture egg till they had hatched it in their own likeness .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 4]: Poor Mr Cowie !
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 19]: There were the girl-eyes , blue , and hazy with tearful questions , looking up at him hungrily .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 8]: -- O starving little brothers and sisters !
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 16]: God does love you , and all shall be , and therefore is , well .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 50]: -- But the minister could not say this , gladly as he would have said it if he could ; and the only result of his efforts to find a suitable reply was that he lost his temper -- not with Annie , but with the doctrine of election .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 32]: `` Gang ye hame , Annie , my bairn , '' said he , talking Scotch now , `` and dinna trouble yer heid about election , and a ' that .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 8]: It 's no ' a canny doctrine .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 45]: No mortal man could ever win at the boddom o ' ` t. I 'm thinkin ' we haena muckle to do w ' ` t. Gang hame , dawtie , and say yer prayers to be preserved frae the wiles o ' Sawtan .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 8]: There 's a sixpence to ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 14]: His kind heart was sorely grieved that all it could give was money .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 21]: She had asked for bread , and he had but a stone , as he thought , to give her .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 8]: So he gave it her with shame .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 37]: He might however have reversed the words of St Peter , saying , `` Spiritual aid I have none , but such as I have give I thee ; '' and so offered her the sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 53]: But , for my part , I think the sixpence had more of bread in it than any theology he might have been expected to have at hand ; for , so given , it was the symbol and the sign of love , which is the heart of the divine theology .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 19]: Annie , however , had a certain Scotchness in her which made her draw back from the offer .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 19]: `` Na , thank ye , sir , '' she said ; `` I dinna want it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 16]: `` Will ye no tak ' it to please an auld man , bairn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 20]: `` Deed will I , sir , I wad do a hantle mair nor that to please you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 39]: And again the tears filled her blue eyes as she held out her hand -- receiving in it a shilling which Mr Cowie , for more relief to his own burdened heart , had substituted for the sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 10]: `` It 's a shillin ' , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 16]: she said , looking up at him with the coin lying on her open palm .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 7]: `` Weel , what for no ?
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 9]: Is a shillin ' no a saxpence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 5]: `` Ay , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 5]: It 's twa . ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 47]: `` Weel , Annie , '' said the old man , suddenly elevated into prophecy for the child 's need -- for he had premeditated nothing of the sort -- `` maybe whan God offers us a saxpence , it may turn oot to be twa .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 7]: Good nicht , my bairn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 9]: But Mr Cowie was sorely dissatisfied with himself .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 31]: For not only did he perceive that the heart of the child could not be thus satisfied , but he began to feel something new stirring in his own bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 12]: The fact was that Annie was further on than Mr Cowie .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 61]: She was a child looking about to find the face of her Father in heaven : he was but one of God 's babies , who had been lying on his knees , receiving contentedly and happily the good things he gave him , but never looking up to find the eyes of him from whom the good gifts came .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 49]: And now the heart of the old man , touched by the motion of the child 's heart -- yearning after her Father in heaven , and yet scarcely believing that he could be so good as her father on earth -- began to stir uneasily within him .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 15]: And he went down on his knees and hid his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 11]: But Annie , though not satisfied , went away comforted .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 20]: After such a day of agony and humiliation , Mr Cowie 's kiss came gracious with restoration and blessing .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 14]: It had something in it which was not in Mr Brown 's sermon .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 84]: And yet if she had gone to Mr Brown , she would have found him kind too -- very kind ; but solemnly kind -- severely kind ; his long saintly face beaming with religious tenderness -- not human cordiality ; and his heart full of interest in her spiritual condition , not sympathy with the unhappiness which his own teaching had produced ; nay , rather inclined to gloat over this unhappiness as the sign of grace bestowed and an awakening conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 18]: But notwithstanding the comfort Mr Cowie had given her -- the best he had , poor man !
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 8]: -- Annie 's distress soon awoke again .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 61]: To know that she could not be near God in peace and love without fulfilling certain mental conditions -- that he would not have her just as she was now , filled her with an undefined but terribly real misery , only the more distressing that it was vague with the vagueness of the dismal negation from which it sprung .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 23]: It was not however the strength of her love to God that made her unhappy in being thus barred out from him .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 31]: It was rather the check thus given to the whole upward tendency of her being , with its multitude of undefined hopes and longings now drawing nigh to the birth .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 16]: It was in her ideal self rather than her conscious self that her misery arose .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 22]: And now , dearly as she loved Mr Cowie , she began to doubt whether he knew much about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 31]: He had put her off without answering her questions , either because he thought she had no business with such things , or because he had no answer to give .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 30]: This latter possibly added not a little to her unhappiness , for it gave birth to a fearful doubt as to the final safety of kind Mr Cowie himself .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 29]: But there was one man who knew more about such secret things , she fully believed , than any man alive ; and that man was Thomas Crann .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 26]: Thomas was a rather dreadful man , with his cold eyes , high shoulders , and wheezing breath ; and Annie was afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 43]: But she would have encountered the terrors of the Valley of the Shadow of Death , as surely as the Pilgrim , to get rid of the demon nightmare that lay upon her bosom , crushing the life out of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 23]: So she plucked up courage , like Christian of old , and resolved to set out for the house of the Interpreter .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 25]: Judging , however , that he could not yet be home from his work , she thought it better to go home herself first .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 41]: After eating a bit of oat cake , with a mug of blue milk for _ kitchie _ -LRB- Latin `` obsonium '' -RRB- , she retired to her garret and waited drearily , but did not try to pray .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 35]: It was very dark by the time she left the house , for the night was drizzly ; but she knew the windings of Glamerton almost as well as the way up her garret-stair .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 16]: Thomas 's door was half open , and a light was shining from the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 4]: She knocked timidly .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 30]: At the same moment she heard the voice of Thomas from the other end of this house , which consisted only of a _ but and a ben _ .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 24]: In the ben-end -LRB- the inner originally , hence better room -RRB- there was no light : Thomas often sat in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 13]: `` Jean , come ben to worship , '' he cried roughly .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 10]: `` Comin ' , Thamas , '' answered Jean .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 9]: Again Annie knocked , but again without result .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 6]: Her knock was too gentle .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 44]: After a moment 's pause , dreading that the intended prayers might interfere with her project , she knocked yet again ; but a second time her knock was overwhelmed in the gruff call of Thomas , sounding yet more peremptory than before .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 9]: `` Jean , come ben to worship . ''
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 10]: `` Hoot , Thamas , hae patience , man .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 5]: I canna come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 10]: `` Jean , come ben to worship direckly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 15]: `` I 'm i ' the mids ' o ' cleanin ' the shune .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 12]: I hae dooble wark o ' Mononday , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 7]: `` The shune can bide . ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 6]: `` Worship can bide . ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 5]: `` Haud yer tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 6]: The shune can bide . ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 10]: `` Na , na ; they canna bide . ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 17]: `` Gin ye dinna come ben this minute , I 'll hae worship my lane . ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 56]: Vanquished by the awful threat , Jean dropped the shoe she held , and turned her apron ; but having to pass the door on her way to the ben-end , she saw Annie standing on the threshold , and stopped with a start , ejaculating : `` The Lord preserve 's , lassie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 11]: `` Jean , what are ye sweerin ' at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 5]: cried Thomas , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 10]: `` At Annie Anderson , '' answered Jean simply .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 12]: `` What for are ye sweerin ' at _ her _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 9]: I 'm sure she 's a douce lassie .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 7]: What does the bairn want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 9]: `` What do ye want , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 15]: `` I want to see Thomas , gin ye please , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 32]: `` She wants to see you , Thomas , '' screamed Jean ; remarking in a lower voice , `` He 's as deef 's a door-nail , Annie Anderson . ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 12]: `` Lat her come in , than , '' bawled Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 25]: `` He 's tellin ' ye to come in , Annie , '' said Jean , as if she had been interpreting his words .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 11]: But she detained her nevertheless to ask several unimportant questions .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 17]: At length the voice of Thomas rousing her once more , she hastened to introduce her .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 20]: `` Gang in there , Annie , '' she said , throwing open the door of the dark room .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 16]: The child entered and stood just within it , not knowing even where Thomas sat .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 25]: But a voice came to her out of the gloom : `` Ye 're no feared at the dark , are ye , Annie ?
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 4]: Come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 10]: `` I dinna ken whaur I 'm gaein . ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 6]: `` Never min ' that .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 4]: Come straucht foret .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 7]: I 'm watchin ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 96]: For Thomas had been sitting in the dark till he could see in it -LRB- which , however , is not an invariable result -RRB- , while out of the little light Annie had come into none at all But she obeyed the voice , and went straight forward into the dark , evidently much to the satisfaction of Thomas , who seizing her arm with one hand , laid the other , horny and heavy , on her head , saying : `` Noo , my lass , ye 'll ken what faith means .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 13]: Whan God tells ye to gang into the mirk , gang ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 12]: `` But I dinna like the mirk , '' said Annie .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 12]: `` No human sowl _ can _ , '' responded Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 11]: `` Jean , fess a can ` le direckly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 35]: Now Thomas was an enemy to everything that could be , justly or unjustly , called _ superstition _ ; and this therefore was not the answer that might have been expected of him .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 54]: But he had begun with the symbolic and mystical in his reception of Annie , and perhaps there was something in the lovely childishness of her unconscious faith -LRB- while she all the time thought herself a dreadful unbeliever -RRB- that kept Thomas to the simplicities of the mystical part of his nature .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 12]: Besides , Thomas 's mind was a rendezvous for all extremes .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 16]: In him they met , and showed that they met by fighting all day long .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 33]: If you knocked at his inner door , you never could tell what would open it to you -- all depending on what happened to be _ uppermost _ in the wrestle .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 20]: The candle was brought and set on the table , showing two or three geranium plants in the window .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 23]: Why her eyes should have fixed upon these , Annie tried to discover afterwards , when she was more used to thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 53]: But she could not tell , except it were that they were so scraggy and wretched , half drowned in the darkness , and half blanched by the miserable light , and therefore must have been very like her own feelings , as she stood before the ungentle but not unkind stone-mason .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 24]: `` Weel , lassie , '' said he , when Jean had retired , `` what do ye want wi ' me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 6]: Annie burst into tears again .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 26]: `` Jean , gae butt the hoose direckly , '' cried Thomas , on the mere chance of his attendant having lingered at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 20]: And the sound of her retreating footsteps , though managed with all possible care , immediately justified his suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 20]: This interruption turned Annie 's tears aside , and when Thomas spoke next , she was able to reply .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 17]: `` Noo , my bairn , '' he said , `` what 's the maitter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 14]: `` I was at the missionar kirk last nicht , '' faltered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 10]: And the sermon took a grip o ' ye ?
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 7]: -- Nae doot , nae doot .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 2]: Ay .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 3]: Ay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 13]: `` I canna help forgettin ' _ him _ , Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 13]: `` But ye maun try and no forget him , lassie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 5]: `` Sae I do .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 12]: But it 's dour wark , and ` maist impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 22]: `` Sae it maun aye be ; to the auld Aidam impossible ; to the young Christian a weary watch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 7]: Hope began to dawn upon Annie .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 27]: `` A body micht hae a chance , '' she asked with meditative suggestion , `` allooin ' ` at she did forget him whiles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 6]: `` Nae doot , lassie .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 35]: The nations that forget God are them that dinna care , that never fash their heids , or their herts aither , aboot him -- them that were never called , never chosen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 15]: Annie 's trouble returned like a sea-wave that had only retired to gather strength .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 21]: `` But hoo 's a body to ken whether she _ be _ ane o ' the elec ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 5]: she said , quaking .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 7]: `` That 's a hard maitter .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 11]: It 's no needfu ' to ke n't aforehan ' .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 11]: Jist lat that alane i ' the mean time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 8]: `` But I canna lat it alane .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 11]: It 's no for mysel ' aither a ` thegither .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 11]: Could _ ye _ lat it alane , Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 13]: This home-thrust prevented any questioning about the second clause of her answer .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 7]: And Thomas dearly loved plain dealing .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 8]: `` Ye hae me there , lassie .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 8]: Na , I cudna lat it alane .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 9]: An ' I never did lat it alane .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 15]: I plaguit the Lord nicht an ' day till he loot me ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 22]: `` I tried hard last nicht , '' said Annie , `` but the rottans war ower mony for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 12]: `` Sawtan has mony wiles , '' said the mason reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 9]: `` Do ye think they warna rottans ? '
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 3]: asked Annie .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 3]: `` Ow !

Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 22]: 'Cause , gin I thocht they war only deils , I wadna care a buckie -LRB- periwinkle -RRB- for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 26]: `` It 's muckle the same what ye ca ' them , gin they ca you frae the throne o ' grace , lassie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 11]: `` What am I to do than , Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 21]: `` Ye maun haud at it , lassie , jist as the poor widow did wi ' the unjust judge .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 34]: An ' gin the Lord hears ye , ye 'll ken ye 're ane o ' the elec ' , for it 's only his own elec ' that the Lord dis hear .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 15]: lassie , little ye ken aboot prayin ' an ' no faintin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 17]: Alas for the parable if Thomas 's theories were to be carried out in its exposition !
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 21]: For they would lead to the conclusion that the Lord and the unjust judge were one and the same person .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 18]: But it is our divine aspirations and not our intellectual theories that need to be carried out .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 57]: The latter may , nay must in some measure , perish ; the former will be found in perfect harmony with the divine Will ; yea , true though faint echoes of that Will -- echoes from the unknown caves of our deepest humanity , where lies , yet swathed in darkness , the divine image .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 38]: To Thomas 's words Annie 's only reply was a fixed gaze , which he answered thus , resuming his last words : `` Ay , lassie , little ye ken aboot watchin ' and prayin ' .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 61]: Whan it pleased the Lord to call me , I was stan ` in ' my lane i ' the mids ' o ' a peat-moss , luikin ' wast , whaur the sun had left a reid licht ahin him , as gin he had jist brunt oot o ' the lift , an ' hadna gane doon ava .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 14]: An ' it min 'd me o ' the day o ' jeedgment .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 72]: An ' there I steid and luikit , till the licht itsel ' deid oot , an ' naething was left but a gray sky an ' a feow starns intil ` t. An ' the cloods gethered , an ' the lift grew black an ' mirk ; an ' the haill countryside vainished , till I kent no more aboot it than what my twa feet could answer for .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 29]: An ' I daurna muv for the fear o ' the pits o ' water an ' the walleen -LRB- well-eyes -- quagmire-springs -RRB- on ilka han ' .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 24]: The lee-lang nicht I stood , or lay , or kneeled upo ' my k-nees , cryin ' to the Lord for grace .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 25]: I forgot a ' aboot election , an ' cried jist as gin I could gar him hear me by haudin ' at him .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 26]: An ' i ' the mornin ' , whan the licht cam ' , I faund that my face was to the risin ' sun .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 17]: And I crap oot o ' the bog , an ' hame to my ain hoose .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 36]: An ' ilka body ` at I met o ' the road took the tither side o ' ` t , and glowert at me as gin I had been a ghaist or a warlock .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 21]: An ' the bairns playin ' aboot the doors ran in like rabbits whan they got sicht o ' me .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 51]: An ' I begud to think ` at something fearsome had signed me for a reprobate ; an ' I jist closed my door , and gaed to my bed , and loot my wark stan ' , for wha cud wark wi ' damnation hingin ' ower his heid ?
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 23]: An ' three days gaed ower me , that nothing passed my lips but a drap o ' milk an ' water .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 34]: An ' o ' the fourth day , i ' the efternoon , I gaed to my wark wi ' my heid swimmin ' and my hert like to brak for verra glaidness .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 10]: I _ was _ ane o ' the chosen .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 16]: -LSB- '' -RSB- `` But hoo did ye fin ' that oot , Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 5]: asked Annie , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 55]: `` Weel , lassie , '' answered Thomas , with solemn conviction in every tone , `` it 's my firm belief that , say what they like , there is , and there can be , but _ one _ way o ' comin ' to the knowledge o ' that secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 7]: `` And what 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 12]: entreated Annie , whose life seemed to hang upon his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 4]: `` Jist this .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 11]: Get a sicht o ' the face o ' God .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 45]: -- It 's my belief , an ' a ' the minnisters in creation 'll no gar me alter my min ' , that no man can get a glimp ' o ' the face o ' God but ane o ' the chosen .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 45]: I 'm no sayin ' ` at a man 's no ane o ' the elec ' that hasna had that favour vouchsaufed to _ him _ ; but this I _ do _ say , that he canna ken his election wi'oot that .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 25]: Try ye to get a sicht o ' the face o ' God , lassie : syne ye 'll ken and be at peace .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 11]: Even Moses himsel ' cudna be saitisfeed wi'oot that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 10]: `` What is ' t like , Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 12]: said Annie , with an eagerness which awe made very still .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 7]: `` No words can tell that .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 7]: It 's all in the speerit .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 10]: Whan ye see ' t ye 'll ke n't .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 13]: There 's no fear o ' mistakin ' _ that _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 6]: Teacher and scholar were silent .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 7]: Annie was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 6]: She had gained her quest .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 11]: `` Am I to gang hame noo , Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 12]: `` Ay , gang hame , lassie , to yer prayers .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 7]: But I doobt it 's dark .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 7]: I 'll gang wi ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 7]: -- Jean , my shune ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 15]: `` Na , na ; I could gang hame blinlins , '' remonstrated Annie .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 5]: `` Haud yer tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 10]: I 'm gaein hame wi ' ye , bairn .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 7]: -- Jean , my shune ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 5]: `` Hoot , Thamas !
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 17]: I 've jist cleaned them , '' screeched Jean from the kitchen at the second call .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 6]: `` Fess them here direckly .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 18]: It 's a jeedgment on ye for sayin ' worship cud bide better nor the shune . ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 9]: Janet brought them and put them down sulkily .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 45]: In another minute the great shoes , full of nails half an inch broad , were replaced on the tired feet , and with her soft little hand clasped in the great horny hand of the stonemason , Annie trotted home by his side .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 67]: With Scotch caution , Thomas , as soon as they entered the shop , instead of taking leave of Annie , went up to the counter , and asked for an `` unce o ' tobawco , '' as if his appearance along with Annie were merely accidental ; while Annie , with perfect appreciation of the reticence , ran through the gap in the counter .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 21]: She was so far comforted and so much tired , that she fell asleep at her prayers by the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 6]: Presently she awoke in terror .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 21]: It was Pussy however that had waked her , as she knew by the green eyes lamping in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 18]: But she closed her prayers rather abruptly , clambered into bed , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 28]: And in her sleep she dreamed that she stood in the darkness of the same peat-moss which had held Thomas and his prayers all the night long .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 22]: She thought she was _ kept in _ there , till she should pray enough to get herself out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 12]: And she tried hard to pray , but she could not .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 29]: And she fell down in despair , beset with the terrors of those frightful holes full of black water which she had seen on her way to Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 25]: But a hand came out of the darkness , laid hold of hers , and lifting her up , led her through the bog .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 24]: And she dimly saw the form that led her , and it was that of a man who walked looking upon the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 22]: And she tried to see his face , but she could not , for he walked ever a little before her .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 10]: And he led her home to the old farm .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 11]: And her father came to the door to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 21]: And he looked just the same as in the old happy days , only that his face was strangely bright .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 26]: And with the joy of seeing her father she awoke to a gentle sorrow that she had not seen also the face of her deliverer .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 19]: The next evening she wandered down to George Macwha 's , and found the two boys at work .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 29]: She had no poetry to give them , no stories to tell them , no answer to their questions as to where she had been the night before .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 10]: She could only stand in silence and watch them .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 27]: The skeleton of the boat grew beneath their hands , but it was on the workers and not on their work that her gaze was fixed .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 31]: For her heart was burning within her , and she could hardly restrain herself from throwing her arms about their necks and imploring them to seek the face of God .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 13]: if she only knew that Alec and Curly were of the elect !
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 8]: But they only could find that out .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 12]: There was no way for her to peer into that mystery .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 50]: All she could do was to watch their wants , to have the tool they needed next ready to their hand , to clear away the spales from before the busy plane , and to lie in wait for any chance of putting to her little strength to help .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 8]: Perhaps they were not of the elect !
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 15]: She would minister to them therefore -- oh , how much the more tenderly !
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 8]: `` What 's come ower Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 11]: said the one to the other when she had gone .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 12]: But there was no answer to be found to the question .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 16]: Could they have understood her if she had told them what had come over her ?
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 29]: And so the time went on , slow-paced , with its silent destinies Annie said her prayers , read her Bible , and tried not to forget God .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 41]: could she only have known that God never forgot her , whether she forgot him or not , giving her sleep in her dreary garret , gladness even in Murdoch Malison 's school-room , and the light of life everywhere !
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 31]: He was now leading on the blessed season of spring , when the earth would be almost heaven enough to those who had passed through the fierceness of the winter .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 45]: Even now , the winter , old and weary , was halting away before the sweet approaches of the spring -- a symbol of that eternal spring before whose slow footsteps Death itself , `` the winter of our discontent , '' shall vanish .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 6]: Death alone can die everlastingly .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 27]: I have been diffuse in my account of Annie 's first winter at school , because what impressed her should impress those who read her history .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 17]: It is her reflex of circumstance , in a great measure , which makes that history .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 60]: In regard to this portion of her life , I have little more to say than that by degrees the school became less irksome to her ; that she grew more interested in her work ; that some of the reading-books contained extracts which she could enjoy ; and that a taste for reading began to wake in her .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 28]: If ever she came to school with her lesson unprepared , it was because some book of travel or history had had attractions too strong for her .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 23]: And all that day she would go about like a guilty thing , oppressed by a sense of downfall and neglected duty .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 7]: With Alec it was very different .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 52]: He would often find himself in a similar case ; but the neglect would make no impression on his conscience ; or if it did , he would struggle hard to keep down the sense of dissatisfaction which strove to rise within him , and enjoy himself in spite of it .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 23]: Annie , again , accepted such as her doom , and went about gently unhappy , till neglect was forgotten in performance .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 11]: There is nothing that can wipe out wrong but right .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 24]: And still she haunted George Macwha 's workshop , where the boat soon began to reveal the full grace of its lovely outlines .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 37]: Of all the works of man 's hands , except those that belong to Art , a boat is the loveliest , and , in the old sense of the word , the _ liveliest _ .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 4]: Why is this ?
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 11]: Is it that it is born between Wind and Water ?
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 100]: -- Wind the father , ever casting himself into multitudinous shapes of invisible tides , taking beauteous form in the sweep of a `` lazy-paced cloud , '' or embodying a transient informing freak in the waterspout , which he draws into his life from the bosom of his mate ; -- Water , the mother , visible she , sweeping and swaying , ever making and ever unmade , the very essence of her being -- beauty , yet having no form of her own , and yet again manifesting herself in the ceaseless generation of passing forms ?
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 68]: If the boat be the daughter of these , the stable child of visible and invisible subtlety , made to live in both , and shape its steady course between their varying and conflicting forces -- if her Ideal was modelled between the flap of airy pinions and the long ranging flow of the serpent water , how could the lines of her form fail of grace ?
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 28]: Nor in this case were the magic influences of verse wanting to mould and model a boat which from prow to stern should be lovely and fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 68]: As Pandemonium `` Rose like an exhalation , with the sound Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet , '' so the little boat grew to the sound of Annie 's voice uttering not Runic Rhymes , but old Scotch ballads , or such few sweet English poems , of the new revelation , as floated across her way , and folded their butterfly wings in her memory .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 13]: I have already said that reading became a great delight to her .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 26]: Mr Cowie threw his library , with very little restriction , open to her ; and books old and new were all new to her .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 24]: She carried every fresh one home with a sense of riches and a feeling of _ upliftedness _ which I can ill describe .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 65]: She gloated over the thought of it , as she held it tight in her hand , with feelings resembling , and yet how unlike , those of Johnny Bruce when he crept into his rabbits ' barrel to devour the pennyworth of _ plunky _ -LRB- a preparation of treacle and flour -RRB- which his brother would else have compelled him to share .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 38]: Now that the days were longer , she had plenty of time to read ; for although her so-called guardians made cutting remarks upon her idleness , they had not yet compelled her to nursing or needlework .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 37]: If she had shown the least inclination to either , her liberty would have been gone from that moment ; but , with the fear of James Dow before their eyes , they let her alone .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 33]: As to her doing anything in the shop , she was far too much of an alien to be allowed to minister in the lowliest office of that sacred temple of Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 44]: So she read everything she could lay her hands upon ; and as often as she found anything peculiarly interesting , she would take the book to the boat , where the boys were always ready to listen to whatever she brought them .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 13]: And this habit made her more dircerning -LSB- sic -RSB- and choice .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 19]: Before I leave the school , however , I must give one more scene out of its history .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 66]: One mid-day in spring , just as the last of a hail-shower was passing away , and a sickly sunbeam was struggling out , the schoolroom-door opened , and in came Andrew Truffey , with a smile on his worn face , which shone in touching harmony with the watery gleam of the sun between the two hail-storms -- for another was close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 55]: He swung himself in on the new pivot of his humanity , namely his crutch , which every one who saw him believed at once he was never more to go without , till he sank wearied on the road to the grave , and had to be carried the rest of the way .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 17]: He looked very long and deathly , for he had grown much while lying in bed .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 14]: The master rose hurriedly from his desk , and advanced to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 8]: A deep stillness fell upon the scholars .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 12]: They dropped all their work , and gazed at the meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 7]: The master held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 35]: With awkwardness and difficulty Andrew presented the hand which had been holding the crutch ; and , not yet thoroughly used to the management of it , staggered in consequence and would have fallen .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 19]: But the master caught him in his arms and carried him to his old seat beside his brother .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 44]: `` Thank ye , sir , '' said the boy with another gleamy smile , through which his thin features and pale , prominent eyes told yet more plainly of sad suffering -- all the master 's fault , as the master knew .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 12]: `` Leuk at the dominie , '' said Curly to Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 7]: `` He 's greitin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 24]: For Mr Malison had returned to his seat and had laid his head down on the desk , evidently to hide his emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 7]: `` Haud yer tongue , Curly .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 9]: Dinna leuk at him , '' returned Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 9]: `` He 's sorry for poor Truffey . ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 12]: Every one behaved to the master that day with marked respect .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 11]: And from that day forward Truffey was in universal favour .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 14]: Let me once more assert that Mr Malison was not a bad man .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 89]: The misfortune was , that his notion of right fell in with his natural fierceness ; and that , in aggravation of the too common feeling with which he had commenced his relations with his pupils , namely , that they were not only the natural enemies of the master , but therefore of all law , theology had come in and taught him that they were in their own nature bad -- with a badness for which the only set-off he knew or could introduce was blows .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 49]: Independently of any remedial quality that might be in them , these blows were an embodiment of justice ; for `` every sin , '' as the catechism teaches , `` deserveth God 's wrath and curse both in this life and that which is to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 18]: The master therefore was only a co-worker with God in every pandy he inflicted on his pupils .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 21]: I do not mean that he reasoned thus , but that such-like were the principles he had to act upon .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 33]: And I must add that , with all his brutality , he was never guilty of such cruelty as one reads of occasionally as perpetrated by English schoolmasters of the present day .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 26]: Nor were the boys ever guilty of such cruelty to their fellows as is not only permitted but excused in the public schools of England .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 25]: The taws , likewise , is a far less cruel instrument of torture than the cane , which was then unknown in that region .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 15]: And now the moderation which had at once followed upon the accident was confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 57]: Punishment became less frequent still , and where it was yet inflicted for certain kinds and degrees of offence , its administration was considerably less severe than formerly ; till at length the boys said that the master never put on black stockings now , except when he was `` oot o ' white anes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 11]: Nor did the discipline of the school suffer in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 41]: If one wants to make a hard-mouthed horse more responsive to the rein , he must relax the pressure and friction of the bit , and make the horse feel that he has got to hold up his own head .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 14]: If the rider supports himself by the reins , the horse will pull .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 15]: But the marvel was to see how Andrew Truffey haunted and dogged the master .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 11]: He was as it were a conscious shadow to him .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 19]: There was no hour of a holiday in which Truffey could not tell precisely where the master was .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 33]: If one caught sight of Andrew , _ hirpling _ down a passage , or leaning against a corner , he might be sure the master would pass within a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 40]: And the haunting of little Truffey worked so on his conscience , that , if the better nature of him had not asserted itself in love to the child , he would have been compelled to leave the place .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 27]: For think of having a visible sin of your own , in the shape of a lame-legged boy , peeping at you round every other corner !
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 18]: But he did learn to love the boy ; and therein appeared the divine vengeance -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 6]: how different from human vengeance !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 19]: -- that the outbreak of unrighteous wrath reacted on the wrong-doer in shame , repentance , and love .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 12]: At length the boat was calked , tarred , and painted .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 21]: One evening as Annie entered the workshop , she heard Curly cry , `` Here she is , Alec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 9]: and Alec answer , `` Let her come .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 6]: I 'm just done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 60]: Alec stood at the stern of the boat , with a pot in one hand , and a paint-brush in the other ; and , when Annie came near , she discovered to her surprise , and not a little to her delight , that he was just finishing off the last E of `` THE BONNIE ANNIE . ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 13]: `` There , '' said he , `` that 's her name .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 9]: Hoo de ye like it , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 8]: Annie was too much pleased to reply .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 29]: She looked at it for a while with a flush on her face : and then turning away , sought her usual seat on the heap of spales .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 54]: How much that one winter , with its dragons and its heroes , its boat-building and its rhymes , its discomforts at home and its consolations abroad , its threats of future loss , and comforts of present hope , had done to make the wild country child into a thoughtful little woman !
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 14]: Now who should come into the shop at the moment but Thomas Crann !
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 59]: -- the very man of all men not to be desired on the occasion ; for the boys had contemplated a certain ceremony of christening , which they dared not carry out in the presence of the stone-mason ; without which , however , George Macwha was very doubtful whether the little craft would prove a lucky one .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 19]: -- By common understanding they made no allusion to the matter , thus postponing it for the present .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 16]: Alec , '' said Thomas ; `` sae yer boat 's bigget at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 56]: He stood contemplating it for a moment , not without some hardly perceptible signs of admiration , and then said : `` Gin ye had her out upon a muckle water , do ye think ye wad jump oot ower the side o ' her , gin the Saviour tauld ye , Alec Forbes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 15]: `` Ay wad I , gin I war richt sure he wantit me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 16]: `` Ye wad stan ' an ' parley wi ' him , nae doot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 29]: `` I bude -LRB- behoved -RRB- to be richt sure it was his ain sel ' , ye ken , an ' that he did call me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 6]: `` Ow ay , laddie !
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 6]: That 's a ' richt .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 7]: Weel , I houp ye wad .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 14]: I aye had guid houps o ' ye , Alec , my man .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 79]: But there may be sic a thing as loupin ' into the sea o ' life oot o ' the ark o ' salvation ; an ' gin ye loup in whan he doesna call ye , or gin ye getna a grip o ' his han ' , whan he does , ye 're sure to droon , as sure 's ane o ' the swine that ran heedlong in and perished i ' the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 26]: Alec had only a dim sense of his meaning , but he had faith that it was good , and so listened in respectful silence .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 22]: Surely enough of sacred as well as lovely sound had been uttered over the boat to make her faithful and fortunate !
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 16]: The hour arrived at length when _ The Bonnie Annie _ was to be launched .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 39]: It was one of a bright Saturday afternoon , in the month of May , full of a kind of tearful light , which seemed to say : `` Here I am , but I go to-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 52]: Yet though there might be plenty of cold weather to come , though the hail might ; fall in cart-loads , and the snow might lie thick for a day or two , there would be no more frozen waters , and the boughs would be bare and desolate no more .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 30]: A few late primroses were peeping from the hollows damp with moss and shadow along the banks , and the trees by the stream were in small young leaf .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 43]: There was a light wind full of memories of past summers and promises for the new one at hand , one of those gentle winds that blow the eyes of the flowers open , that the earth may look at the heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 19]: In the midst of this baby-waking of the world , the boat must glide into her new life .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 23]: Alec got one of the men on the farm to _ yoke a horse _ to bring the boat to the river .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 22]: With the help of George she was soon placed in the cart , and Alec and Curly got in beside her .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 50]: The little creature looked very much like a dead fish , as she lay jolting in the hot sun , with a motion irksome to her delicate sides , her prow sticking awkwardly over the horse 's back , and her stern projecting as far beyond the cart behind .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 25]: Thus often is the human boat borne painfully to the stream on which thereafter it shall glide contentedly through and out of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 24]: When they had got about half-way , Alec said to Curly : `` I wonner what 's come o ' Annie , Curly ?
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 14]: It wad be a shame to lainch the boat wantin ' her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 5]: `` Deed it wad .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 20]: I s ' jist rin and luik after her , an ' ye can luik efter the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 13]: So saying , Curly was out of the cart with a bound .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 25]: Away he ran over a field of potatoes , straight as the crow flies , while the cart went slowly on towards the Glamour .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 7]: `` Whaur 's Annie Anderson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 12]: he cried , as he burst into Robert Bruce 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 9]: `` What 's _ your _ business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 13]: asked the Bruce -- a question which evidently looked for no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 6]: `` Alec wants her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 37]: `` Weel , he will want her , '' retorted Robert , shutting his jaws with a snap , and grinning a smileless grin from ear to ear , like the steel clasp of a purse .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 31]: By such petty behaviour he had long ago put himself on an equality with the young rascals generally , and he was no match for them on their own level .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 37]: Curly left the shop at once , and went round by the close into the garden , where he found Annie loitering up and down with the baby in her arms , and looking very weary .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 21]: This was in fact the first time she had had to carry the baby , and it fatigued her dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 35]: Till now Mrs Bruce had had the assistance of a ragged child , whose father owed them money for groceries : he could not pay it , and they had taken his daughter instead .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 20]: Long ago , however , she had slaved it out , and had at length gone back to school .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 27]: The sun was hot , the baby was heavy , and Annie felt all arms and back -- they were aching so with the unaccustomed drudgery .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 26]: She was all but crying when Curly darted to the gate , his face glowing with his run , and his eyes sparkling with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 20]: `` Come , Annie , '' cried he ; `` we 're gaein ' to lainch the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 15]: `` I canna , Curly ; I hae the bairn to min ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 11]: `` Tak the bairn in til ` ts mither . ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 5]: `` I daurna . ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 15]: `` Lay ' t doon o ' the table , an ' rin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 12]: `` Na , na , Curly ; I cudna do that .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 5]: Puir little crater ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 7]: `` Is the beastie heavy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 7]: asked Curly , with deceitful interest .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 5]: `` Dreadfu ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 6]: `` Lat 's try . ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 9]: `` Ye 'll lat her fa ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 4]: `` Deed no .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 9]: I 'm no sae fusionless -LRB- pithless -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 9]: Gie 's a haud o ' her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 33]: Annie yielded her charge ; but no sooner had Curly possession of the baby , than he bounded away with her out of the garden into the back yard adjoining the house .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 40]: Now in this yard , just opposite the kitchen-window , there was a huge sugar-cask , which , having been converted into a reservoir , stood under a spout , and was at this moment half full of rain-water .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 54]: Curly , having first satisfied himself that Mrs Bruce was at work in the kitchen , and therefore sure to see him , mounted a big stone that lay beside the barrel , and pretended to lower the baby into the water , as if trying how much she would endure with equanimity .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 34]: In a moment , he received such a box on the ear that , had he not been prepared for it , he would in reality have dropped the child into the barrel .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 36]: The same moment the baby was in its mother 's arms , and Curly sitting at the foot of the barrel , nursing his head , and pretending to suppress a violent attack of weeping .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 12]: The angry mother sped into the house with her rescued child .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 30]: No sooner had she disappeared than Curly was on his feet scudding back to Annie , who had been staring over the garden-gate in utter bewilderment at his behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 69]: She could no longer resist his entreaties : off she ran with him to the banks of the Glamour , where they soon came upon Alec and the man in the act of putting the boat on the slip , which , in the present instance , was a groove hollowed out of a low part of the bank , so that she might glide in more gradually .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 3]: `` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 5]: There 's Annie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 3]: cried Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 8]: -- `` Come awa ' , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 17]: Here 's a glass o ' whisky I got frae my mither to kirsten the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 11]: Fling ' t at the name o ' her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 58]: Annie did as she was desired , to the perfect satisfaction of all present , particularly of the long , spare , sinewy farm-servant , who had contrived , when Alec 's back was turned , to swallow the whisky and substitute Glamour water , which no doubt did equally well for the purposes of the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 68]: Then with a gentle push from all , the _ Bonnie Annie _ , slid into the Glamour , where she lay afloat in contented grace , as unlike herself in the cart as a swan waddling wearily to the water is unlike the true swan-self when her legs have no longer to support her weight , but to oar her along through the friendly upholding element .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 6]: `` Isna she bonnie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 5]: cried Annie in delight .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 26]: And indeed she was bonnie , in her green and white paint , lying like a great water-beetle ready to scamper over the smooth surface .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 11]: Alec sprang on board , nearly upsetting the tiny craft .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 23]: Then he held it by a bush on the bank while Curly handed in Annie , who sat down in the stern .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 15]: Curly then got in himself , and Alec and him seized each an oar .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 20]: But what with their inexperience and the nature of the channel , they found it hard to get along .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 26]: The river was full of great stones , making narrow passages , so that , in some parts , it was not possible to row .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 26]: They knew nothing about the management of a boat , and were no more at ease than if they had been afloat in a tub .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 33]: Alec being stronger in the arms than Curly , they went round and round for some time , as if in a whirlpool , with a timeless and grotesque spluttering and sprawling .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 32]: At last they gave it up in weariness , and allowed the _ Bonnie Annie _ to float along the stream , taking care only to keep her off the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 60]: Past them went the banks -- here steep and stony , but green with moss where little trickling streams found their way into the channel ; there spreading into low alluvial shores , covered with lovely grass , starred with daisies and buttercups , from which here and there rose a willow , whose low boughs swept the water .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 49]: A little while ago , they had skated down its frozen surface , and had seen a snowy land shooting past them ; now with an unfelt gliding , they floated down , and the green meadows dreamed away as if they would dream past them for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 36]: -- Suddenly , as they rounded the corner of a rock , a great roar of falling water burst on their ears , and they started in dismay , `` The sluice is up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 3]: cried Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 10]: `` Tak ' to yer oar , Curly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 33]: Along this part of the bank , some twenty feet above them , ran a mill-race , which a few yards lower down communicated by means of a sluice with the river .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 34]: This sluice was now open , for , from the late rains , there was too much water ; and the surplus rushed from the race into the Glamour in a foaming cataract .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 21]: Annie seeing that the boys were uneasy , got very frightened , and , closing her eyes , sat motionless .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 24]: Louder and louder grew the tumult of the waters , till their sound seemed to fall in a solid thunder on her brain .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 14]: The boys tried hard to row against the stream , but without avail .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 43]: Slowly and surely it carried them down into the very heart of the boiling fall ; for on this side alone was the channel deep enough for the boat , and the banks were too steep and bare to afford any hold .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 32]: At last , the boat drifting stern foremost , a torrent of water struck Annie , and tumbled into the boat as if it would beat out the bottom of it .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 14]: Annie was tossed about in fierce waters , and ceased to know anything .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 24]: When she came to herself , she was in an unknown bed , with the face of Mrs Forbes bending anxiously over her .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 22]: She would have risen , but Mrs Forbes told her to lie still , which indeed Annie found much more pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 15]: As soon as they got under the fall the boat had filled and foundered .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 17]: Alec and Curly could swim like otters , and were out of the pool at once .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 21]: As they went down , Alec had made a plunge to lay hold of Annie , but had missed her .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 80]: The moment he got his breath , he swam again into the boiling pool , dived , and got hold of her ; but he was so stupefied by the force of the water falling upon him and beating him down , that he could not get out of the raging depth -- for here the water was many feet deep -- and as he would not leave his hold of Annie , was in danger of being drowned .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 21]: Meantime Curly had scrambled on shore and climbed up to the mill-race , where he shut down the sluice hard .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 17]: In a moment the tumult had ceased , and Alec and Annie were in still water .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 25]: In a moment more he had her on the bank , apparently lifeless , whence he carried her home to his mother in terror .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 17]: She immediately resorted to one or two of the usual restoratives , and was presently successful .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 20]: As soon as she had opened her eyes , Alec and Curly hurried off to get out their boat .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 64]: They met the miller in an awful rage ; for the sudden onset of twice the quantity of water on his overshot wheel , had set his machinery off as if it had been bewitched , and one old stone , which had lost its iron girdle , had flown in pieces , to the frightful danger of the miller and his men .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 6]: `` Ye ill-designed villains ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 14]: cried he at a venture , `` what gart ye close the sluice ?
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 13]: I s ' learn ye to min ' what ye 're aboot .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 8]: Deil tak ' ye for rascals ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 9]: And he seized one in each brawny hand .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 15]: `` Annie Anderson was droonin ' aneath the waste-water , '' answered Curly promptly .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 7]: `` The Lord preserve 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 12]: said the miller , relaxing his hold `` Hoo was that ?
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 7]: Did she fa ' in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 8]: The boys told him the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 24]: In a few minutes more the back-fall was again turned off , and the miller was helping them to get their boat out .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 9]: The _ Bonnie Annie _ was found uninjured .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 18]: Only the oars and stretchers had floated down the stream , and were never heard of again .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 15]: Alec had a terrible scolding from his mother for getting Annie into such mischief .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 37]: Indeed Mrs Forbes did not like the girl 's being so much with her son ; but she comforted herself with the probability that by and by Alec would go to college , and forget her .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 49]: Meantime , she was very kind to Annie , and took her home herself , in order to excuse her absence , the blame of which she laid entirely on Alec , not knowing that thereby she greatly aggravated any offence of which Annie might have been guilty .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 22]: Mrs Bruce solemnly declared her conviction that a judgment had fallen upon her for Willie Macwha 's treatment of her baby .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 26]: `` Gin I hadna jist gotten a glimp o ' him in time , he wad hae drooned the bonny infant afore my verra een .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 8]: It 's weel waured on them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 29]: It did not occur to her that a wet skin was so very moderate a punishment for child-murder , that possibly there had been no connection between them .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 32]: This first voyage of the _ Bonnie Annie _ may seem a bad beginning ; but I am not sure that most good ends have not had such a bad beginning .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 13]: Perhaps the world itself may be received as a case in point .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 15]: Alec and Curly went about for a few days with a rather subdued expression .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 34]: But as soon as the boat was refitted , they got George Macwha to go with them for cockswain ; and under his instructions , they made rapid progress in rowing and sculling .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 33]: Then Annie was again their companion , and , the boat being by this time fitted with a rudder , had several lessons in steering , in which she soon became proficient .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 84]: Many a moonlight row they had on the Glamour ; and many a night after Curly and Annie had gone home , would Alec again unmoor the boat , and drop down the water alone , letting the banks go dreaming past him -- not always sure that he was not dreaming himself , and would not suddenly awake and find himself in his bed , and not afloat between heaven and earth , with the moon above and the moon below him .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 68]: I think it was in these seasons that he began first to become aware of a certain stillness pervading the universe like a law ; a stillness ever being broken by the cries of eager men , yet ever closing and returning with gentleness not to be repelled , seeking to infold and penetrate with its own healing the minds of the noisy children of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 25]: But he paid little heed to the discovery then , for he was made for activity , and in activity he found his repose .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 25]: My story must have shown already that , although several years younger than Alec , Annie had much more character and personality than he .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 12]: Alec had not yet begun to look realities in the face .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 29]: The very nobility and fearlessness of his nature had preserved him from many such actions as give occasion for looking within and asking oneself whereto things are tending .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 40]: Full of life and restless impulses to activity , all that could properly be required of him as yet was that the action into which he rushed should be innocent , and if conventionally mischievous , yet actually harmless .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 76]: Annie , comfortless at home , gazing all about her to see if there was a rest anywhere for her , had been driven by the outward desolation away from the window of the world to that other window that opens on the regions of silent being where God is , and into which when his creatures enter , or even look , the fountain of their life springs aloft with tenfold vigour and beauty .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 24]: Alec , whose home was happy , knew nothing of that sense of discomfort which is sometimes the herald of a greater need .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 32]: But he was soon to take a new start in his intellectual relations ; nor in those alone , seeing the change was the result of a dim sense of duty .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 48]: The fact of his not being a scholar to the mind of Murdoch Malison , arose from no deficiency of intellectual _ power _ , but only of intellectual _ capacity _ -- for the indefinite enlargement of which a fitting excitement from without is alone requisite .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 23]: The season went on , and the world , like a great flower afloat in space , kept opening its thousandfold blossom .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 29]: Hail and sleet were things lost in the distance of the year -- storming away in some far-off region of the north , unknown to the summer generation .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 41]: The butterflies , with wings looking as if all the flower-painters of fairyland had wiped their brushes upon them in freakful yet artistic sport , came forth in the freedom of their wills and the faithful ignorance of their minds .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 19]: The birds , the poets of the animal creation -- what though they never get beyond the lyrical !
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 19]: -- awoke to utter their own joy , and awake like joy in others of God 's children .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 32]: The birds grew silent , because their history laid hold upon them , compelling them to turn their words into deeds , and keep eggs warm , and hunt for worms .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 9]: The butterflies died of old age and delight .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 19]: The green life of the earth rushed up in corn to be ready for the time of need .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 26]: The corn grew ripe , and therefore weary , hung its head , died , and was laid aside for a life beyond its own .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 33]: The keen sharp old mornings and nights of autumn came back as they had come so many thousand times before , and made human limbs strong and human hearts sad and longing .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 35]: Winter would soon be near enough to stretch out a long forefinger once more , and touch with the first frosty shiver some little child that loved summer , and shrunk from the cold .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 52]: One evening in early autumn , when the sun , almost on the edge of the horizon , was shining right in at the end of one of the principal streets , filling its whole width with its glory of molten roses , all the shopkeepers were standing in their doors .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 24]: Little groups of country people , bearing a curious relation to their own legs , were going in various directions across the square .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 28]: Loud laughter , very much like animal noises , now and then invaded the ear ; but the sound only rippled the wide lake of the silence .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 18]: The air was perfumed with the scent of peat fires and the burning of weeds and potato-tops .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 31]: There was no fountain to complete the harmony , but the intermittent gushes from the spout of the great pump in the centre of the square were no bad substitute .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 20]: At all events , they supplied the sound of water , without which Nature 's orchestra is not full .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 52]: Wattie Sim , the watchmaker , long and lank , with grey bushy eyebrows meeting over his nose , wandered , with the gait of a heedless pair of compasses , across from his own shop to Redford the bookseller 's , at whose door a small group was already gathered .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 19]: `` Well , Wattie , '' said Captain Clashmach , `` how goes the world with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 24]: `` Muckle the same 's wi ' yersel ' , Captain , and the doctor there , '' answered Wattie with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 20]: `` Whan the time 's guid for ither fowk , it 's but sae sae for you and me .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 16]: I haena had a watch come in for a haill ook -LRB- week -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 12]: `` Hoo de ye accoont for that , Mr Sim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 12]: asked a shoemaker who stood near without belonging to the group .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 11]: `` It 's the ile , man , the ile .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 11]: Half the mischeef o ' watches is the ile . ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 21]: `` But I do n't see , '' said the doctor , `` how that can be , Sim . ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 52]: `` Weel , ye see , sir , '' answered Wattie -- and the words seemed somehow to have come tumbling silently down over the ridge of his nose , before he caught them in his mouth and articulated them -- `` ye see , sir , watches is delicat things .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 18]: They 're not to be traitet like fowk 's insides wi ' onything ` at comes first .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 37]: Gin I cud jist get the middle half-pint oot o ' the hert o ' a hogsheid o ' sperm ile , I wad I sud keep a ' yer watches gaein like the verra universe .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 13]: But it wad be an ill thing for me , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 13]: Sae maybe a ' thing 's for the best efter a ' .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 26]: -- Noo , ye see , i ' this het weather , the ile keeps fine an ' saft , and disna clog the warks .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 7]: -- But losh preserves a ' !
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 5]: What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 44]: Staring up the street towards the sunset , which coloured all their faces a red bronze , stood a group of townsfolk , momently increasing , from which , before Wattie 's party could reach it , burst a general explosion of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 26]: It was some moments , however , before they understood what was the matter , for the great mild sun shone full in their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 46]: At length they saw , as if issuing from the huge heavy orb , a long dark line , like a sea-serpent of a hundred joints , coming down the street towards them , and soon discovered that it was a slow procession of animals .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 21]: First came Mistress Stephen , Stumpin Steenie the policeman 's cow , with her tail at full stretch behind her .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 42]: To the end of her tail was tied the nose of Jeames Joss the cadger 's horse -- a gaunt sepulchral animal , which age and ill-treatment had taught to move as if knees and hocks were useless refinements in locomotion .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 38]: He had just enough of a tail left to tie the nose of another cow to ; and so , by the accretion of living joints , the strange monster lengthened out into the dim fiery distance .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 25]: When Mrs Stephen reached the square , she turned to lead her train diagonally across it , for in that direction lay her home .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 19]: Moved by the same desire , the cadger 's horse wanted to go in exactly the opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 37]: The cow pulled the one way , and the horse pulled the other ; but the cow , having her head free , had this advantage over the horse , which was fast at both ends .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 12]: So he gave in , and followed his less noble leader .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 35]: Cow after horse , and horse after cow , with a majority of cows , followed , to the number of twenty or so ; after which the joints began to diminish in size .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 22]: Two calves were at the tail of the last cow , a little Highland one , with a sheep between them .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 43]: Then came a goat belonging to Charles Chapman the wool-carder , the only goat in the place , which as often as the strain on his own tail slackened , made a butt at that of the calf in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 34]: Next came a diminishing string of disreputable dogs , to the tail of the last of which was fastened the only cat the inventors of this novel pastime had been able to catch .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 7]: At her tail followed -- alas !
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 110]: -- Andrew Truffey 's white rabbit , whose pink eyes , now fixed and glazed , would no more delight the imagination of the poor cripple ; and whose long furry hind legs would never more bang the ground in sovereign contempt , as he dared pursuit ; for the dull little beast , having , with the stiffneckedness of fear , persisted in pulling against the string that tied him to the tail of Widow Wattles 's great tom-cat , was now trailed ignominiously upon his side , with soiled fur and outstretched neck -- the last joint , and only dead one , of this bodiless tail .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 68]: Before Mistress Stephen had reached her home , and just as the last link of the chain had appeared on the square , the mirth was raised to a yet higher pitch by the sudden rush of several women to the rescue , who had already heard the news of the ignominious abduction of their honoured _ kye _ , and their shameful exposure to public ridicule .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 8]: Each made for her own four-footed property .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 7]: `` Guid preserve 's , Hawkie !
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 7]: are ye come to this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 23]: cried Lucky Lapp , as she limped , still and ever lame with rheumatism , towards the third member of the procession .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 67]: `` Gin I had the loon that did it , '' she went on , fumbling , with a haste that defeated itself , at the knot that bound Hawkie 's nose to the tail of the cadger 's horse -- `` gin I had the loon ` at did it , I wad ding the sowl oot o ' his wame , the villain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 3]: `` Losh !
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 14]: it 's my ain cat , as weel 's my ain coo . ''
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 7]: screamed Lucky Wattles in twofold indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 21]: `` Gin I cud but redd -LRB- comb -RRB- the scoonrel 's heid wi ' your cleuks , Baudrons ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 35]: she added , as she fondled the cat passionately , `` he wadna be in sic a doom 's hurry to han ` le ye again , Is ' wad -LRB- wager -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 23]: By this time Stumpin ' Steenie , having undone his cow 's tail , was leading her home amid shouts of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 10]: `` Pit her i ' the lock-up , Steenie .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 16]: She 's been takin ' up wi ' ill loons , '' screeched an urchin .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 22]: `` Haud yer ill tongue , or I s ' tak ' you up , ye rascal , '' bawled Steenie .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 19]: `` Ye 'll hae to saiddle Mistress Stephen afore ye can catch me , Stumpin ' Steenie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 37]: Steenie , inflamed with sudden wrath , forsook the cow , and made an elephantine rush at the offender , who vanished in the crowd , and thus betrayed the constable to another shout of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 34]: While the laugh was yet ringing , the burly figure of the stonemason appeared , making his way by the momentum of great bulk and slow motion to the front of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 35]: Without a word to any one , he drew a knife from his pocket , and proceeded to cut every cord that bound the helpless animals , the people staring silent all the while .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 19]: It was a sight to see how the dogs scampered off in the delight of their recovered freedom .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 11]: But the rabbit lay where the cat had left him .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 27]: Thomas took it with some sign of tenderness , and holding it up in his huge hand , put the question to the crowd in general .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 7]: `` Wha 's aucht this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 8]: `` It 's cripple Truffey 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 6]: piped a shrill little voice .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 26]: `` Tell him ` at I 'll account for ` t , '' rejoined Thomas , and putting the animal in his pocket , departed .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 36]: He took the nearest way to George Macwha 's workshop , where he found Alec and Curly , as he had expected , busy or appearing to be busy about something belonging to their boat .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 16]: They looked considerably hotter , however , than could be accounted for by their work .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 6]: This confirmed Thomas 's suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 13]: `` A fine ploy yon for a young gentleman , Alec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 7]: `` What ploy , Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 7]: asked Alec , with attempted innocence .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 13]: `` Ye ken weel eneuch what ploy I mean , man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 28]: `` Weel , supposin ' I do -- there 's nae that muckle hairm dune , to mak ' a wark aboot , surely , Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 9]: `` Ca ' ye that no hairm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 20]: rejoined Thomas , pulling the dead rabbit out of his pocket , and holding it up by the ears .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 9]: `` Ca ' ye that no hairm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 5]: Alec stared in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 14]: Thomas well knew his regard for animals , and had calculated upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 16]: `` Luik at the puir thing wi ' its bonny reid een closed for ever !
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 34]: It 's a mercy to think ` at there 's no lemin ' and lowin ' -LRB- blazing and flaming -RRB- future in store for hit , puir mappy -LRB- bunny -RRB- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 9]: `` Hoot , hoot , Thamas , man !
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 14]: Isna that bein ' richteous overmuch , as oor minister wad say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 27]: The question came in the husky voice of Peter Whaup , the blacksmith , who was now discovered leaning in over the half-door of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 15]: `` And wha 's _ your _ minister , Peter , my man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 7]: retorted Thomas , with some acrimony .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 12]: `` Mr Cooie , as ye weel ken , Thamas . ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 6]: `` I thoucht as muckle .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 10]: The doctrine savours o ' the man , Peter .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 19]: There 's no fear o ' him or ony o ' his followers bein ' richteous over-much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 18]: `` Weel , ye ken , that 's naething but a rabbit i ' yer han ' .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 8]: It wad hae been worried some day .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 11]: Hoo cam ' ' t by ` ts deith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 25]: `` I didna mean to kill ` t. 'T was a ' for fun , ye ken , '' said Alec , addressing Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 56]: `` There 's a heap o ' fun , '' answered Thomas with solemnity , `` that carries deith i ' the tail o ' ` t. Here 's the puir cripple laddie 's rabbit as deid 's a herrin ' , and him at hame greetin ' his een oot , I daursay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 11]: Alec caught up his cap and made for the door .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 8]: `` I 'll gang and see him .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 10]: Curly , wha has ony rabbits to sell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 10]: `` Doddles 's cleckit aboot a month ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 7]: `` Whaur does Doddles bide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 8]: `` I 'll lat ye see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 17]: The boys were hurrying together from the shop , when Thomas caught Alec by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 10]: `` Ye canna restore the rabbit , Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 3]: `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 28]: Thamas , ae rabbit 's as guid 's anither , '' interposed the smith , in a tone indicating disapprobation , mingled with a desire to mollify .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 11]: `` Ay -- to them ` at cares for neither .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 36]: But there 's sic a thing as a human election , as weel 's a divine ane ; an ' ane 's no the same 's anither , ance it 's a chosen ane . ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 32]: `` Weel , I pity them ` at the Lord has no pity upo ' , '' sighed the smith , with a passing thought of his own fits of drinking .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 7]: `` Gang ye and try him .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 12]: He may hae pity upo ' you -- wha kens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 19]: said Thomas , as he followed Alec , whom he had already released , out of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 49]: `` Ye see , Alec , '' he resumed in a low voice , when they were in the open air -- Curly going on before them , `` it 's time ` at ye was growin ' a man , and pittin ' awa ' childish things .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 41]: Yer mither 'll be depen ` in ' upo ' you , or lang , to haud things gaein ' ; and ye ken gin ye negleck yer chance at the school , yer time 'll no come ower again .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 11]: Man , ye sud try to do something for conscience-sake .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 12]: Hae ye learnt yer lessons for the morn , noo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 5]: `` No , Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 4]: But I will .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 23]: I 'm jist gaein ' to buy a pair o ' rabbits to Truffey ; and syne I 'll gang hame . ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 7]: `` There 's a guid lad .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 13]: Ye 'll be a comfort till yer mither some day yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 10]: With these words , Thomas turned and left them .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 43]: There had been a growing , though it was still a vague sense , in Alec 's mind , that he was not doing well ; and this rebuke of Thomas Crann brought it full into the light of his own consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 7]: From that day he worked better .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 10]: Mr Malison saw the change , and acknowledged it .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 29]: This reacted on Alec 's feeling for the master ; and during the following winter he made three times the progress he had made in any winter preceding .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 42]: For the sea of summer ebbed away , and the rocky channels of the winter appeared , with its cold winds , its ghost-like mists , and the damps and shiverings that cling about the sepulchre in which Nature lies sleeping .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 22]: The boat was carefully laid up , across the rafters of the barn , well wrapped in a shroud of tarpaulin .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 27]: It was buried up in the air ; and the Glamour on which it had floated so gaily , would soon be buried under the ice .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 29]: Summer alone could bring them together again -- the one from the dry gloom of the barn , the other from the cold seclusion of its wintry hebetude .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 28]: Meantime Mrs Forbes was somewhat troubled in her mind as to what should be done with Alec ; and she often talked with the schoolmaster about him .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 26]: Herself of higher birth , socially considered , than her husband , she had the ambition that her son should be educated for some profession .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 94]: Now in Scotland education is more easily got than almost anything else ; and whether there might be room for the exercise of the profession afterwards , was a matter of less moment to Mrs Forbes , seeing she was not at all willing that the farm which had been in her husband 's family for hundreds of years , should pass into the hands of strangers , and Alec himself had the strongest attachment to the ancestral soil ; for to be loved it is not necessary that land should be freehold .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 33]: At length his increased diligence , which had not escaped her observation , and was testified to by Mr Malison , confirmed her determination that he should at least go to college .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 14]: He would be no worse a farmer for having an _ A.M _ .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 14]: after his name ; while the curriculum was common to all the professions .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 20]: So it was resolved that , in the following winter , he should _ compete for a bursary _ .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 14]: The communication that his fate lay in that direction roused Alec still more .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 68]: Now that an ulterior object rendered them attractive , he turned his attention to the classics with genuine earnestness ; and , on a cloudy day in the end of October , found himself on the box-seat of the Royal Mail , with his trunk on the roof behind him , bound for a certain city whose advantages are not confined to the possession of a university .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 22]: After driving through long streets , brilliant with shops of endless marvel , the coachman pulled up for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 21]: It was a dull drizzly evening , with sudden windy gusts , and , in itself , dark as pitch .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 32]: But Alec descended , cold and wet , in a brilliant light which flowed from the door of the hotel as if it had been the very essence of its structure .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 25]: A porter took charge of his box , hoisted it on his back , and led the way to the address he gave him .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 37]: Notwithstanding the drizzle , and the angry rushes of the wind round the street-corners , the foot-pavements were filled with men and women , moving in different directions , like a double row of busy ants .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 40]: Through queer short cuts that terribly bewildered the way , the porter led him to the house , and pushing the door open , went up two flights of stone stairs and knocked at a door on the landing .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 41]: Alec was shown into a room where a good fire was blazing away with a continuous welcome ; and when seated by it drinking his tea , he saw the whole world golden through the stained windows of his imagination .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 13]: But his satisfaction gradually passed into a vague longing after something else .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 17]: Would human nature be more perfect were it capable of being satisfied with cakes and ale ?
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 22]: Alec felt as if he had got to the borders of fairy-land , and _ something _ was going to happen .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 14]: A door would open and admit him into the secret of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 60]: But the door was so long in opening , that he took to unpacking his box ; when , as he jumped up to thank his mother for some peculiar remembrance of his likings , the whole affair suddenly changed to a rehearsal of death ; and his longings for the remainder of the night were towards the past .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 19]: He rose in the morning with the feeling revived , that something intense was going on all arouud .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 22]: But the door into life generally opens behind us , and a hand is put forth which draws us in backwards .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 39]: The sole wisdom for man or boy who is haunted with the hovering of unseen wings , with the scent of unseen roses , and the subtle enticements of `` melodies unheard , '' is _ work _ .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 11]: If he follow any of those , they will vanish .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 41]: But if he work , they will come unsought , and , while they come , he will believe that there is a fairy-land , where poets find their dreams , and prophets are laid hold of by their visions .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 25]: The idle beat their heads against its walls , or mistake the entrance , and go down into the dark places of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 34]: Alec stood at the window , and peered down into the narrow street , through which , as in a channel between rocks burrowed into dwellings , ran the ceaseless torrent of traffic .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 26]: He felt at first as if life at least had opened its gates , and he had been transported into the midst of its drama .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 47]: But in a moment the show changed , turning first into a meaningless procession ; then into a chaos of conflicting atoms ; re-forming itself at last into an endlessly unfolding coil , no break in the continuity of which would ever reveal the hidden mechanism .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 15]: For to no mere onlooker will Life any more than Fairy-land open its secret .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 14]: A man must become an actor before he can be a true spectator .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 15]: Weary of standing at the window , he went and wandered about the streets .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 31]: To his country-bred eyes they were full of marvels -- which would soon be as common to those eyes as one of the furrowed fields on his father 's farm .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 19]: The youth who thinks the world his oyster , and opens it forthwith , finds no pearl therein .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 10]: What is this _ nimbus _ about the new ?
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 6]: Is the marvel a mockery ?
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 7]: Is the shine that of demon-gold ?
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 36]: It is a winged glory that alights beside the youth ; and , having gathered his eyes to itself , flits away to a further perch ; there alights , there shines , thither entices .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 21]: With outstretched hands the child of earth follows , to fall weeping at the foot of the gray disenchanted thing .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 39]: But beyond , and again beyond , shines the lapwing of heaven -- not , as a faithless generation thinks , to delude like them , but to lead the seeker home to the nest of the glory .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 14]: Last of all , Alec was forced to take refuge in his books .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 17]: _ The competition _ fell on the next day , and he gained a small bursary .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 16]: As it happened , no one but Alec had come up from Glamerton that year .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 9]: He did not know one of his fellow-students .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 19]: There were very few in the first class indeed who had had any previous acquaintance with each other .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 21]: But before three days were over like had begun to draw to like , and opposites to their natural opposites .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 35]: These mutual attractions , however , were considerably influenced by the social sphere , as indicated by style of dress , speech , and manners , in which each had been accustomed to move .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 76]: Some of the youths were of the lowliest origin - the sons of ploughmen and small country shopkeepers ; shock-headed lads , with much of the looks and manners of year-old bullocks , mostly with freckled faces and a certain general irresponsiveness of feature , soon to vanish as the mental and nervous motions became more frequent and rapid , working the stiff clay of their faces into a readier obedience to the indwelling plasticity .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 26]: Some , on the other hand , showed themselves at once the aristocracy of the class , by their carriage and social qualifications or assumptions .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 29]: These were not generally the best scholars ; but they set the fashion in the cut of their coats , and especially in the style of their neckerchiefs .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 32]: Most of them were of Highland families ; some of them jolly , hearty fellows ; others affected and presumptuous , evidently considering it beneath them to associate with the multitude .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 7]: Alec belonged to a middle class .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 32]: Well-dressed , he yet knew that his clothes had a country air , and that beside some of the men he cut a poor figure in more than in this particular .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 26]: For a certain superiority of manner distinguished them , indicating that they had been accustomed to more of the outward refinements of life than he .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 53]: Now let Alec once feel that a man was wiser and better than himself , and he was straightway incapable of envying him any additional superiority possible -- would , in a word , be perfectly willing that he should both wear a better coat and be a better scholar than himself .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 25]: But to any one who did not possess the higher kind of superiority , he foolishly and enviously grudged the lower kinds of pre-eminence .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 43]: To understand this it must be remembered , that as yet he had deduced for himself no principles of action or feeling : he was only a boy well-made , with little goodness that he had in any way verified for himself .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 31]: On the second day after the commencement of lectures , it was made known to the first class that the Magistrand -LRB- fourth-class -RRB- Debating Society would meet that evening .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 33]: The meetings of this society , although under the control of the magistrands , were open , upon equal terms in most other respects , to the members of the inferior classes .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 33]: They were held in the Natural Philosophy class-room , at seven o'clock in the evening ; and to the first meeting of the session Alec went with no little curiosity and expectation .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 39]: It was already dark when he set out from his lodgings in the new town , for the gateway beneath the tower with that crown of stone which is the glory of the ancient borough gathered beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 25]: Through narrow crooked streets , with many dark courts on each side , he came to the open road which connected the two towns .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 31]: It was a starry night , dusky rather than dark , and full of the long sound of the distant sea-waves falling on the shore beyond the _ links _ .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 40]: He was striding along whistling , and thinking about as nearly nothing as might be , when the figure of a man , whose footsteps he had heard coming through the gloom , suddenly darkened before him and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 21]: It was a little spare , slouching figure , but what the face was like , he could not see .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 5]: `` Whustlin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 6]: said the man , interrogatively .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 8]: `` Ay ; what for no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 4]: answered Alec cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 49]: `` Haud yer een aff o ' rainbows , or ye 'll brak ' yer shins upo ' gravestanes , '' said the man , and went on , with a shuffling gait , his eyes flashing on Alec , from under projecting brows , as he passed .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 23]: Alec concluded him drunk , although drink would not altogether account for the strangeness of the address , and soon forgot him .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 34]: The arch echoed to his feet as he entered the dark quadrangle , across which a glimmer in the opposite tower guided him to the stairs leading up to the place of meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 48]: He found the large room lighted by a chandelier , and one of the students seated as president in the professor 's chair , while the benches were occupied by about two hundred students , most of the freshmen or _ bejans _ in their red gowns .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 34]: Various preliminary matters were discussed with an energy of utterance , and a fitness of speech , which would have put to shame the general elocution of both the pulpit and the bar .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 75]: At length , however , a certain _ semi _ -LRB- second-classman , or more popularly _ sheep _ -RRB- stood up to give his opinion on some subject in dispute , and attempting to speak too soon after his dinner , for he was one of the more fashionable order , hemmed and stammered till the weariness of the assembly burst upon him in a perfect torrent of hisses and other animal exclamations .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 93]: Among the loudest in this inarticulate protestation , were some of the red-gowned bejans , and the speaker kindled with wrath at the presumption of the yellow-beaks -LRB- becs jaunes : bejans -RRB- , till , indignation bursting open the barriers of utterance , he poured forth a torrent of sarcastic contempt on the young clod-hoppers , who , having just come from herding their fathers ' cows , could express their feelings in no more suitable language than that of the bovine animals which had been their principal and fit associates .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 70]: As he sat down , his eyes rested with withering scorn upon Alec Forbes , who instantly started to his feet amidst a confusion of plaudits and hisses , but , finding it absolutely impossible to speak so as to be heard , contented himself with uttering a sonorous _ ba-a-a-a _ , and instant dropped into his seat , all the other outcries dissolving in shouts of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 28]: In a moment he received a candle full in the face ; its companions went flying in all directions , and the room was in utter darkness .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 46]: A scramble for the door followed ; and amidst struggling , shouting , and swearing , the whole company rolled down the stair into the quadrangle , most of them without their caps , and some with their new gowns torn from bottom to top .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 8]: The night was hideous with the uproar .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 33]: In the descent , Alec received a blow on the head which half stunned him ; but he did not imagine that its severity was other than an accident of the crush .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 14]: He made the best of his way home , and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 57]: After this he was popular ; and after this , as often as Patrick Beauchamp and he passed each other in walking up and down the arcade , Beauchamp 's high curved upper lip would curve yet higher , and Alec would feel with annoyance that he could not sustain the glance of his gray eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 38]: Beauchamp was no great favourite even in his own set ; for there is one kind of religion in which the more devoted a man is , the fewer proselytes he makes : the worship of himself .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXV .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 50]: One morning , about two months from the beginning of the session , after the students had been reading for some time in the Greek class , the professor was seen , not unexpectedly to part of the assembly , to look up at the ceiling with sudden discomposure .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 70]: There had been a heavy fall of snow in the night , and one of the students , whose organ of humour had gained at the expense of that of veneration , had , before the arrival of the professor , gathered a ball of the snow , and thrown it against the ceiling with such forceful precision , that it stuck right over the centre of the chair .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 31]: This was perhaps the first time that such a trick had been dared in the first class , belonging more properly to the advanced depravity of the second or third .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 34]: When the air began to get warm , the snow began to drop upon the head of the old professor ; and this was the cause of his troubled glance at the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 53]: But the moment he looked up , Alec , seeing what was the matter , and feeling all his natural loyalty roused , sprang from his seat , and rushing out of the class-room , returned with a long broom which the sacrist had been using to clear foot-paths across the quadrangle .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 20]: The professor left his chair , and Alec springing on the desk , swept the snow from the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 14]: He then wiped the seat with his handkerchief and returned to his place .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 11]: The gratitude of the old man shone in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 33]: True , he would only have had to send for the sacrist to rescue him ; but here was an atonement for the insult , offered by one of the students themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 24]: `` Thank you , Mr Forbes , '' he stammered ; `` I am ek ek ek -- exceedingly obliged to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 67]: The professor was a curious , kindly little man -- lame , with a brown wig , a wrinkled face , and a long mouth , of which he only made use of the half on the right side to stammer out humorous and often witty sayings -- at least so they appeared to those who had grace enough to respect his position and his age .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 48]: As often as reference is made in my hearing to Charles Lamb and his stutter , up comes the face of dear old Professor Fraser , and I hear him once more stammering out some joke , the very fun of which had its source in kindliness .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 19]: Somehow the stutter never interfered with the point of the joke : that always came with a rush .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 22]: He seemed , while hesitating on some unimportant syllable , to be arranging what was to follow and strike the blow .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 27]: `` Gentlemen , '' he continued upon this occasion , `` the Scripture says you 're to heap c-c-c-coals of fire on your enemy 's head .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 21]: When you are to heap drops of water on your friend 's w-w-wig , the Scripture does n't say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 28]: The same evening Alec received a note from him asking him to breakfast with him the following morning , which was Saturday , and consequently a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 30]: It was usual with the professors to invite a dozen or so of the students to breakfast on Saturdays , but on this occasion Alec was the sole guest .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 29]: As soon as he entered the room , Mr Fraser hobbled to meet him , with outstretched hand of welcome , and a kindly grin on his face .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 23]: `` Mr Forbes , '' he said , `` I h-h-hope well of you ; for you can respect an old man .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 8]: I 'm very glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 10]: I hope you 've brought an appetite with you .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 3]: Sit down .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 8]: Always respect old age , Mr Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 20]: You 'll be old yourself some day -- and you wo n't like it any more than I do .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 16]: I 've had my young days , though , and I must n't grumble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 26]: And here he smiled ; but it was a sad smile , and a tear gathered in the corner of one of his old eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 15]: He caught up a globular silver tea-pot , and began to fill the tea-cups .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 55]: Apparently the reflection of his own face in the tea-pot was too comical to resist , for the old man presently broke into what was half a laugh and half a grin , and , without in any way accounting for it , went on talking quite merrily for the rest of the meal .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 36]: `` My mother told me , '' said Alec at length , `` in a letter I had from her yesterday , that your brother , sir , had married a cousin of hers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 2]: what !
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 11]: Are you a son of Mr Forbes of Howglen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 5]: `` You young rascal !
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 11]: Why did n't your mother send you to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 15]: `` She did n't like to trouble you , I suppose , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 21]: `` People like me , that have n't any relations , must make the most of the relations they have .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 11]: I am in no danger of being troubled that way .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 11]: You 've heard of my poor brother 's death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 6]: `` He died last year .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 8]: He was a clergyman , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 21]: When you come up next session , I hope to show you his daughter -- your cousin , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 8]: She is coming to live with me .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 12]: People that do n't marry do n't deserve to have children .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 10]: But I 'm going to have one after all .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 6]: She 's at school now .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 12]: What do you think of turning to , Mr Forbes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 13]: `` I have n't thought much about it yet , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 4]: I daresay not .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 11]: If I were you , I would be a doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 13]: If you 're honest , you 're sure to do some good .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 17]: I think you 're just the man for a doctor now -- you respect your fellow-men .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 12]: You do n't laugh at old age , Mr Forbes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 16]: And so the kind garrulous old man went on , talking about everything except Greek .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 7]: For that he had no enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 18]: Indeed , he did not know enough to have , by possibility , any feeling about it .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 15]: What he did know , however , he taught well , and very conscientiously .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 16]: This was the first time that Alec 's thoughts had been turned towards a profession .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 54]: The more he thought about it the better he liked the idea of being a doctor ; till at length , after one or two talks about it with Mr Fraser , he resolved , notwithstanding that the session was considerably advanced , to attend the anatomical course for the rest of it .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 28]: The Greek and Latin were tolerably easy to him , and it would be so much time gained if he entered the first medical class at once .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 20]: He need not stand the examination except he liked , and the fee was not by any means large .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 35]: His mother was more than satisfied with the proposal , and , although what seemed a trifle to Alec was of some consequence to her , she sent him at once the necessary supplies .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 28]: Mr Fraser smoothed the way for him with the professor , and he was soon busy making up his distance by a close study of the class-books .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 19]: The first day of his attendance in the dissecting-room was a memorable one , and had memorable consequences .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 42]: He had considerable misgivings about the new experience he had to meet , and sought , by the concentration of his will , to prepare himself to encounter the inevitable with calmness , and , if possible , with seeming indifference .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 33]: But he was not prepared after all for the disadvantage of entering a company already hardened to those peculiarities of the position for which a certain induration is as desirable as unavoidable .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 13]: When he entered the room , he found a group already gathered .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 68]: He drew timidly towards the table on the other side , not daring to glance at something which lay upon it -- `` white with the whiteness of what is dead ; '' and , feeling as if all the men were looking at him , as indeed most of them were , kept staring , or trying to stare , at other things in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 20]: But all at once , from an irresistible impulse , he faced round , and looked at the table .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 37]: There lay the body of a woman , with a young sad face , beautiful in spite of a terrible scar on the forehead , which indicated too plainly with what brutal companions she had consorted .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 16]: Alec 's lip quivered , and his throat swelled with a painful sensation of choking .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 15]: He turned away , and bit his lip hard to keep down his emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 14]: The best quality he possessed was an entire and profound reverence for women .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 43]: Indignation even was almost quelled in the shock he received , when one of the students , for the pleasure of sneering at his discomposure , and making a boast of his own superiority to such weakness , uttered a brutal jest .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 22]: In vain the upturned face made its white appeal to the universe : a laugh billowed the silence about its head .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 19]: But no rudeness could hurt that motionless heart -- no insult bring a blush on that pale face .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 28]: The closed eyes , the abandoned hands seemed only to pray : `` Let me into the dark -- out of the eyes of those men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 18]: Alec gave one sob in the vain effort to master the conflicting emotions of indignation and pity .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 15]: It reverberated in the laugh which burst from the students of the healing art .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 33]: Almost quenched in the laugh he heard one word however , in the same voice which had made the jest -- a voice he knew well enough -- that of Patrick Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 57]: His face blazed up ; his eyes flashed ; and he had made one step forward , when he was arrested by the still face of the dead woman , which , ghostly as the morning moon , returned no glow in the red sunlight of his wrath ; and in reverence he restrained his anger .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 8]: In another moment , the professor arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 7]: During the lecture and accompanying demonstrations .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 31]: Alec was deaf and blind from burning rage ; in the midst of which , however , he almost forgot his own wrong in regarding that done to the dead .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 22]: He became , in his own eyes , the champion of one whom nature and death had united to render defenceless .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 26]: From the verge of a gulf more terrible than the grave , her cry had reached him , and he would rise to avenge her .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 13]: As soon as they came out , he walked up to Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 15]: `` You called me a spoony , '' he said through his set teeth .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 15]: `` I did , '' answered Beauchamp , with an admirable drawl of indifference .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 12]: Alec replied with a blow ; whereupon Beauchamp knocked him down .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 30]: But he was up in a moment ; and , although his antagonist was both older and bigger , the elasticity of his perfect health soon began to tell .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 34]: There was little science between them , and what there was lay on Beauchamp 's side ; yet he defended himself more and more feebly , for his wind had soon given way .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 51]: At length , after receiving a terrible blow on the mouth , Beauchamp dropped his arms and turned his back ; and Alec , after some hesitation , let him go without the parting kick which he was tempted to give him , and which he had so well deserved .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 85]: The men dispersed without remark , ashamed of themselves , and admiring the bumpkin -- most of them were gentlemen enough for that ; while each of the combatants retired unaccompanied to his own lodging -- Alec with a black eye , which soon passed through yellow back to its own natural hue , and Beauchamp with a cut , the scar of which deepened the sneer on his upper lip , and was long his evil counsellor from the confessional of the mirror .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVII .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 36]: The encounter fortunately took place upon a Friday , so that the combatants had both Saturday and Sunday , with the deodand of a slight fine for being absent from chapel , to recover appearances .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 18]: Alec kept to the house both days , and read hard at his medical and anatomical books .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 49]: His landlady took charge of his eye , and ministered to it with assiduity and discretion , asking no questions , and courting no confidences , only looking at him comically now and then out of gray motherly eyes , that might have been trusted with the universe .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 7]: She knew the ways of students .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 44]: In the course of one of the dressings , she said : `` Ye 'll be thinkin ' lang -LRB- ennuy -RRB- , Mr Forbes , at haein ' to bide i ' the hoose wi ' that blackamoor ee o ' yours .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 20]: Hoo dinna ye gang up the stair to Mr Cupples , and hae a lauch wi ' him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 11]: `` I didna ken ye had onybody up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 6]: Wha 's Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 9]: `` Weel , he kens that best himsel !
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 8]: But he 's a gey queer ane .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 23]: He 's a terrible scholar though , fowk says -- gran ' at the Greek , and rael bonny on the mathewmawtics .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 12]: Only ye maunna be fleyt -LRB- frightened -RRB- at him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 14]: `` I 'm easy fleyt , '' said Alec , with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 10]: `` But I wad like to see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 20]: `` Gang up , than , and chap at the garret door upo ' yer left han ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 15]: `` But what reason am I to gie him for disturbin ' him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 3]: asked Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 5]: `` Ow nane ava .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 29]: Jist tak ' a moufu ' o ' Greek wi ' ye to speir the richt meanin ' o ' , gin ye maun hae a rizzon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 42]: `` That will do just first-rate , '' said Alec ; `` for here I have been puzzling over a sentence for the last half hour with nobody but this dim-sighted ghost of a Schrevelius to help me out with it .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 5]: I 'll go directly .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 12]: But I look such a blackguard with this game eye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 4]: The landlady laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 13]: `` You 'll sune forget that whan ye see Mr Cupples . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 45]: To the dismay of his nurse , Alec pulled the bandage off his eye , and amidst her expostulations caught up his book , and rushing away , bounded up the garret stairs , which ascended outside the door of the _ flat _ .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 23]: At the top , he found himself under the bare roof , with only boards and slates between him and the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 21]: The landing was lighted by a skylight , across which diligent and undisturbed spiders had woven their webs for years .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 32]: He stood for a moment or two , puzzled as to which door he ought to assail , for all the doors about looked like closet-doors , leading into dingy recesses .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 19]: At last , with the aid of his nose , he made up his mind , and knocked .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 12]: `` Come in , '' cried a voice of peculiar tone .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 32]: It reminded Alec of something he could not at all identify , which was not wonderful , seeing it was of itself , heard once before , that it reminded him .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 27]: It was the same voice which , as he walked to the debate , the first night , had warned him not to look at rainbows .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 7]: He opened the door and entered .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 7]: `` What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 27]: said the voice , its source almost invisible in the thick fumes of genuine pigtail , through which it sent cross odours of as genuine Glenlivat .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 29]: `` I want you to help me with a bit of Homer , if you please , Mr Cupples - I 'm not up to Homer yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 31]: `` Do ye think I hae naething ither to do than to grin ' the grandur o ' an auld haythen into spunemate for a young sinner like you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 28]: `` Ye dinna ken what I 'm like , Mr Cupples , '' returned Alec , remembering his landlady 's injunction not to be afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 14]: `` Come athort the reek , and lat 's luik at ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 36]: Alec obeyed , and found the speaker seated by the side of a little fire , in an old easy-chair covered with horsehair ; and while undergoing his scrutiny , took his revenge in kind .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 40]: Mr Cupples was a man who might have been of almost any age from five-and-twenty to fifty -- at least , Alec 's experience was insufficient for the task of determining to what decade of human years he belonged .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 20]: He was a little man , in a long black tail-coat much too large , and dirty gray trousers .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 19]: He had no shirt-collar visible , although a loose rusty stock revealed the whole of his brown neck .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 44]: His hair , long , thin , fair , and yet a good deal mingled with grey , straggled about over an uncommonly high forehead , which had somehow the neglected and ruinous look of an old bare tower no ivy had beautified .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 10]: His ears stood far out from his great head .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 7]: His nose refuses to be described .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 28]: His lips were plentiful and loose ; his chin was not worth mentioning ; his eyes were rather large , beautifully formed , bright , and blue .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 46]: His hand , small , delicately shaped , and dirty , grasped , all the time he was examining Alec , a tumbler of steaming toddy ; while his feet , in list slippers of different colours , balanced themselves upon the fender -LSB- . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 11]: `` You 've been fighting , you young rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 21]: said Mr Cupples , in a tone of authority , the moment he had satisfied himself about Alec 's countenance .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 6]: `` That wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 6]: It 's not respectable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 8]: And he gave the queerest unintelligible grin .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 33]: Alec found himself strangely attracted to him , and impelled -- a feeling not unfrequent with him -- to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 35]: `` The world itself is n't the most respectable planet in the system , Mr Cupples , '' said he ; `` and no honest inhabitant of it can be always respectable either . ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 18]: Mr Cupples chuckled and laughed groggily , muttering somewhere in his chest -- `` You young dog !
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 7]: there 's stuff in you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 19]: Then composing himself a little , he said aloud : `` Tell me all about it directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 19]: Alec obeyed , and , not without emotion , gave Mr Cupples the whole history of the affair .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 5]: `` Damn you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 27]: remarked Mr Cupples in a husky voice , as he held out a trembling hand to Alec , `` you 're one of the right sort .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 9]: I 'll do anything for you I can .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 6]: Where 's your Homer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 16]: So saying , he rose with care and went towards a cupboard in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 85]: His pipe had been so far interrupted during their conversation , that Alec was now able , by the light of the tallow candle , to see the little garret room , with its ceiling on one side sloping nearly to the floor , its walls begrimed with smoke , and the bare plaster covered with grotesque pencil-drawings -- caricatures of Homeric heroes in the guise of schoolboys , polemic clergymen of the city in the garb of fish-wives militant , and such like .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 38]: A bed and a small chest of drawers stood under the slope of the roof , and the rest of the room was occupied by a painted table covered with papers , and a chair or two .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 11]: An old broadsword leaned against the wall in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 13]: A half-open cupboard revealed bottles , glasses , and a dry-looking cheese .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 46]: To the corresponding cupboard , on the other side of the fire , which had lost a corner by the descent of the roof , Mr Cupples now dragged his slippers , feeling in his waistcoat pocket , as he went , for the key .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 16]: -- There was another door still , partly sunk in the slope of the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 24]: When he opened the cupboard , a dusky glimmer of splendid bindings filling the whole recess , shone out upon the dingy room .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 46]: From a shelf he took a volume of Homer , bound in vellum , with red edges -- a copy of far greater value than Alec had knowledge of books to understand -- and closing the door again , resumed his seat in the easy-chair .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 35]: Having found the passage , he read it through aloud in a manner which made Homer for the first time sound like poetry in Alec 's ears , and almost revealed the hidden significance .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 29]: Then pouncing at once upon the shadowy word which was the key to the whole , he laid open the construction and meaning in one sentence of explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 4]: `` Thank you !
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 4]: thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 3]: exclaimed Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 12]: `` I see it all now as plain as English . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 10]: `` Stop , stop , my young bantam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 4]: said Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 21]: `` Do n't think you 're going to break into my privacy and get off with the booty so cheaply .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 10]: Just you construe the whole sentence to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 23]: Alec did so tolerably well ; for the passage was only an easy extract , the class not having reached Homer yet .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 47]: Mr Cupples put several questions to him , which gave him more insight into Greek than a week 's work in the class would have done , and ended with a small lecture suggested by the passage , drinking away at his toddy all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 8]: The lecture and the toddy ended together .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 29]: Turning his head aside , where it lay back in the horse-hair chair , he said sleepily : `` Go away -- I do n't know your name .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 8]: -- Come and see me to-morrow night .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 6]: I 'm drunk now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 33]: Alec rose , made some attempt at thanks , received no syllable of reply , and went out , closing the door behind him , and leaving Mr Cupples to his dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 13]: His countenance had not made much approximation to respectability before the Monday .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 34]: He therefore kept it as well as he could out of Mr Fraser 's sight , to whom he did not wish to give explanations to the prejudice of any of his fellow-students .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 29]: Mr Fraser , however , saw his black eye well enough , but was too discreet to ask questions , and appeared quite unaware of the transitory blemish .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 27]: Meantime , at Glamerton the winter passed very much like former winters to all but three -- Mrs Forbes , Annie Anderson , and Willie Macwha .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 9]: To these the loss of Alec was dreary .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 12]: So they were in a manner compelled to draw closer together .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 61]: At school , Curly assumed the protectorship of Annie which had naturally devolved upon him , although there was now comparatively little occasion for its exercise ; and Mrs Forbes , finding herself lonely in her parlour during the long _ forenights _ , got into the habit of sending Mary at least three times a week to fetch her .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 33]: This was not agreeable to the Bruce , but the kingly inheritor abode his hour ; and Mrs Forbes had no notion of the amount of offence she gave by doing so .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 16]: That parlour at Howglen was to Annie a little heaven hollowed out of the winter .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 41]: The warm curtains drawn , and the fire blazing defiantly , -- the angel with the flaming sword to protect their Paradise from the frost , it was indeed a contrast to the sordid shop , and the rat-haunted garret .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 13]: After tea they took it in turns to work and to read .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 58]: Mrs Forbes had never sought to satisfy the religious public as to the state of her mind , and so had never been led astray into making frantic efforts to rouse her own feelings ; which is , in fact , to apply to them the hottest searing iron of all , next to that of sin .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 16]: Hence her emotional touch remained delicate , and what she could understand she could feel .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 62]: The good books she liked best were stories of the Scotch Covenanters and Worthies , whose example , however much of stiff-neckedness may have mingled with their devotion , was yet the best that Annie could have , inasmuch as they were simply martyrs -- men who would not say _ yes _ when they ought to say _ no _ .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 20]: Nor was Mrs Forbes too religious to enjoy the representation given of these Covenanters in _ Old Mortality _ .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 51]: Her feelings found nothing repulsive in the book , although she never discovered the reason in the fact that Sir Walter 's feelings were the same as her own , whatever his opinions might be , and had given the chief colour and tone to the representation of his characters .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 45]: There were more books in the house than was usual even in that of a _ gentleman farmer _ ; and several of Sir Walter 's novels , besides some travels , and a little Scotch history , were read between them that winter .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 10]: In poetry , Annie had to forage for herself .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 12]: Mrs Forbes could lend her no guiding hand in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 9]: The bond between them grew stronger every day .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 63]: Annie was to Mrs Forbes an outlet for her maternity , which could never have outlet enough without a girl as well as a boy to love ; and Annie , in consequence , was surrounded by numberless holy influences , which , operating in a time when she was growing fast , had their full effect upon mind and body both .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 15]: In a condition of rapid change , the mass is more yielding and responsive .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 31]: One result in her was , that a certain sober grace , like that of the lovely dull-feathered hen-birds , began to manifest itself in her carriage and her ways .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 53]: And this leads me to remark that her outward and visible feathers would have been dull enough had not Mrs Forbes come to her aid with dresses of her own , which they remade between them ; for it will easily be believed that no avoidable outlay remained unavoided by the Bruces .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 33]: Indeed , but for the feeling that she must be decent on Sundays , they would have let her go yet shabbier than she was when Mrs Forbes thus partially adopted her .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 23]: Now that she was warmly and neatly dressed , she began to feel and look more like the lady-child she really was .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 43]: No doubt the contrast was very painful when she returned from Mrs Forbes 's warm parlour to sleep in her own garret , with the snow on the roof , scanty clothing on the bed , and the rats in the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 26]: But there are two sides to a contrast ; and it is wonderful also how one gets through what one can not get out of .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 19]: A certain change in the Bruce-habits , leading to important results for Annie , must now be recorded .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 14]: Robert Bruce was making money , but not so fast as he wished .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 15]: For his returns came only in small sums , although the profits were great .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 31]: His customers were chiefly of the poorer classes of the town and the neighbourhood , who preferred his unpretending shop to the more showy establishments of some of his rivals .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 34]: A sort of _ couthy _ , _ pauky _ , confidentially flattering way that he had with them , pleased them , and contributed greatly to keep them true to his counter .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 38]: And as he knew how to buy as well as how to sell , the poor people , if they had not the worth of their money , had at least what was good of its sort .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 23]: But , as I have said , although he was making haste to be rich , he was not succeeding fast enough .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 15]: So he bethought him that the Missionar Kirk was getting `` verra throng . ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 80]: A month or two before this time , the Missionars had made choice of a very able man for their pastor -- a man of genuine and strong religious feeling , who did not allow his theology to interfere with the teaching given him by God 's Spirit more than he could help , and who , if he had been capable of making a party at all , would have made it with the poor against the rich .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 46]: This man had gathered about him a large congregation of the lower classes of Glamerton ; and Bruce had learned with some uneasiness that a considerable portion of his customers was to be found in the Missionar Kirk on Sundays , especially in the evenings .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 46]: For there was a grocer amongst the Missionars , who , he feared , might draw some of his subjects away from their allegiance , seeing he must have a certain religious influence of which Robert was void , to bring to bear upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 12]: What therefore remained but that he too should join the congregation ?
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 21]: For then he would not only retain the old , but have a chance of gaining new customers as well .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 75]: So he took a week to think about it , a Sunday to hear Mr Turnbull in order that the change might not seem too abrupt , and a pew under the gallery before the next Sunday arrived ; in which , five minutes before the hour , he and his family were seated , adding greatly to the consequence both of the place and of himself in the eyes of his Missionar customers .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 11]: This change was a source of much pleasure to Annie .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 81]: For although she found the service more wearisome than good Mr Cowie 's , lasting as it did about three quarters of an hour longer and the sermon was not invariably of a kind in which she could feel much interest , yet , occasionally , when Mr Turnbull was in his better moods , and testified of that which he had himself seen and known , the honest heart of the maiden recognized the truth , and listened absorbed .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 90]: The young Bruces , for their parts , would gladly have gone to sleep , which would perhaps have been the most profitable use to which they could put the time ; but they were kept upright and in a measure awake , by the constant application , `` spikewise , '' of the paternal elbow , and the judicious administration , on the part of the mother , of the unfailing peppermint lozenges , to which in the process of ages a certain sabbatical character has attached itself .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 26]: To Annie , however , no such ministration extended , for it would have been downright waste , seeing she could keep awake without it .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 114]: One bright frosty morning , the sermon happening to have no relation to the light around or within them , but only to the covenant made with Abraham -- such a legal document constituting the only reliable protection against the character , inclinations , and duties of the Almighty , whose uncovenanted mercies are of a very doubtful nature -- Annie , neither able to enter into the subject , nor to keep from shivering with the cold , tried to amuse herself with gazing at one brilliant sun-streak on the wall , which she had discovered to be gradually shortening itself , and retreating towards the window by which it had entered .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 93]: Wondering how far it would have moved before the sermon was over , and whether it would have shone so very bright if God had made no covenant with Abraham , she was earnestly watching it pass from spot to spot , and from cobweb to cobweb , as if already it fled before the coming darkness of the long winter night , when she caught a glimpse of a very peculiar countenance turned in the same direction -- that is , not towards the minister , but towards this travelling light .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 56]: She thought the woman was watching it as well as she , and wondered whether she too was hoping for a plate of hot broth as soon as the sunbeam had gone a certain distance -- broth being the Sunday fare with the Bruces -- and , I presume , with most families in Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 41]: The countenance was very plain , seamed and scarred as if the woman had fallen into the fire when a child ; and Annie had not looked at her two seconds , before she saw that she was perfectly blind .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 67]: Indeed she thought at first that she had no eyes at all ; but as she kept gazing , fascinated with the strangeness and ugliness of the face , she discovered that the eyelids , though incapable of separating , were inconstant motion , and that a shrunken eye-ball underneath each kept rolling and turning ever , as if searching for something it could not find .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 38]: She saw too that there was a light on the face , a light which came neither from the sun in the sky , nor the sunbeam on the wall , towards which it was unconsciously turned .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 61]: I think it must have been the heavenly bow itself , shining upon all human clouds -- a bow that had shone for thousands of ages before ever there was an Abraham , or a Noah , or any other of our faithless generation , which will not trust its God unless he swear that he will not destroy them .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 6]: It was the ugliest face .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 22]: But over it , as over the rugged channel of a sea , flowed the transparent waves of a heavenly delight .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 45]: When the service was over , almost before the words of the benediction had left the minister 's lips , the people , according to Scotch habit , hurried out of the chapel , as if they could not possibly endure one word more .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 54]: But Annie , who was always put up to the top of the pew , because there , by reason of an intruding pillar , it required a painful twist of the neck to see the minister , stood staring at the blind woman as she felt her way out of the chapel .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 13]: There was no fear of putting her out by staring at her .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 48]: When , at length , she followed her into the open air , she found her standing by the door , turning her sightless face on all sides , as if looking for some one and trying hard to open her eyes that she might see better .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 31]: Annie watched her , till , seeing her lips move , she knew , half by instinct , that she was murmuring , `` The bairn 's forgotten me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 28]: Thereupon she glided up to her and said gently : `` If ye 'll tell me whaur ye bide , I s ' tak ye hame . ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 13]: `` What do they ca ' _ you _ , bairn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 26]: returned the blind woman , in a gruff , almost manlike voice , hardly less unpleasant to hear than her face was to look at .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 8]: `` Annie Anderson , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 5]: `` Ow , ay !
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 5]: I thoucht as muckle .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 7]: I ken a ' aboot ye .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 10]: Gie 's a haud o ' yer han ' .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 22]: I bide i ' that wee hoosie down at the brig , atween the dam and the Glamour , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 11]: Ye 'll haud me aff o ' the stanes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 9]: `` Ay will I. '' answered Annie confidently .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 26]: `` I could gang my lane , but I 'm growin some auld noo , and I 'm jist raither feared for fa'in ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 17]: `` What garred ye think it was me -- I never spak till ye afore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 9]: asked Annie , as they walked on together .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 30]: `` Weel , it 's jist half guissin ' , an ' half a kin ' o ' jeedgment -- pittin things thegither , ye ken , my bairn .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 18]: Ye see , I kent a ' the bairns that come to oor kirk weel eneuch already .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 12]: I ken the word and amaist the fit o ' them .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 15]: And I had heard tell ` at Maister Bruce was come to oor kirk .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 32]: Sae when a lassie spak till me ` at I never saw afore , I jist a kin ' o ' kent ` at it bude to be yersel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 30]: All this was spoken in the same harsh voice , full of jars , as if ever driving against corners , and ready to break into a hoarse whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 30]: But the woman held Annie 's hand kindly , and yielded like a child to her guidance which was as careful as that of the angel that led Peter .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 92]: It was a new delight to Annie to have some one to whom she a child could be a kind of mother , towards whom she could fulfil a woman 's highest calling -- that of _ ministering unto _ ; and it was with something of a sacred pride that she led her safe home , through the snowy streets , and down the steep path that led from the level of the bridge , with its three high stone arches , to the little meadow where her cottage stood .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 65]: Before they reached it , the blind woman , whose name was Tibbie -LRB- Isobel -RRB- Dyster , had put many questions to her , and without asking one indiscreet , had yet , by her gift for fitting and fusing things in the retort of her own brain , come to a tolerably correct knowledge of her character , circumstances , and history .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 15]: As soon as they entered the cottage , Tibbie was entirely at her ease .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 32]: The first thing she did was to lift the kettle from the fire , and feel the fire with her hands in order to find out in what condition it was .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 30]: She would not allow Annie to touch it : she could not trust the creature that had nothing but eyes to guide her , with such a delicate affair .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 28]: Her very hands looked blind and trying to see , as , with fine up-curved tips , they went wandering over the tops of the live peats .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 39]: She re-arranged them , put on some fresh pieces , blew a little at them all astray and to no purpose , was satisfied , coughed , and sank upon a chair , to put her bonnet off .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 73]: Most women of her station wore only a _ mutch _ or close cap , but Tibbie wore a bonnet with a brilliantly gay ribbon , so fond was she of bright colours , although she had nothing but the testimony of others , vague enough ere it succeeded in crossing the dark distances of her brain , as to the effect of those even with which she adorned her own person .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 18]: Her room was very bare , but as clean as it was possible for room to be .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 25]: Her bed was in the wall which divided it from the rest of the house , and this one room was her whole habitation .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 25]: The other half of the cottage was occupied by an old cripple , nearly bedridden , to whose many necessities Tibbie used to minister .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 38]: The eyes of the one and the legs of the other worked in tolerable harmony ; and if they had a quarrel now and then , it was no greater than gave a zest to their intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 12]: These particulars , however , Annie did not learn till afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 28]: She looked all about the room , and seeing no sign of any dinner for Tibbie , was reminded thereby that her own chance had considerably diminished .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 13]: `` I maun awa hame , '' she said with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 16]: `` Ay , lassie ; they 'll be bidin ' their denner for ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 39]: `` Na , nae fear o ' that , '' answered Annie , adding with another little sigh , `` I doot there winna be muckle o ' the broth to the fore or I win hame . ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 20]: `` Weel jist bide , bairn , an ' tak ' a cup o ' tay wi ' me .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 12]: It 's a ' ` at I hae to offer ye .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 5]: Will ye bide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 15]: `` Maybe I wad be i ' yer gait , '' objected Annie feebly .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 11]: `` Na , na ; nae fear o ' that .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 10]: Ye 'll read a bit to me efterhin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 25]: `` Ay will I. '' And Annie stayed all the afternoon with Tibbie , and went home with the Bruces after the evening service .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 11]: This was the beginning of her acquaintance with Tibbie Dyster .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 33]: It soon grew into a custom for Annie to take Tibbie home from the chapel -- a custom which the Bruces could hardly have objected to , had they been so inclined .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 36]: But they were not so inclined , for it saved the broth -- that is , each of them got a little more in consequence , and Annie 's absence was therefore a Sabbath blessing .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 21]: Much as she was neglected at home , however , Annie was steadily gaining a good reputation in the town .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 81]: Old men said she was a gude bairn , and old women said she was a douce lassie ; while those who enjoyed finding fault more than giving praise , turned their silent approbation of Annie into expressions of disapproval of the Bruces -- `` lattin ' her gang like a beggar , as gin she was no kith or kin o ' theirs , whan it 's weel kent whase heifer Rob Bruce is plooin ' wi ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 36]: But Robert nevertheless grew and prospered all day , and dreamed at night that he was the king , digging the pits for the English cavalry , and covering them again with the treacherous turf .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 7]: Somehow the dream never went further .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 30]: The field and the kingship would vanish and he only remain , the same Robert Bruce , the general dealer , plotting still , but in his own shop .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIX .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 39]: Responsive to Mr Cupples 's last words uttered from the brink of the pit into which his spirit was sinking , and probably forgotten straightway , Alec knocked at his door upon the Sunday evening , and entered .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 25]: The strange creature was sitting in the same position as before , looking as if he had not risen since he spoke those words .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 24]: But there was an alteration in the place , a certain Sunday look about the room , which Alec could not account for .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 46]: The same caricatures jested from the walls ; the same tumbler of toddy was steaming on the table amidst the same litter of books and papers covered with the same dust and marked with the same circles from the bottoms of wet tumblers and glasses .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 16]: The same cutty-clay , of enviable blackness , reposed between the teeth of Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 39]: After he had been seated for a few moments , however , Alec all at once discovered the source of the reformation-look of the place : Mr Cupples had on a shirt-collar -- clean and of imposing proportions .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 30]: To this no doubt was attached a shirt , but as there was no further sign of its presence , it could not have affected the aspect of things .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 122]: Although , however , this shirt-collar was no doubt the chief cause of the change of expression in the room , Alec , in the course of the evening , discovered further signs of improvement in the local morals ; one , that the hearth had been cleared of a great heap of ashes , and now looked modest and moderate as if belonging to an old maid 's cottage , instead of an old bachelor 's garret ; and another , that , upon the untidy table , lay an open book of divinity , a volume of Gurnall 's _ Christian Armour _ namely , which I fear Mr Cupples had chosen more for its wit than its devotion .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 35]: While making these discoveries , Alec chanced to observe -- he was quick-eyed -- that some of the dusty papers on the table were scrawled over with the first amorphous appearance of metrical composition .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 29]: These moved his curiosity ; for what kind of poetry could the most unpoetic-looking Mr Cupples produce from that great head of his with the lanky colourless hair ?
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 13]: -- But meantime we must return to the commencement of the interview .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 8]: `` Ony mair Greek , laddie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 4]: asked Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 12]: `` No , thank you , sir , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 8]: `` I only came to see you .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 9]: You told me to come again to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 4]: `` Did I ?
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 6]: Well , it may stand .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 24]: But I protest against being made accountable for anything that fellow Cupples may choose to say when I 'm not at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 16]: Here he emptied his glass of toddy , and filled it again from the tumbler .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 7]: `` Shall I go away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 6]: asked Alec , half bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 8]: `` No , no ; sit still .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 11]: You 're a good sort of innocent , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 9]: I wo n't give you any toddy though .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 10]: You need n't look so greedy at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 10]: `` I do n't want any toddy , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 10]: I never drank a tumbler in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 39]: `` For God 's sake , '' exclaimed Mr Cupples , with sudden energy , leaning forward in his chair , his blue eyes flashing on Alec -- `` for God 's sake , never drink a drop .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 3]: -- Rainbows .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 3]: Rainbows . ''
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 17]: These last two words were spoken after a pause , and in a tone of sadness .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 13]: Alec thought he was drunk again , and half rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 12]: `` Dinna gang yet , '' said Mr Cupples , authoritatively .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 14]: `` Ye come at yer ain will : ye maun gang at mine .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 13]: -- Gin I cud but get a kick at that fellow Cupples !
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 8]: But I declare I canna help it .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 13]: Gin I war God , I wad cure him o ' drink .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 11]: It 's the verra first thing I wad do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 13]: Alec could not help being shocked at the irreverence of the words .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 13]: But the solemnity of Mr Cupples 's face speedily dissipated the feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 16]: Suddenly changing his tone , he went on : `` What 's your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 5]: `` Alec Forbes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 4]: `` Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 7]: I 'll try to remember it .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 9]: I seldom remember anybody 's name , though .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 6]: I sometimes forget my own .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 13]: What was the fellow 's name you thrashed the other day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 4]: `` Patrick Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 8]: I did not mention it before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 7]: `` The deevil it was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 9]: exclaimed Mr Cupples , half-starting from his seat .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 13]: `` Did ye gie him a _ richt _ thrashin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 10]: `` I think he had the worst of it .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 8]: He gave in , any way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 8]: `` He comes of a bad lot !
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 6]: I know all about them .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 17]: They 're from Strathspey , where my father came from -- at least his father was .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 14]: If the young fellow turns out well , it 'll be a wonder .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 9]: I 'll tell you all about them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 35]: Mr Cupples here launched into a somewhat discursive account of Patrick Beauchamp 's antecedents , indicating by its minuteness that there must have been personal relations of some kind between them or their families .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 23]: Perhaps he glanced at something of the sort when he said that old Beauchamp was a hard man even for a lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 32]: I will condense the story from the more diffuse conversational narrative , interrupted by question and remark on the part of Alec , and give it the shape of formal history .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 38]: Beauchamp 's mother was the daughter of a Highland chief , whose pedigree went back to an Irish king of date so remote that his existence was doubtful to every one not personally interested in the extraction .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 17]: Mrs Beauchamp had all the fierceness without much of the grace belonging to the Celtic nature .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 60]: Her pride of family , even , had not prevented her from revenging herself upon her father , who had offended her , by running away with a handsome W.S. , who , taken with her good looks , and flattered by the notion of overcoming her pride , had found a conjunction of circumstances favourable to the conquest .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 14]: It was not long , however , before both repented of the step .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 79]: That her father should disown her was not of much consequence in any point of view , but that nobody in Edinburgh would admit her claims to distinction -- which arose from the fact that they were so unpleasantly asserted that no one could endure herself -- did disgust her considerably ; and her annoyance found vent in abuse of her husband for having failed to place her in the sphere to which she had a just claim .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 41]: The consequence was , that he neglected her ; and she sat at home brooding over her wrongs , despising and at length hating her husband , and meditating plans of revenge as soon as her child should be born .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 28]: At length , within three months after the birth of Patrick , she found that he was unfaithful to her , and immediately demanded a separate maintenance .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 12]: To this her husband made no further objection than policy required .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 27]: But when she proceeded to impose an oath upon him that he would never take her child from her , the heart of the father demurred .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 24]: Whereupon she swore that , if ever he made the attempt , she would poison the child rather than that he should succeed .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 16]: He turned pale as death , and she saw that she had gained her point .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 44]: And , indeed , the woman was capable of anything to which she had made up her mind -- a power over one 's self and friends not desirable except in view of such an object as that of _ Lady Macbeth _ .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 32]: But Mrs Beauchamp , like her , considered it only a becoming strength of spirit , and would have despised herself if she had broken one resolution for another indubitably better .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 32]: So her husband bade her farewell , and made no lamentation except over the probable result of such training as the child must receive at the hands of such a mother .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 61]: She withdrew to a country town not far from the Moray Frith , where she might live comfortably on her small income , be a person of some consideration , and reap all the advantages of the peculiar facilities which the place afforded for the education of her boy , whom she would mould and model after her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 14]: `` So you see , Mr -- I forget yer name -- Forbes ?
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 27]: yes , Forbes , if the rascal takes after his mother , you have made a dangerous enemy , '' said Mr Cupples , in conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 3]: Alec laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 24]: `` I advise you , '' resumed Mr Cupples , `` to keep a gleg ee in yer heid , though -- seriously .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 7]: A body may lauch ower aften .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 10]: It winna do to gang glowerin ' at rainbows .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 11]: They 're bonnie things , but they 're nae brig-backs .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 18]: Gin ye lippen to them , ye 'll be i ' the water in a cat-loup . ''
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 12]: Alec was beginning to enter into the humour of the man .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 28]: `` I see something like poetry lying about the table , Mr Cupples , '' said he , with a sly allusion to the _ rainbows _ .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 10]: `` Would you let me look at it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 18]: Mr Cupples glanced at him sharply ; but replied immediately : `` Broken bits o ' them !
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 22]: And the rainbows cast -LRB- lose colour -RRB- awfu ' , ance ye tak ' the key-stane oot o ' them .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 39]: Lat them sit up there , brigs -LRB- bridges -RRB- ower naething , wi ' nae road upo ' the tap o ' them , like the stane brig o ' Drumdochart efter the spate -LRB- flood -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 18]: Haud yer han 's and yer een aff o ' them , as I tellt ye afore .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 15]: -- Ay , ay , ye can luik at thae screeds gin ye like .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 13]: Only dinna say a word to me aboot ony o ' them .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 26]: And tak ' warnin ' by them yersel , never to write ae word o ' poetry , to haud ye frae rivin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 9]: `` Sma ' fear o ' that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 5]: returned Alec , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 7]: `` Weel , I houp sae .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 18]: -- Ye can mak a kirk an ' a mill o ' them , gin ye like .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 7]: They hae lain there lang eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 6]: Noo , haud yer tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 16]: I 'm gaein to fill my pipe again , afore I burn oot the dottle .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 23]: I winna drink mair the nicht , cause it 's the Sabbath , and I 'm gaein to read my buik . ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 33]: So saving , he proceeded to get the _ dottle _ out of his pipe , by knocking it on the hob ; while Alec took up the paper that lay nearest .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 34]: He found it contained a fragment of a poem in the Scotch language ; and , searching amongst the rest of the scattered sheets , he soon got the whole of it together .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 57]: Now , although Alec had but little acquaintance with verse , he was able , thanks to Annie Anderson , to enjoy a ballad very heartily ; and there was something in this one which , associating itself in his mind with the strange being before him , moved him more than he could account for .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 7]: It was called TIME AND TIDE .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 31]: As I was walkin ' on the strand , I spied an auld man sit On ane auld rock ; and aye the waves Cam washin ' to its fit .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 16]: And aye his lips gaed mutterin ' , And his ee was dull and blae .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 60]: As I cam near , he luik 'd at me , But this was a ' his say : `` Robbie and Jeannie war twa bonnie bairns , And they played thegither upo ' the shore : Up cam the tide ` tween the mune and the sterns , And pairtit the twa wi ' an eerie roar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 19]: What can the auld man mean , quo ' I , Sittin ' upo ' the auld rock ?
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 19]: The tide creeps up wi ' moan and cry , And a hiss ` maist like a mock .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 33]: The words he mutters maun be the en ' O ' a weary dreary sang -- A deid thing floatin ' in his brain , That the tide will no lat gang .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 41]: `` Robbie and Jeannie war twa bonnie bairns , And they played thegither upo ' the shore : Up cam the tide ` tween the mune and the sterns , And pairtit the twa wi ' an eerie roar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 7]: What pairtit them , auld man ?
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 11]: I said ; Did the tide come up ower strang ?
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 15]: 'T was a braw deith for them that gaed , Their troubles warna lang .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 18]: Or was ane ta'en , and the ither left -- Ane to sing , ane to greet ?
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 19]: It 's sair , richt sair , to be bereft , But the tide is at yer feet .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 41]: `` Robbie and Jeannie war twa bonnie bairns , And they played thegither upo ' the shore : Up cam the tide ` tween the mune and the sterns , And pairtit the twa wi ' an eerie roar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 36]: Maybe , quo ' I , 't was Time 's gray sea , Whase droonin ' 's waur to bide ; But Death 's a diver , seekin ' ye Aneath its chokin ' tide .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 15]: And ye 'll luik in ane anither 's ee Triumphin ' ower gray Time .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 57]: But never a word he answered me , But ower wi ' his dreary chime -- `` Robbie and Jeannie war twa bonnie bairns , And they played thegither upo ' the shore : Up cam the tide ` tween the mune and the sterns , And pairtit the twa wi ' an eerie roar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 17]: Maybe , auld man , said I , 't was Change That crap atween the twa ?
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 2]: Hech !
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 17]: that 's a droonin ' awfu ' strange , Ane waur than ane and a ' .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 5]: He spak nae mair .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 13]: I luik ' t and saw That the auld lips cudna gang .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 56]: The tide unseen took him awa -- Left me to end his sang : `` Robbie and Jeannie war twa bonnie bairns , And they played thegither upo ' the shore : Up cam the tide ` tween the mune and the sterns , And tuik them whaur pairtin ' shall be no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 33]: Before he had finished reading , the refrain had become so familiar to Alec , that he unconsciously murmured the last , changed as it was from the preceding form , aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 22]: Mr Cupples looked up from Gurnall uneasily , fidgeted in his chair , and said testily : `` A ' nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 4]: Moonshine and rainbows !
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 4]: Haud yer tongue !
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 9]: The last line 's a ' wrang . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 64]: He then returned with a determined air to the consideration of his _ Christian Armour _ , while Alec , in whom the minor tone of the poem had greatly deepened the interest he felt in the writer , gazed at him in a bewilderment like that one feels when his eyes refuse to take their proper relation to the perspective before them .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 12]: He could not get those verses and Mr Cupples into harmony .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 41]: Not daring to make any observation , however , he sat with the last leaf still in his hand , and a reverential stare upon his face , which at length produced a remarkable effect upon the object of it .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 16]: Suddenly lifting his eyes -- `` What are ye glowerin ' at me for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 26]: he exclaimed , flinging his book from him , which , missing the table , fell on the floor on the further side of it .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 8]: `` I 'm neither ghaist nor warlock .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 3]: Damn ye !
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 22]: gang oot , gin ye be gaun to stick me throu and throu wi ' yer een , that gait . ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 9]: `` I beg your pardon , Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 13]: I did n't mean to be rude , '' said Alec humbly .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 17]: `` Weel , cut yer stick , I hae eneuch o ' ye for ae nicht .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 23]: I canna stan ' glowerin ' een , especially i ' the heids o ' idiots o ' innocents like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 39]: I am sorry to have to record what Alec learned from the landlady afterwards , that Mr Cupples went to bed that night , notwithstanding it was the Sabbath , more drunk than she had ever known him .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 52]: Indeed he could not properly be said to have gone to bed at all , for he had tumbled on the counter-pane in his clothes and clean shirt-collar ; where she had found him fast asleep the next morning , with Gurnall 's _ Christian Armour _ terribly crumpled under him .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 16]: `` But , '' said Alec , `` what _ is _ Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 18]: `` That 's a queston he cudna weel answer ye himsel ' , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 77]: `` He does a heap o ' things ; writes for the lawyers whiles ; buys and sells queer buiks ; gies lessons in Greek and Hebrew -- but he disna like that -- he canna bide to be contred , and laddies is gey contresome ; helps onybody that wants help i ' the way o ' figures -- whan their buiks gang wrang ye ken , for figures is some ill for jummlin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 20]: He 's a kin ' o ' librarian at yer ain college i ' the noo , Mr Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 16]: The auld man 's deid , and Mr Cupples is jist doin ' the wark .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 38]: They winna gie him the place -- 'cause he has an ill name for drink -- but they 'll get as muckle wark oot o ' him as gin they did , and for half the siller .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 45]: The body hauds at onythiug weel eneuch a ' day , but the minute he comes hame , oot comes the tappit hen , and he jist sits doon and drinks till he turns the warl upo ' the tap o ' 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 35]: The next day , about noon , Alec went into the library , where he found Mr Cupples busy re-arranging the books and the catalogue , both of which had been neglected for years .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 17]: This was the first of many visits to the library , or rather to the librarian .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 47]: There was a certain mazy sobriety of demeanour about Mr Cupples all day long , as if in the presence of such serious things as books he was bound to be upon his good behaviour , and confine his dissipation to taking snuff in prodigious quantities .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 28]: He was full of information about books , and had , besides , opinions concerning them , which were always ready to assume quaint and decided expression .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 54]: For instance : one afternoon , Alec having taken up _ Tristram Shandy _ and asked him what kind of a book it was , the pro-librarian snatched it from his hands and put it on the shelf again , answering : `` A pailace o ' dirt and impidence and speeeritual stink .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 25]: The clever deevil had his entrails in his breest and his hert in his belly , and regairdet neither God nor his ain mither .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 29]: His lauchter 's no like the cracklin ' o ' thorns unner a pot , but like the nicherin ' o ' a deil ahin ' the wainscot .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 8]: Lat him sit and rot there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 39]: Asking him another day what sort of poet Shelley was , Alec received the answer : `` A bonny cratur , wi ' mair thochts nor there was room for i ' the bit heid o ' 'm .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 21]: Consequently he gaed staiggerin ' aboot as gin he had been tied to the tail o ' an inveesible balloon .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 15]: Unco licht heidit , but no muckle hairm in him by natur ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 14]: He never would remain in the library after the day began to ebb .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 38]: The moment he became aware that the first filmy shadow had fallen from the coming twilight , he caught up his hat , locked the door , gave the key to the sacrist , and hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 24]: The friendly relation between the two struck its roots deeper and deeper during the session , and Alec bade him good-bye with regret .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 93]: Mr Cupples was a baffled poet trying to be a humourist -- baffled -- not by the booksellers or the public -- for such baffling one need not have a profound sympathy -- but baffled by his own weakness , his incapacity for assimilating sorrow , his inability to find or invent a theory of the universe which should show it still beautiful despite of passing pain , of checked aspiration , of the ruthless storms that lay waste the Edens of men , and dissolve the high triumph of their rainbows .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 39]: He had yet to learn that through `` the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to , '' man becomes capable of the blessedness to which all the legends of a golden age point .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 52]: Not finding , when he most needed it , such a theory even in the New Testament -- for he had been diligently taught to read it awry -- Mr Cupples took to jesting and toddy ; but , haunting the doors of Humour , never got further than the lobby .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 42]: With regard to Patrick Beauchamp , as far as Alec could see , his dignity had succeeded in consoling itself for the humiliation it had undergone , by an absolute and eternal renunciation of all knowledge of Alec Forbes 's existence .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 3]: CHAPTER XL .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 16]: Winter had begun to withdraw his ghostly troops , and Glamerton began to grow warmer .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 59]: Not half so many cold feet dangled from the cold legs of little children in the torturing churches ; not half so many coughs tore the chests of the poor old men and women as they stooped over their little fires , with the blasts from door and window-sill in their ankles and the backs of their necks .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 21]: Annie , who had been very happy all the time , began to be aware of something more at hand .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 52]: A flutter scarcely recognizable , as of the wings of awaking delight , would stir her little heart with a sensation of physical presence and motion ; she would find herself giving an involuntary skip as she walked along , and now and then humming a bit of a psalm tune .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 11]: A hidden well was throbbing in the child 's bosom .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 33]: Its waters had been frozen by the winter ; and the spring , which sets all things springing , had made it flow and swell afresh , soon to break bubbling forth .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 43]: But her joy was gentle , for even when she was merriest , it was in a sobor , _ douce _ , and maidenly fashion , testifying that she had already walked with Sorrow , and was not afraid of her .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 43]: Robert Bruce 's last strategical move against the community had been tolerably successful , even in his own eyes ; and he was consequently so far satisfied with himself , that he could afford to be in good humour with other people .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 55]: Annie came in for a share of this humour ; and although she knew him too well to have any regard for him , it was yet a comfort to her to be on such terms with him as not to have to dread a bitter word every time she chanced to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 44]: This comfort , however , stood on a sandy foundation ; for the fact that an expected customer had not called upon the Saturday might be enough to set the acetous fermentation at work all the Sunday in the bosom of Robert Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 28]: At length , one bright day in the end of March , Alec came home , not the worse to friendly eyes for having been at college .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 11]: He seemed the same cheery , active youth as before .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 19]: The chief differences apparent were , that he had grown considerably , and that he wore a coat .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 25]: The hat , at that time a necessary portion of the college costume , he had discarded , wearing his old cap in preference .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 29]: There was likewise a certain indescribable alteration in tone and manner , a certain general crystallization and polish , which the same friends regarded as an indubitable improvement .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 30]: The day after his arrival , crossing the square of Glamerton , he spied , in a group of men talking together , his old friend , Thomas Crann .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 17]: He went up and shook hands with him , and with Andrew Constable , the clothier .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 10]: `` Has na he grown a lang chield ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 9]: said Andrew to Thomas , regarding Alec kindly .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 13]: returned Thomas , `` he 'll jist need the langer coffin . ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 10]: Alec laughed ; but Andrew said , `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 3]: hoot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 7]: Thomas and Alec walked away together .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 42]: But scarcely a sentence had been exchanged before the stonemason , with a delicacy of perception of which his rough manner and horny hands gave no indication , felt that a film of separation had come between the youth and himself .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 19]: Anxious to break through it , he said abruptly , `` Hoo 's yer immortal pairt , Alec ?
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 13]: Min ' ye , there 's a knowledge that worketh deith . ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 10]: Alec laughed -- not scornfully -- but he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 19]: `` Ye may lauch , Alec , but it 's a sair trowth , '' said the mason .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 12]: Alec held out his hand , for here their way diverged .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 10]: Thomas shook it kindly , but walked away gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 20]: Arrived at home , he shut to his door , and went down on his knees by his bedside .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 12]: When Jean came with his supper she found the door fast .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 40]: In order to prepare for the mathematical studies of the following year , Alec went to the school again in the morning of most days , Mr Malison being well able to render him all the assistance he required .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 37]: The first time he made his appearance at the door , a silence as of death was the sign of his welcome ; but a tumult presently arose , and discipline was for a time suspended .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 22]: I am afraid he had a slight feeling of condescension , as he returned the kind greeting of his old companions .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 17]: -- Raise a housemaid to be cook , and she will condescend to the new housemaid .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 16]: Annie sat still , staring at her book , and turning red and pale alternately .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 17]: But he took no notice of her , and she tried to be glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 21]: When school was over , however , he came up to her in the lane , and addressed her kindly .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 26]: But the delicate little maiden felt , as the rough stonemason had felt , that a change had passed over the old companion and friend .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 13]: True , the change was only a breath -- a mere shadow .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 9]: Yet it was a measureless gulf between them .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 14]: Annie went to her garret that night with a sense of sad privation .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 16]: But her pain sprung from a source hardly so deep as that of the stonemason .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 36]: For the change she found in Alec was chiefly of an external kind , and if she had a vague feeling of a deeper change , it had scarcely yet come up into her consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 14]: When she saw the _ young gentleman _ her heart sank within her .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 35]: Her friend was lost ; and a shape was going about , as he did , looking awfully like the old Alec , who had carried her in his arms through the invading torrent .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 36]: Nor was there wanting , to complete the bewilderment of her feeling , a certain additional reverence for the apparition , which she must after all regard as a further development of the same person .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 25]: Mrs Forbes never asked her to the house now , and it was well for her that her friendship with Tibbie Dyster had begun .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 36]: But as she saw Alec day after day at school , the old colours began to revive out of the faded picture -- for to her it was a faded picture , although new varnished .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 41]: And when the spring had advanced a little , the boat was got out , and then Alec could not go rowing in the _ Bonnie Annie _ without thinking of its godmother , and inviting her to join them .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 49]: Indeed Curly would not have let him forget her if he had been so inclined ; for he felt that she was a bond between him and Alec , and he loved Alec the more devotedly that the rift between their social positions had begun to show itself .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 61]: The devotion of the schoolboy to his superior in schoolboy arts had begun to change into something like the devotion of the clansman to his chief -- not the worst folly the world has known -- in fact not a folly at all , except it stop there : many enthusiasms are follies only because they are not greater enthusiasms .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 34]: And not unfrequently would an odd laugh of consciousness between Annie and Curly , unexpectedly meeting , reveal the fact that they were both watching for a peep or a word of Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 31]: In due time the harvest came ; and Annie could no more keep from haunting the harvest than the crane could keep from flying south when the summer is over .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 50]: She watched all the fields around Glamerton ; she knew what response each made to the sun , and which would first be ripe for the reaping ; and the very day that the sickle was put in , there was Annie to see and share in the joy .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 20]: How mysterious she thought those long colonnades of slender pillars , each supporting its own waving comet-head of barley !
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 49]: Or when the sun was high , she would lie down on the ground , and look far into the little forest of yellow polished oat-stems , stretching away and away into the unseen -- alas , so soon to fall , and leave a naked commonplace behind !
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 20]: If she were only small enough to go wandering about in it , what wonders might she not discover !
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 17]: -- But I forget that I am telling a story , and not writing a fairy-tale .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 48]: -- Unquestioned as uninvited , she was , as she had often been before , one of the company of reapers , gatherers , binders , and stookers , assembled to collect the living gold of the earth from the early fields of the farm of Howglen .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 25]: Sadly her thoughts went back to the old days when Dowie was master of the field , and she was Dowie 's little mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 21]: Not that she met with anything but kindness -- only it was not the kindness she had had from Dowie .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 16]: But the pleasure of being once more near Alec almost made up for every loss .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 20]: And he was quite friendly , although , she must confess , not quite so familiar as of old .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 10]: But that did not matter , she assured herself .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 33]: The labourers all knew her , and themselves took care that she should have the portion of their food which her assistance had well earned , and which was all her wages .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 12]: She never refused anything that was offered her , except money .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 33]: That she had taken only once in her life -- from Mr Cowie , whom she continued to love the more dearly for it , although she no longer attended his church .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 25]: But again the harvest was safely lodged , and the sad old age of the year sank through rains and frosts to his grave .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 7]: The winter came and Alec went .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 35]: He had not been gone a week when Mrs Forbes 's invitations re-commenced ; and , as if to make up for the neglect of the summer , they were more frequent than before .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 15]: No time was so happy for Annie as the time she spent with her .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 20]: She never dreamed of accusing her of fickleness or unevenness , but received whatever kindness she offered with gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 18]: And , this winter , she began to make some return in the way of household assistance .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 25]: One day , while searching in the lumber-room for something for Mrs Forbes , she came upon a little book lying behind a box .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 16]: It was damp and swollen and mouldy , and the binding was decayed and broken .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 22]: The inside was dingy and spotted with brown spots , and had too many 's in it , as she thought .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 7]: Yet the first glance fascinated her .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 11]: It had opened in the middle of _ L'Allegro _ .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 32]: Mrs Forbes found her standing spell-bound , reading the rhymed poems of the man whose blank-verse , two years before , she had declined as not what poetry ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 25]: I have often seen a child refuse his food , and , after being compelled to eat one mouthful , gladly devour the whole .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 73]: In like manner Annie , having once tasted Milton 's poetry , did not let it go till she had devoured even the _ Paradise Lost _ , of which when she could not make sense , she at least made music the chords of old John Milton 's organ sounding through his son 's poetry in the brain of a little Scotch lassie who never heard an organ in her life .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLI .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 6]: `` Hillo , bantam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 50]: exclaimed Mr Cupples , to Alec entering his garret within an hour of his arrival in his old quarters , and finding the soul of the librarian still hovering in the steam of his tumbler , like one of Swedenborg 's damned over the odour of his peculiar hell .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 48]: As he spoke he emptied the glass , the custom of drinking from which , instead of from the tumbler itself -- rendering it impossible to get drunk all at once -- is one of the atonements offered by the Scotch to their tutelar god -- Propriety .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 6]: -- `` Come awa ' .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 29]: What are ye stan ` in ' there for , as gin ye warna at hame , '' he added , seeing that Alec lingered on the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 4]: `` Sit doon .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 12]: I 'm nae a ` thegither sorry to see ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 12]: `` Have you been to the country , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 9]: asked Alec , as he took a chair .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 4]: `` The country !
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 10]: Na , I haena been i ' the country .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 5]: I 'm a toon-snail .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 8]: The country 's for calves and geese .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 7]: It 's ower green for me .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 15]: I like the gray stanes -- weel biggit , to haud oot the cauld .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 49]: I jist reverse the opingon o ' the auld duke in Mr Shackspere ; -- for this my life ` Find trees in tongues , its running brooks in books , Stones in sermons , -- ' and I canna gang on ony farther wi ' ` t .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 7]: The last 's true ony gait .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 9]: I winna gie ye ony toddy though . ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 7]: `` I dinna want nane . ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 5]: `` That 's richt .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 16]: Keep to that negation as an anchor o ' the soul , sure and steadfast .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 24]: There 's no boddom to the sea ye 'll gang doon in gin ye cut the cable that hauds ye to that anchor .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 6]: Here 's to ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 8]: And again Mr Cupples emptied his glass .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 10]: `` Hoo are ye prepared for yer mathematics ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 3]: he resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 9]: `` Middlin ' only , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 7]: `` I was doobtin ' that .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 26]: Sma ' preparation does weel eneuch for Professor Fraser 's Greek ; but ye 'll fin ' it 's anither story wi ' the mathematics .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 18]: Ye maun jist come to me wi ' them as ye did wi ' the Greek . ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 12]: `` Thank you , Mr Cupples , '' said Alec heartily .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 11]: `` I do n't know how to repay you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 4]: `` Repay me !
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 5]: I want nae repayment .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 16]: Only spier nae questons at me , and gang awa whan I 'm drunk . ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 39]: After all his summer preparation , Alec was still behind in mathematics ; for while , with a distinct object in view , he was capable of much -- without one , reading was a weariness to him .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 40]: His medical studies , combining , as they did , in their anatomical branch , much to be learned by the eye and the hand with what was to be learned from books , interested him more and more .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 32]: One afternoon , intent upon a certain course of investigation , he remained in the dissecting room after the other students had gone , and worked away till it grew dark .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 10]: He then lighted a candle , and worked on .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 9]: The truth was unfolding itself gently and willingly .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 29]: At last , feeling tired , he laid down his scalpel , dropped upon a wooden chair , and , cold as it was , fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 25]: When he awoke , the candle was _ bobbing _ in its socket , alternately lighting and shadowing the dead man on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 30]: Strange glooms were gathering about the bottles on the shelves , and especially about one corner of the room , where -- but I must not particularize too much .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 21]: It must be remembered that he had awaked suddenly , in a strange place , and with a fitful light .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 21]: He confessed to Mr Cupples that he had felt a little uncomfortable -- not frightened , but _ eerie _ .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 38]: He was just going to rise and go home , when , as he stretched out his hand for his scalpel , the candle sunk in darkness , and he lost the guiding glitter of the knife .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 23]: At the same moment , he caught a doubtful gleam of two eyes looking in at him from one of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 9]: That moment the place became insupportable with horror .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 16]: The vague sense of an undefined presence turned the school of science into a charnel-house .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 43]: He started up , hurried from the room , feeling as if his feet took no hold of the floor and his back was fearfully exposed , locked the door , threw the key upon the porter 's table , and fled .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 32]: He did not recover his equanimity till he found himself in the long narrow street that led to his lodgings , lighted from many little shop-windows in stone gable and front .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 26]: By the time he had had his tea , and learned a new proposition of Euclid , the fright seemed to lie far behind him .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 27]: It was not so far as he thought , however , for he started to his feet when a sudden gust of wind shook his windows .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 19]: But then it was a still frosty night , and such a gust was not to be expected .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 4]: He looked out .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 6]: Far above shone the stars .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 9]: `` How they sparkle in the frost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 10]: he said , as if the frost reached them .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 28]: But they did look like the essential life that makes snow-flakes and icy spangles everywhere -- they were so like them , only they were of fire .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 12]: Even snow itself must have fire at the heart of it .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 8]: -- All was still enough up there .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 26]: Then he looked down into the street , full of the comings and goings of people , some sauntering and staring , others hastening along .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 13]: Beauchamp was looking in at the window of a second-hand book-shop opposite .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 46]: Not being able to compose himself again to his studies , he resolved , as he had not called on Mr Fraser for some time , and the professor had not been at the class that day , to go and inquire after him now .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 32]: Mr Fraser lived in the quadrangle of the college ; but in the mood Alec was in , nothing would do him so much good as a walk in the frost .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 46]: He was sure of a welcome from the old man ; for although Alec gave but little attention to Greek now , Mr Fraser was not at all dissatisfied with him , knowing that he was doing his best to make himself a good doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 44]: His friendliness towards him had increased ; for he thought he saw in him noble qualities ; and now that he was an old man , he delighted to have a youth near him with whose youthfulness he could come into harmonious contact .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 32]: It is because the young can not recognize the youth of the aged , and the old will not acknowledge the experience of the young , that they repel each other .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 9]: Alec was shown into the professor 's drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 4]: This was unusual .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 15]: The professor was seated in an easy-chair , with one leg outstretched before him .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 19]: `` Excuse me , Mr Forbes , '' he said , holding out his left hand without rising .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 15]: `` I am laid up with the gout -- I do n't know why .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 10]: The port wine my grandfather drunk , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 7]: _ I _ never drink it .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 8]: I 'm afraid it 's old age .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 6]: And yon 's my nurse .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 13]: -- Mr Forbes , your cousin , Kate , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 3]: Alec started .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 27]: There , at the other side of the fire , sat a girl , half smiling and half blushing as she looked up from her work .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 10]: The candles between them had hid her from him .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 12]: He advanced , and she rose and held out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 20]: He was confused ; she was perfectly collected , although the colour rose a little more in her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 10]: She might have been a year older than Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 13]: `` So you are a cousin of mine , Mr Forbes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 46]: she said , when they were all seated by the blazing fire -- she with a piece of plain work in her hands , he with a very awkward nothing in his , and the professor contemplating his swathed leg on the chair before him .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 20]: `` So your uncle says , '' he answered , `` and I am very happy to believe him .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 9]: I hope we shall be good friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 5]: Alec was recovering himself .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 23]: `` I hope we shall , '' she responded , with a quick , shy , asking glance from her fine eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 15]: Those eyes were worth looking into , if only as a study of colour .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 8]: They were of many hues marvellously blended .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 17]: I think grey and blue and brown and green were all to be found in them .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 6]: Their glance rather discomposed Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 14]: He had not learned before that ladies ' eyes are sometimes very discomposing .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 26]: Yet he could not keep his from wandering towards them ; and the consequence was that he soon lost the greater part of his senses .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 47]: After sitting speechless for some moments , and feeling as if he had been dumb for as many minutes , he was seized by a horrible conviction that if he remained silent an instant longer , he would be driven to do or say something absurd .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 23]: So he did the latter at once by bursting out with the stupid question , `` What are you working at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 15]: `` A duster , '' she answered instantly -- this time without looking up .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 25]: Now the said duster was of the finest cambric ; so that Alec could not help seeing that she was making game of him .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 12]: This banished his shyness , and put him on his mettle .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 48]: `` I see , '' he said , `` when I ask questions , you -- '' `` Tell lies , '' she interposed , without giving him time even to hesitate ; adding , `` Does your mother answer all your questions , Mr Forbes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 12]: `` I believe she does -- one way or other . ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 9]: `` Then it is sometimes the other way ?
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 5]: Is she nice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 7]: returned Alec , surprised into doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 5]: `` Your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 26]: `` She 's the best woman in the world , '' he answered with vehemence , almost shocked at having to answer such a question .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 31]: I beg your pardon , '' returned Kate , laughing ; and the laugh curled her lip , revealing very pretty teeth , with a semi-transparent pearly-blue shadow in them .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 13]: `` I am glad she is nice , '' she went on .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 8]: `` I should like to know her .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 8]: Mothers are not _ always _ nice .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 15]: I knew a girl at school whose mother was n't nice at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 29]: She did not laugh after this childish speech , but let her face settle into perfect stillness -- sadness indeed , for a shadow came over the stillness .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 36]: Mr Fraser sat watching the two with his amused old face , one side of it twitching in the effort to suppress the smile which sought to break from the useful half of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 11]: His gout could not have been very bad just then .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 19]: `` I see , Katie , what that long chin of yours is thinking , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 10]: `` What is my chin thinking , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 9]: `` That uncles are not always nice either .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 12]: They snub little girls , sometimes , do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 17]: `` I know one who _ is _ nice , all except one naughty leg . ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 27]: She rose , as she said this , and going round to the back of his chair , leaned over it , and kissed his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 9]: The old man looked up to her gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 6]: `` Ah , Katie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 15]: he said , `` you may make game of an old man like me .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 11]: But do n't try your tricks on Mr Forbes there .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 7]: He wo n't stand them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 3]: Alec blushed .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 14]: Kate went back to her seat , and took up her duster again .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 15]: Alec was a little short-sighted , though he had never discovered it till now .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 29]: When Kate leaned over her uncle 's chair , near which he was sitting , he saw that she was still prettier than he had thought her before .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 83]: -- There are few girls who to a short-sighted person look prettier when they come closer ; the fact being that the general intent of the face , which the generalizing effect of the shortness of the sight reveals , has ordinarily more of beauty in it than has yet been carried out in detail ; so that , as the girl approaches , one face seems to melt away , and another , less beautiful , to dawn up through it .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 31]: But , as I have said , this was not Alec 's experience with Kate ; for , whatever it might indicate , she looked prettier when she came nearer .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 68]: He found too that her great mass of hair , instead of being , as he had thought , dull , was in reality full of glints and golden hints , as if she had twisted up a handful of sunbeams with it in the morning , which , before night , had faded a little , catching something of the duskiness and shadowiness of their prison .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 51]: One thing more he saw -- that her hand -- she rested it on the back of the dark chair , and so it had caught his eye -- was small and white ; and those were all the qualities Alec was as yet capable of appreciating in a hand .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 17]: Before she got back to her seat , he was very nearly in love with her .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 18]: I suspect that those generally who fall in love at first sight have been in love before .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 8]: At least such was Romeo 's case .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 8]: And certainly it was not Alec 's .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 35]: Yet I must confess , if he had talked stupidly before , he talked worse now ; and at length went home with the conviction that he had made a great donkey of himself .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 39]: As he walked the lonely road , and the street now fast closing its windows and going to sleep , he was haunted by a very different vision from that which had accompanied him a few hours ago .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 54]: Then it was the dead face of a man , into which his busy fancy had reset the living eyes that he had seen looking in at the window of the dissecting room ; now it was the lovely face of his new-found cousin , possessing him so that he could fear nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 6]: Life had cast out death .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 6]: Love had cast out fear .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 7]: But love had cast out more .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 17]: For he found , when he got home , that he could neither read nor think .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 48]: If Kate could have been _ conscious _ of its persistent intrusion upon Alec 's thoughts , and its constant interruption of his attempts at study , she would have been ashamed of that pretty face of hers , and ready to disown it for its forwardness .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 39]: At last , he threw his book to the other end of the room , and went to bed , where he found it not half so difficult to go to sleep as it had been to study .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 25]: The next day things went better ; for he was not yet so lost that a night 's rest could do him no good .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 24]: But it was fortunate that there was no Greek class , and that he was not called up to read Latin that day .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 39]: For the anatomy , he was in earnest about that ; and love itself , so long as its current is not troubled by opposing rocks , will not disturb the studies of a real student -- much .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 23]: As he left the dissecting-room , he said to himself that he would just look in and see how Mr Fraser was .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 9]: He was shown into the professor 's study .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 29]: Mr Fraser smiled as he entered with a certain grim comicality which Alec 's conscience interpreted into : `` This wo n't do , my young man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 24]: `` I hope your gout is better to-day , sir , '' he said , sending his glance wide astray of his words .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 20]: `` Yes , I thank you , Mr Forbes , '' answered Mr Fraser , `` it is better .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 7]: Wo n't you sit down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 18]: Warned by that smile , Alec was astute enough to decline , and presently took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 27]: As he shut the study door , however , he thought he would just peep into the dining-room , the door of which stood open opposite .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 11]: There she was , sitting at the table , writing .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 9]: `` Who can that letter be to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 3]: thought Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 9]: But it was early days to be jealous .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 10]: `` How do you do , Mr Forbes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 8]: said Kate , holding out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 11]: Could it be that he had seen her only yesterday ?
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 16]: Or was his visual memory so fickle that he had forgotten what she was like ?
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 12]: She was so different from what he had been fancying her !
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 52]: The fact was merely this -- that she had been writing to an old friend , and her manner for the time , as well as her expression , was affected by her mental proximity to that friend ; -- so plastic -- so fluent even -- was her whole nature .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 22]: Indeed Alec was not long in finding out that one of her witcheries was , that she was never the same .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 14]: But on this the first occasion , the alteration in her bewildered him .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 14]: `` I am glad to find your uncle better , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 9]: -- You have seen him , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 20]: I was very busy in the dissecting-room , till -- '' He stopped ; for he saw her shudder .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 12]: `` I beg your pardon , '' he hastened to substitute .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 30]: -- `` We are so used to those things , that -- '' `` Do n't say a word more about it , please , '' she said hastily .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 17]: Then , in a vague kind of way -- `` Wo n't you sit down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 6]: `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 17]: I must go home , '' answered Alec , feeling that she did not want him .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 12]: `` Good night , '' he added , advancing a step .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 22]: `` Good night , Mr Forbes , '' she returned in the same vague manner , and without extending her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 25]: Alec checked himself , bowed , and went with a feeling of mortification , and the resolution not to repeat his visit too soon .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 25]: She interfered with his studies notwithstanding , and sent him wandering in the streets , when he ought to have been reading at home .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 37]: One bright moonlight night he found himself on the quay , and spying a boat at the foot of one of the stairs , asked the man in it if he was ready for a row .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 4]: The man agreed .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 31]: Alec got in , and they rowed out of the river , and along the coast to a fishing village where the man lived , and whence Alec walked home .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 19]: This was the beginning of many such boating excursions made by Alec in the close of this session .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 12]: They greatly improved his boatmanship , and strengthened his growing muscles .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 19]: The end of the winter was mild , and there were not many days unfit for the exercise .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLII .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 33]: The next Saturday but one Alec received a note from Mr Fraser , hoping that his new cousin had not driven him away , and inviting him to dine that same afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 3]: He went .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 11]: After dinner the old man fell asleep in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 7]: `` Where were you born ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 4]: Alec asked Kate .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 10]: She was more like his first impression of her .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 7]: `` Do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 3]: she replied .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 45]: `` In the north of Sutherlandshire -- near the foot of a great mountain , from the top of which , on the longest day , you can see the sun , or a bit of him at least , all night long . ''
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 5]: `` How glorious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 3]: said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 7]: _ I _ never saw him .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 9]: And the winters are so long and terrible !
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 24]: Nothing but snowy hills about you , and great clouds always coming down with fresh loads of snow to scatter over them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 11]: `` Then you do n't want to go back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 11]: There is nothing to make me wish to go back .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 11]: There is no one there to love me now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 9]: She looked very sad for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' said Alec , thoughtfully ; `` a winter without love must be dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 18]: But I like the winter ; and we have plenty of it in our quarter too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 7]: `` Where is your home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 9]: `` Not many miles north of this . ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 8]: `` Is it a nice place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 8]: `` Of course I think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 5]: you have a mother .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 7]: I wish I knew her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 6]: `` I wish you did .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 12]: -- True : the whole place is like her to me .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 10]: But I do n't think everybody would admire it .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 12]: There are plenty of bare snowy hills there too in winter .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 24]: But I think the summers and the harvests are as delightful as anything can be , except -- '' `` Except what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 15]: `` Do n't make me say what will make you angry with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 20]: `` Now you must , else I shall fancy something that will make me _ more _ angry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 23]: `` Except your face , then , '' said Alec , frightened at his own boldness , but glancing at her shyly .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 11]: She flushed a little , but did not look angry .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 11]: `` I do n't like that , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 8]: `` It makes one feel awkward . ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 21]: `` At least , '' rejoined Alec , emboldened , `` you must allow it is your own fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 14]: `` I ca n't help my face , '' she said , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 6]: you know what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 7]: You made me say it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 10]: `` Yes , after you had half-said it already .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 7]: Do n't do it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 14]: And there followed more of such foolish talk , uninteresting to my readers .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 8]: `` Where were you at school ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 7]: asked Alec , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 11]: `` Your uncle told me you were at school . ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 8]: `` Near London , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 8]: that accounts for your beautiful speech . ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 4]: `` There again .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 16]: I declare I will wake my uncle if you go on in that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 15]: `` I beg your pardon , '' protested Alec ; `` I forgot . ''
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 23]: `` But , '' she went on , `` in Sutherlandshire we do n't talk so horribly as they do here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 11]: `` I daresay not , '' returned Alec , humbly .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 7]: `` I do n't mean you .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 18]: I wonder how it is that you speak so much better than all the people here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 9]: `` I suppose because my mother speaks well .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 11]: She never lets me speak broad Scotch to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 5]: `` Your mother again !
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 7]: She 's everything to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 5]: Alec did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 14]: `` I _ should _ like to see her , '' pursued Kate .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 11]: `` You must come and see her , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 5]: `` See whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 10]: asked Mr Fraser , rousing himself from his nap .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 10]: `` My mother , sir , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 21]: I thought you had been speaking of Katie 's friend , '' said the professor , and fell asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 17]: `` Uncle means Bessie Warner , who is coming by the steamer from London on Monday .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 17]: Is n't it kind of uncle to ask her to come and see me here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 6]: `` He is kind always .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 9]: Was Miss Warner a schoolfellow of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 8]: `` Yes -- no -- not exactly .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 7]: She was one of the governesses .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 12]: I _ must _ go and meet her at the steamer .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 7]: Will you go with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 6]: `` I shall be delighted .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 8]: Do you know when she arrives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 6]: `` They say about six .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 9]: I daresay it is not very punctual . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 11]: yes , she is -- when the weather is decent .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 12]: I will make inquiries , and come and fetch you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 9]: -- I suppose I may , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 7]: `` What , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 8]: said the professor , rousing himself again .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 17]: `` Have my cousin to take care of me when I go to meet Bessie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 5]: `` Yes , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 11]: I shall be much obliged to you , Mr Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 23]: I am not quite so agile as I was at your age , though my gouty leg _ is _ better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 23]: This conversation would not have been worth recording were it not that it led to the walk and the waiting on Monday .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 30]: -- They found , when they reached the region of steamers , that she had not yet been signalled , but her people were expecting the signal every minute .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 15]: So Alec and Kate walked out along the pier , to pass the time .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 18]: This pier runs down the side of the river , and a long way into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 31]: It had begun to grow dark , and Alec had to take great care of Kate amongst the tramways , coils of rope , and cables that crossed their way .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 45]: At length they got clear of these , and found themselves upon the pier , built of great rough stones -- lonely and desert , tapering away into the dark , its end invisible , but indicated by the red light far in front .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 21]: `` It is a rough season of the year for a lady to come by sea , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 13]: `` Bessie is very fond of the sea , '' answered Kate .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 12]: `` I hope you will like her , Mr Forbes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 13]: `` Do you want me to like her better than you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 3]: rejoined Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 27]: `` Because if you do -- '' `` Look how beautiful that red light is on the other side of the river , '' interrupted Kate .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 9]: `` And there is another further out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 43]: `` When the man at the helm gets those two lights in a line , '' said Alec , `` he may steer straight in , in the darkest night -- that is , if the tide serves for the bar . ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 16]: `` Look how much more glorious the red shine is on the water below ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 3]: said Kate .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 7]: `` It looks so wet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 10]: returned Alec , -- `` just like blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 26]: He almost cursed himself as he said so , for he felt Kate 's hand stir as if she would withdraw it from his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 21]: But after fluttering like a bird for a moment , it settled again upon its perch , and there rested .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 26]: The day had been quite calm , but now a sudden gust of wind from the north-east swept across the pier and made Kate shiver .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 15]: Alec drew her shawl closer about her , and her arm further within his .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 8]: They were now close to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 22]: On the other side of the wall which rose on their left , they could hear the first of the sea-waves .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 15]: It was a dreary place -- no sound even indicating the neighbourhood of life .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 87]: On one side , the river below them went flowing out to the sea in the dark , giving a cold sluggish gleam now and then , as if it were a huge snake heaving up a bend of its wet back , as it hurried away to join its fellows ; on the other side rose a great wall of stone , beyond which was the sound of long waves following in troops out of the dark , and falling upon a low moaning coast .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 16]: Clouds hung above the sea ; and above the clouds two or three disconsolate stars .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 10]: `` Here is a stair , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 28]: `` Let us go up on the top of the sea-wall , and then we shall catch the first glimpse of the light at her funnel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 23]: They climbed the steep rugged steps , and stood on the broad wall , hearing the sea-pulses lazily fall at its foot .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 18]: The wave crept away after it fell , and returned to fall again like a weary hound .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 9]: There was hardly any life in the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 31]: How mournful it was to lie out there , the wintry night , beneath an all but starless heaven , with the wind vexing it when it wanted to sleep !
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 20]: Alec feeling Kate draw a deep breath like the sigh of the sea , looked round in her face .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 16]: There was still light enough to show it frowning and dark and sorrowful and hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 22]: It was in fact a spiritual mirror , which reflected in human forms the look of that weary waste of waters .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 17]: She gave a little start , gathered herself together , and murmured something about the cold .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 11]: `` Let us go down again , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 18]: -- `` The wind has risen considerably , and the wall will shelter us down below . ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 14]: `` No , no , '' she answered ; `` I like it .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 8]: We can walk here just as well .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 8]: I do n't mind the wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 11]: `` I thought you were afraid of falling off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 8]: `` No , not in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 20]: I should be , I daresay , if I could see how far we are from the bottom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 5]: So they walked on .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 38]: The waves no longer fell at the foot of the wall , but leaned their breasts against it , gleaming as they rose on its front , and darkening as they sank low towards its deep base .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 22]: The wind kept coming in gusts , tearing a white gleam now and then on the dark surface of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 30]: Behind them shone the dim lights of the city ; before them all was dark as eternity , except for the one light at the end of the pier .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 9]: At length Alec spied another out at sea .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 12]: `` I believe that is the steamer , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 9]: `` But she is a good way off .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 23]: We shall have plenty of time to walk to the end -- that is , if you would like to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 8]: `` Certainly ; let us go on .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 13]: I want to stand on the very point , '' answered Kate .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 35]: They soon came to the lighthouse on the wall , and there descended to the lower part of the pier , the end of which now plunged with a steep descent into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 19]: It was constructed of great stones clamped with iron , and built into a natural foundation of rock .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 97]: Up the slope the waves rushed , and down the slope they sank again , with that seemingly aimless and resultless rise and fall , which makes the sea so dreary and sad to those men and women who are not satisfied without some goal in view , some outcome of their labours ; for it goes on and on , answering ever to the call of sun and moon , and the fierce trumpet of the winds , yet working nothing but the hopeless wear of the bosom in which it lies bound for ever .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 31]: They stood looking out into the great dark before them , dark air , dark sea , dark sky , watching the one light which grew brighter as they gazed .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 31]: Neither of them saw that a dusky figure was watching them from behind a great cylindrical stone that stood on the end of the pier , close to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 9]: A wave rushed up almost to their feet .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 13]: `` Let us go , '' said Kate , with a shiver .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 8]: `` I ca n't bear it longer .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 9]: The water is calling me and threatening me .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 14]: How that wave rushed up as if it wanted me at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 16]: Alec again drew her closer to him , and turning , they walked slowly back .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 33]: He was silent with the delight of having that lovely creature all to himself , leaning on his arm , in the infolding and protecting darkness , and Kate was likewise silent .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 49]: By the time they reached the quay at the other end of the pier , the steamer had crossed the bar , and they could hear the _ thud _ of her paddles treading the water beneath them , as if eagerly because she was near her rest .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 18]: After a few struggles , she lay quiet in her place , and they went on board .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 34]: Alec saw Kate embrace a girl perhaps a little older than herself , helped her to find her luggage , put them into a chaise , took his leave , and went home .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 20]: He did not know that all the way back along the pier they had been followed by Patrick Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIII .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 26]: Excited , and unable to settle to his work , Alec ran upstairs to Mr Cupples , whom he had not seen for some days .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 12]: He found him not more than half-way towards his diurnal goal .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 18]: `` What 's come o ' _ you _ , bantam , this mony a day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 4]: said Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 11]: `` I saw ye last Saturday , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 13]: `` Last Setterday week , ye mean , '' rejoined the librarian .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 10]: `` Hoo 's the mathematics comin ' on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 19]: `` To tell the truth , I 'm raither ahin ' wi ' them , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 8]: `` I was thinkin ' as muckle .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 2]: Rainbows !
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 3]: Thae rainbows !
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 5]: And the anawtomy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 13]: `` Nae jist stan ` in ' still a ` thegither . ''
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 5]: `` That 's weel .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 21]: Ye haena been fa'in ' asleep again ower the guddlet carcass o ' an auld pauper -- hae ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 3]: Alec stared .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 13]: He had never told any one of his adventure in the dissecting-room .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 8]: `` I saw ye , my man .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 10]: But I wasna the only ane that saw ye .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 43]: Ye micht hae gotten a waur fleg gin I hadna come up , for Mr Beauchamp was takin ' the bearin 's o ' ye throu the window , and whan I gaed up , he slippit awa ' like a wraith .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 35]: There ye lay , wi ' yer heid back , and yer mou ' open , as gin you and the deid man had been tryin ' whilk wad sleep the soun ` est. .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 11]: But ye hae ta'en to ither studies sin ' syne .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 11]: Ye hae a freah subject -- a bonnie young ane .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 8]: The Lord hae mercy upo ' ye !
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 29]: The goddess o ' the rainbow hersel 's gotten a haud o ' ye , and ye 'll be seein ' naething but rainbows for years to come .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 21]: -- Iris bigs bonnie brigs , but they hae nowther pier , nor buttress , nor key-stane , nor parapet .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 40]: And no fit can gang ower them but her ain , and whan she steps aff , it 's upo ' men 's herts , and yours can ill bide her fit , licht as it may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 12]: `` What are ye propheseein ' at , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 12]: said Alec , who did not more than half understand him .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 4]: `` Verra weel .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 13]: I 'm no drunk yet , '' rejoined Mr Cupples , oracularly .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 15]: `` But that chield Beauchamp 's no rainbow -- that lat me tell ye .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 17]: He 'll do you a mischeef yet , gin ye dinna luik a ' the shairper .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 8]: I ken the breed o ' him .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 14]: He was luikin ' at ye throu the window like a hungry deevil .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 39]: And jist min ' what ye 're aboot wi ' the lassie -- she 's rael bonnie -- or ye may chance to get her into trouble , withoot ony wyte -LRB- fault -RRB- o ' yer ain .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 8]: Min ' I 'm tellin ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 17]: Gin ye 'll tak my advice , ye 'll tak a dose o ' mathematics direckly .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 46]: It 's a fine alterative as weel as antidote , though maybe whusky 's ... the verra broo o ' the deevil 's ain pot , '' he concluded , altering his tone entirely , and swallowing the rest of his glass at a gulp .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 10]: `` What do ye want me to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 3]: asked Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 11]: `` To tak tent -LRB- care -RRB- o ' Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 21]: And meantime to rin doon for yer Euclid and yer Hutton , and lat 's see whaur ye are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 17]: There was more ground for Mr Cupples 's warning than Alec had the smallest idea of .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 52]: He had concluded long ago that all possible relations , even those of enmity -- practical enmity at least -- were over between them , and that Mr Beauchamp considered the bejan sufficiently punished for thrashing him , by being deprived of his condescending notice for the rest of the ages .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 55]: But so far was this from being the true state of the case , that , although Alec never suspected it , Beauchamp had in fact been dogging and haunting him from the very commencement of the session , and Mr Cupples had caught him in only one of many acts of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 39]: In the anatomical class , where they continued to meet , he still attempted to keep up the old look of diadain , as if the lesson he had received had in no way altered their relative position .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 30]: Had Alec known with what difficulty , and under what a load of galling recollection , he kept it up , he would have been heartily sorry for him .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 13]: Beauchamp 's whole consciousness was poisoned by the memory of that day .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 65]: Incapable of regarding any one except in comparative relation to himself , the effort of his life had been to maintain that feeling of superiority with which he started every new acquaintance ; for occasionally a flash of foreign individuality would break through the husk of satisfaction in which he had inclosed himself , compelling him to feel that another man might have claims .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 18]: And hitherto he had been very successful in patching up and keeping entire his eggshell of conceit .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 11]: But that affair with Alec was a very bad business .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 14]: Had Beauchamp been a coward , he would have suffered less from it .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 22]: But he was no coward , though not quite so courageous as Hector , who yet turned and fled before Achilles .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 29]: Without the upholding sense of duty , no man can be sure of his own behaviour , simply because he can not be sure of his own nerves .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 60]: Duty kept the red-cross knight `` forlorne and left to losse , '' `` haplesse and eke hopelesse , '' `` Disarmd , disgraste , and inwardly dismayde , And eke so faint in every joynt and vayne , '' from turning his back on the giant Orgoglio , and sent him pacing towards him with feeble steps instead .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 40]: But although he was not wanting in mere animal courage , Beauchamp 's pride always prevented him from engaging in any contest in which he was not sure of success , the thought of failure being to him unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 58]: When he found that he had miscalculated the probabilities , he was instantly dismayed ; and the blow he received on his mouth reminding his vanity of the danger his handsome face was in , he dropped his arms and declined further contest , comforting himself with the fancy of postponing his vengeance to a better opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 25]: But within an hour he knew that he had lost his chance , as certainly as he who omits the flood-tide of his fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 39]: He not only saw that he was disgraced , but felt in himself that he had been cowardly ; and , more mortifying still , felt that , with respect to the clodhopper , he was cowardly now .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 6]: He was afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 21]: Nor could he take refuge in the old satisfaction of despising him ; for that he found no longer possible .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 29]: He was on the contrary compelled to despise himself , an experience altogether new ; so that his contempt for Alec changed into a fierce , slow-burning hate .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 13]: Now hate keeps its object present even more than the opposite passion .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 14]: Love makes everything lovely ; hate concentrates itself on the one thing hated .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 24]: The very sound of Alec 's voice became to the ears of Beauchamp what a filthy potion would have been to his palate .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 20]: Every line of his countenance became to his eyes what a disgusting odour would have been to his nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 27]: And yet the fascination of his hate , and his desire of revenge , kept Beauchamp 's ears , eyes , and thoughts hovering about Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 27]: No way of gratifying his hatred , however , although he had been brooding over it all the previous summer , had presented itself till now .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 11]: Now he saw the possibility of working a dear revenge .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 13]: But even now , to work surely , he must delay long .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 7]: Still the present consolation was great .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 21]: Nor is it wonderful that his pride should not protect him from the deeper disgrace of walking in underground ways .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 17]: For there is nothing in the worship of self to teach a man to be noble .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 14]: Honour even will one day fail him who has learned no higher principle .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 29]: And although revenge be `` a kind of wild justice , '' it loses the justice , and retains only the wildness , when it corrupts into hatred .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 20]: Every feeling that Beauchamp had was swallowed up in the gulf eaten away by that worst of all canker-worms .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 36]: Notwithstanding the humiliation he had experienced , he retained as yet an unlimited confidence in some gifts which he supposed himself to possess by nature , and to be capable of using with unequalled art .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 15]: And true hate , as well as true love , knows how to wait .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIV .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 44]: In the course of her study of Milton , Annie had come upon Samson 's lamentation over his blindness ; and had found , soon after , the passage in which Milton , in his own person , bewails the loss of light .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 15]: The thought that she would read them to Tibbie Dyster was a natural one .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 35]: She borrowed the volumes from Mrs Forbes ; and , the next evening , made her way to Tibbie 's cottage , where she was welcomed as usual by her gruff voice of gratefulness .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 25]: `` Ye 're a gude bairn to come a ' this gait through the snaw to see an auld blin ' body like me .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 19]: It 's dingin ' on -LRB- snowing or raining -RRB- -- is na ` t , bairn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 13]: `` Ay is ` t. Hoo do ye ken , Tibbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 8]: `` I dinna ken hoo I ken .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 5]: I was na sure .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 10]: The snaw maks unco little din , ye see .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 14]: It comes doon like the speerit himsel ' upo ' quaiet herts . ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 9]: `` Did ye ever see , Tibbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 7]: asked Annie , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 11]: `` Na ; nae that I min ' upo ' .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 39]: I was but twa year auld , my mither used to tell fowk , whan I had the pock , an ' it jist closed up my een for ever -- i ' this warl , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 17]: I s ' see some day as weel 's ony o ' ye , lass . ''
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 11]: `` Do ye ken what licht is , Tibbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 19]: said Annie , whom Milton had set meditating on Tibbie 's physical in relation to her mental condition .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 20]: `` Ay , weel eneuch , '' answered Tibbie , with a touch of indignation at the imputed ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 5]: `` What for no ?
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 6]: What gars ye spier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 7]: I jist wanted to ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 7]: `` Hoo could I no ken ?
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 16]: Disna the Saviour say : ' I am the licht o ' the warl ? '
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 14]: -- He that walketh in Him maun ken what licht is , lassie .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 22]: Syne ye hae the licht in yersel -- in yer ain hert ; an ' ye maun ken what it is .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 7]: Ye canna mistak ' it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 21]: Annie was neither able nor willing to enter into an argument on the matter , although she was not satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 9]: She would rather think than dispute about it .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 9]: So she changed the subject in a measure .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 13]: `` Did ye ever hear o ' John Milton , Tibbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 2]: ay .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 12]: He was blin ' like mysel , ' wasna he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 6]: `` Ay , was he .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 13]: I hae been readin ' a heap o ' his poetry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 56]: I wad richt weel like to hear a bittie o ' ` t. '' `` Weel , here 's a bit ` at he made as gin Samson was sayin ' o ' ` t , till himsel ' like , efter they had pitten oot 's een -- the Phillisteens , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 8]: `` Ay , I ken weel eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 4]: Read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 6]: Annie read the well-known passage .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 30]: Tibbie listened to the end , without word of remark or question , her face turned towards the reader , and her sightless balls rolling under their closed lids .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 17]: When Annie 's voice ceased , she said , after a little reflection : `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 9]: It 's bonnie , an ' verra true .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 5]: And , puir man !
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 35]: it was waur for him nor for me and Milton ; for it was a ' his ain wyte ; and it was no to be expecket he cud be sae quaiet as anither .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 14]: But he had no richt to queston the ways o ' the Maker .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 9]: But it 's bonnie , rael bonnie . ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 19]: `` Noo , I 'll jist read to ye what Milton says aboot his ain blin ` ness .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 10]: But it 's some ill to unnerstan ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 14]: `` Maybe I 'll unnerstan ' ' t better nor you , bairn .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 5]: Read awa ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 6]: So admonished , Annie read .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 7]: Tibbie fidgeted about on her seat .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 8]: It was impossible either should understand it .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 11]: And the proper names were a great puzzle to them .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 5]: `` Tammy Riss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 13]: said Tibbie ; `` I ken naething aboot _ him _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 27]: `` Na , neither do I , '' said Annie ; and beginning the line again , she blundered over '' _ blind Maeonides _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 11]: `` Ye 're readin ' ' t wrang , bairn .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 24]: It sud be ' _ nae ony days _ , ' for there 's nae days or nichts either to the blin ' .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 10]: They dinna ken the differ , ye see . ''
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 17]: `` I 'm readin ' ' t as I hae ` t , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 26]: `` It 's a muckle M. '' `` I ken naething aboot yer muckle or yer little Ms , '' retorted Tibbie , with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 13]: `` Gin that binna what it means , it 's ayont me .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 4]: Read awa ' .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 9]: Maybe we 'll come to something better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 6]: `` Ay will we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 6]: said Annie , and resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 50]: With the words , '' _ Thus with the year seasons return _ , '' Tibbie 's attention grew fixed ; and when the reader came to the passage , `` So much the rather thou , Celestial Light , Shine inward , '' her attention rose into rapture .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 7]: `` Ay , ay , lassie !
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 8]: That man kent a ' aboot it !
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 18]: He wad never hae speired gin a blin ' crater like me kent what the licht was .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 7]: He kent what it was weel .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 5]: Ay did he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 24]: `` But , ye see , he was a gey auld man afore he tint his eesicht , '' Annie ventured to interpose .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 6]: `` Sae muckle the better !
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 5]: He kent baith kinds .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 19]: And he kent that the sicht without the een is better nor the sicht o ' the een .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 48]: Fowk nae doobt has baith ; but I think whiles ` at the Lord gies a grainy mair o ' the inside licht to mak ' up for the loss o ' the ootside ; and weel I wat it doesna want muckle to do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 20]: `` But ye dinna ken what it is , '' objected Annie , with unnecessary persistency in the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 9]: `` Do ye tell me that again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 5]: returned Tibbie , harshly .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 8]: `` Ye 'll anger me , bairn .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 84]: Gin ye kent hoo I lie awauk at nicht , no able to sleep for thinkin ' ` at the day _ will _ come whan I 'll see -- wi ' my ain open een -- the verra face o ' him that bore oor griefs an ' carried oor sorrows , till I jist lie and greit , for verra wissin ' , ye wadna say ` at I dinna ken what the sicht o ' a body 's een is .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 7]: Sae nae mair o ' that !
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 46]: I beg o ' ye , or I 'll jist need to gang to my prayers to haud me ohn been angry wi ' ane o ' the Lord 's bairns ; for that ye _ are _ , I do believe , Annie Anderson .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 43]: Ye canna ken what blin ` ness is ; but I doobt ye ken what the licht is , lassie ; and , for the lave -LRB- rest -RRB- , jist ye lippen -LRB- trust -RRB- to John Milton and me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 7]: Annie dared not say another word .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 7]: She sat silent -- perhaps rebuked .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 41]: But Tibbie resumed : `` Ye maunna think , hooever , 'cause sic longin ' thouchts come ower me , that I gang aboot the hoose girnin ' and compleenin ' that I canna open the door and win oot .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 4]: Na , na .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 45]: I could jist despise the licht , whiles , that ye mak ' sic a wark aboot , and sing and shout , as the Psalmist says ; for I 'm jist that glaid , that I dinna ken hoo to haud it in .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 8]: For the Lord 's my frien ' .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 16]: I can jist tell him a ' that comes into my puir blin ' heid .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 16]: Ye see there 's ither ways for things to come intil a body 's heid .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 8]: There 's mair doors nor the een .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 24]: There 's back doors , whiles , that lat ye oot to the bonnie gairden , and that 's better nor the road-side .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 18]: And the smell o ' the braw flooers comes in at the back winnocks , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 19]: -- Whilk o ' the bonnie flooers do ye think likest _ Him _ , Annie Anderson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 6]: I dinna ken , Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 13]: I 'm thinkin ' they maun be a ' like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 8]: `` Ay , ay , nae doobt .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 13]: But some o ' them may be liker him nor ithers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 15]: `` Weel , whilk do _ ye _ think likest him , Tibbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 20]: `` I think it maun be the minnonette -- sae clean and sae fine and sae weel content . ''
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 12]: `` Ay , ye 're speiken by the smell , Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 11]: But gin ye saw the rose -- '' `` Hoots !
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 9]: I hae seen the rose mony a time .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 46]: Nae doobt it 's bonnier to luik at -- '' and here her fingers went moving about as if they were feeling the full-blown sphere of a rose -- `` but I think , for my pairt , that the minnonette 's likest Him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 16]: `` May be , '' was all Annie 's reply , and Tibbie went on .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 10]: `` There maun be faces liker him nor ithers .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 21]: Come here , Annie , and lat me fin -LRB- feel -RRB- whether ye be like him or no . ''
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 7]: `` Hoo can ye ken that ?
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 7]: -- ye never saw him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 5]: `` Never saw him !
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 9]: I hae seen him ower and ower again .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 7]: I see him whan I like .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 7]: Come here , I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 28]: Annie went and knelt down beside her , and the blind woman passed her questioning fingers in solemn silence over and over the features of the child .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 18]: At length , with her hands still resting upon Annie 's head , she uttered her judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 3]: `` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 7]: Some like him , nae doot .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 17]: But she 'll be a heap liker him whan she sees him as he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 59]: When a Christian proceeds to determine the rightness of his neighbour by his approximation to his fluctuating ideal , it were well if the judgment were tempered by such love as guided the hands of blind Tibbie over the face of Annie in their attempt to discover whether or not she was like the Christ of her visions .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 14]: `` Do ye think _ ye _ 're like him , Tibbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 15]: said Annie with a smile , which Tibbie at once detected in the tone .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 5]: `` Hoots , bairn !
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 11]: I had the pock dreidfu ' , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 25]: `` Weel , maybe we a ' hae had something or ither that hauds us ohn been sae bonny as we micht hae been .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 19]: For ae thing , there 's the guilt o ' Adam 's first sin , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 6]: `` Verra richt , bairn .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 28]: Nae doot that 's blaudit mony a face -- ` the want o ' original richteousness , and the corruption o ' our whole natur ' . '
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 12]: The wonner is that we 're like him at a ' .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 19]: But we maun be like him , for he was a man born o ' a wumman . '
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 8]: Think o ' that , lass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 17]: At this moment the latch of the door was lifted , and in walked Robert Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 41]: He gave a stare when he saw Annie , for he had thought her out of the way at Howglen , and said in a tone of asperity , `` Ye 're a ' gait at ance , Annie Anderson .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 5]: A doonricht rintheroot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 13]: `` Lat the bairn be , Maister Bruce , '' said Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 18]: `` She 's doin ' the Lord 's will , whether ye may think it or no .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 17]: She 's visitin ' them ` at 's i ' the prison-hoose o ' the dark .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 21]: She 's ministerin ' to them ` at hae mony preeviledges nae doot , but hae room for mair . ''
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 11]: `` I 'm no saying naething , '' said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 6]: `` Ye are sayin ' .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 11]: Ye 're offendin ' ane o ' his little anes .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 9]: Tak ye tent o ' the millstane . ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 4]: `` Hoot toot !
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 2]: Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 34]: I was only wissin ` at she wad keep a sma ' part o ' her ministrations for her ain hame and her ain fowk ` at has the ministerin ' to her .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 12]: There 's the mistress and me jist mairtyrs to that chop !
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 40]: And there 's the bit infant in want o ' some _ ministration _ noo and than , gin that be what ye ca ' ` t. '' A grim compression of the mouth was all Tibbie 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 48]: She did not choose to tell Robert Bruce that although she was blind -- and probably _ because _ she was blind -- she heard rather more gossip than anybody else in Glamerton , and that consequently his appeal to her sympathy had no effect upon her .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 12]: Finding she made no other answer , Bruce turned to Annie .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 18]: `` Noo , Annie , '' said he , `` ye 're nae wantit here ony langer .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 11]: I hae a word or twa to say to Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 11]: Gang hame and learn yer lessons for the morn . ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 10]: `` It 's Setterday nicht , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 13]: `` But ye hae yer lessons to learn for the Mononday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 4]: `` Ow ay !
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 15]: But I hae a buik or twa to tak ' hame to Mistress Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 22]: And I daursay I 'll bide , and come to the kirk wi ' her i ' the mornin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 39]: Now , although all that Bruce wanted was to get rid of her , he went on to oppose her ; for common-minded people always feel that they give the enemy an advantage if they show themselves content .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 16]: `` It 's no safe to rin aboot i ' the mirk -LRB- dark -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 7]: It 's dingin ' on forbye .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 15]: Ye 'll be a ' wat , and maybe fa ' into the dam .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 18]: Ye couldna see yer han ' afore yer face -- ance oot o ' the toon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 22]: `` I ken the road to Mistress Forbes 's as weel 's the road up your garret-stairs , Mr Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 6]: `` Ow nae doobt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 29]: he answered , with a sneering acerbity peculiar to him , in which his voice seemed sharpened and concentrated to a point by the contraction of his lips .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 18]: `` And there 's tykes aboot , '' he added , remembering Annie 's fear of dogs .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 17]: But by this time Annie , gentle as she was , had got a little angry .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 30]: `` The Lord 'll tak care o ' me frae the dark and the tykes , and the lave o ' ye , Mr Bruce , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 39]: And bidding Tibbie good-night , she took up her books , and departed , to wade through the dark and the snow , trembling lest some unseen _ tyke _ should lay hold of her as she went .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 27]: As soon as she was gone , Bruce proceeded to make himself agreeable to Tibbie by retailing all the bits of gossip he could think of .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 30]: While thus engaged , he kept peering earnestly about the room from door to chimney , turning his head on every side , and surveying as he turned it .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 20]: Even Tibbie perceived , from the changes in the sound of his voice , that he was thus occupied .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 11]: `` Sae your auld landlord 's deid , Tibbie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 5]: he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 6]: `` Ay , honest man !
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 13]: He had aye a kin ' word for a poor body . ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 8]: `` Ay , ay , nae doobt .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 28]: But what wad ye say gin I tell ' t ye that I had boucht the bit hoosie , and was yer new landlord , Tibbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 33]: `` I wad say that the door-sill wants men ` in ' , to haud the snaw oot ; an ' the bit hoosie 's sair in want o ' new thack .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 12]: The verra cupples 'll be rottit awa ' or lang . ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 19]: `` Weel that 's verra rizzonable , nae doobt , gin a ' be as ye say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 10]: `` Be as I say , Robert Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 17]: `` Ay , ay ; ye see ye 're nae a ` thegither like ither fowk .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 22]: I dinna mean ony offence , ye ken , Tibbie ; but ye haena the sicht o ' yer een . ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 18]: `` Maybe I haena the feelin ' o ' my auld banes , aither , Maister Bruce !
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 41]: Maybe I 'm ower blin ' to hae the rheumatize ; or to smell the auld weet thack whan there 's been a scatterin ' o ' snaw or a drappy o ' rain o ' the riggin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 10]: `` I didna want to anger ye , Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 8]: A ' that ye say deserves attention .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 29]: It would be a shame to lat an auld body like you -- '' `` No that auld , Maister Bruce , gin ye kent the trowth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 24]: `` Weel , ye 're no ower young to need to be ta'en guid care o ' -- are ye , Tibbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 3]: Tibbie grunted .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 9]: `` Weel , to come to the pint .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 16]: There 's nae doobt the hoose wants a hantle o ' doctorin ' . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 10]: ` Deed does ` t , '' interposed Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 8]: `` It 'll want a new door .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 25]: For forbye ` at the door 's maist as wide as twa ordinar doors , it was ance in twa halves like a chop-door .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 25]: And they 're ill jined thegither , and the win ' comes throu like a knife , and maist cuts a body in twa .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 23]: Ye see the bit hoosie was ance the dyer 's dryin ' hoose , afore he gaed further doon the watter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 9]: `` Nae doobt ye 're richt , Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 25]: But seein ' that I maun lay oot sae muckle , I 'll be compelled to pit anither thrippence on to the rent . ''
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 7]: `` Ither thrippence , Robert Bruce !
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 14]: That 's three thrippences i ' the ook in place o ' twa .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 6]: That 's an unco rise !
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 7]: Ye canna mean what ye say !
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 15]: It 's a ' that I 'm able to do to pay my saxpence .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 38]: An auld blin ' body like me disna fa ' in wi ' saxpences whan she gangs luikin aboot wi ' her lang fingers for a pirn or a prin that she 's looten fa ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 19]: `` But ye do a heap o ' spinnin ' , Tibbie , wi ' thae lang fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 10]: There 's naebody in Glamerton spins like ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 7]: `` Maybe ay and maybe no .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 9]: It 's no muckle that that comes till .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 32]: I wadna spin sae weel gin it warna that the Almichty pat some sicht into the pints o ' my fingers , 'cause there was nane left i ' my een .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 47]: An ' gin ye mak ither thrippence a week oot o ' that , ye 'll be turnin ' the wather that He sent to ca my mill into your dam ; an ' I doot it 'll play ill water wi ' your wheels . ''
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 5]: `` Hoot , hoot !
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 4]: Tibbie , woman !
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 12]: It gangs sair against me to appear to be hard-hertit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 6]: `` I hae nae doobt .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 9]: Ye dinna want to _ appear _ sae .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 38]: But do ye ken that I mak sae little by the spinnin ' ye mak sae muckle o ' , that the kirk alloos me a shillin ' i ' the week to mak up wi ' ?
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 24]: And gin it warna for kin ' frien 's , it 's ill livin ' I wad hae in dour weather like this .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 17]: Dinna ye imaigine , Mr Bruce , that I hae a pose o ' my ain .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 15]: I hae naething ava , excep ' sevenpence in a stockin ' - fit .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 22]: And it wad hae to come aff o ' my tay or something ither ` at I wad ill miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 28]: `` Weel , that may be a ' verra true , '' rejoined Bruce ; `` but a body maun hae their ain for a ' that .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 10]: Wadna the kirk gie ye the ither thrippence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 17]: `` Do ye think I wad tak frae the kirk to pit into your till ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 15]: `` Weel , say saivenpence , than , and we 'll be quits . ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 38]: `` I tell ye what , Robert Bruce : raither nor pay ye one bawbee more nor the saxpence , I 'll turn oot i ' the snaw , and lat the Lord luik efter me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 61]: Robert Bruce went away , and did not purchase the cottage , which was in the market at a low price , He had intended Tibbie to believe , as she did , that he had already bought it ; and if she had agreed to pay even the sevenpence , he would have gone from her to secure it .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 46]: On her way to Howglen , Annie pondered on the delight of Tibbie -- Tibbie Dyster who had never seen the `` human face divine '' -- when she should see the face of Jesus Christ , most likely the first face she would see .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 16]: Then she turned to what Tibbie had said about knowing light from knowing the Saviour .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 20]: There must be some connection between what Tibbie said and what Thomas had said about the face of God .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 21]: There was a text that said `` God is light , and in him is no darkness at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 25]: So she was sure that the light that was in a Christian , whatever it meant , must come from the face of God .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 20]: And so what Thomas said and what Tibbie said might be only different ways of saying the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 43]: Thus she was in a measure saved from the perplexity which comes of any _ one _ definition of the holy secret , compelling a man to walk in a way between walls , instead of in a path across open fields .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 46]: There was no day yet in which Annie did not think of her old champion with the same feeling of devotion which his championship had first aroused , although all her necessities , hopes , and fears were now beyond any assistance he could render .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 50]: She was far on in a new path : he was loitering behind , out of hearing , He would not have dared to call her solicitude nonsense ; but he would have set down all such matters as belonging to women , rather than youths beginning the world .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 16]: The lessons of Thomas Crann were not despised , for he never thought about them .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 20]: He began to look down upon all his past , and , in it , upon his old companions .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 51]: Since knowing Kate , who had more delicate habits and ways than he had ever seen , he had begun to refine his own modes concerning outside things ; and in his anxiety to be like her , while he became more polished , he became less genial and wide-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 9]: But none of his old friends forgot him .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 50]: I believe not a day passed in which Thomas did not pray for him in secret , naming him by his name , and lingering over it mournfully -- `` Alexander Forbes -- the young man that I thocht wad hae been pluckit frae the burnin ' afore noo .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 10]: But thy time 's the best , O Lord .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 17]: It 's a ' thy wark ; an ' there 's no good thing in us .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 16]: And thou canst turn the hert o ' man as the rivers o ' water .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 19]: And maybe thou hast gi'en him grace to repent already , though I ken naething aboot it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLV .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 19]: This had been a sore winter for Thomas , and he had had plenty of leisure for prayer .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 61]: For , having gone up on a scaffold one day to see that the wall he was building was properly protected from the rain , he slipped his foot on a wet pole , and fell to the ground , whence , being a heavy man , he was lifted terribly shaken , besides having one of his legs broken .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 14]: Not a moan escaped him -- a murmur was out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 14]: They carried him home , and the surgeon did his best for him .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 17]: Nor , although few people liked him much , was he left unvisited in his sickness .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 30]: The members of his own religious community recognized their obligation to minister to him ; and they would have done more , had they guessed how poor he was .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 36]: Nobody knew how much he gave away in other directions ; but they judged of his means by the amount he was in the habit of putting into the plate at the chapel-door every Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 36]: There was never much of the silvery shine to be seen in the heap of copper , but one of the gleaming sixpences was almost sure to have dropped from the hand of Thomas Crann .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 58]: Not that this generosity sprung altogether from disinterested motives ; for the fact was , that he had a morbid fear of avarice ; a fear I believe not altogether groundless ; for he was independent in his feelings almost to fierceness -- certainly to ungraciousness ; and this strengthened a natural tendency to saving and hoarding .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 12]: The consciousness of this tendency drove him to the other extreme .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 99]: Jean , having overheard him once cry out in an agony , `` Lord , hae mercy upo ' me , and deliver me frae this love o ' money , which is the root of all evil , '' watched him in the lobby of the chapel the next Sunday -- `` and as sure 's deith , '' said Jean -- an expression which it was weel for her that Thomas did not hear -- `` he pat a siller shillin ' into the plate that day , mornin ' _ an ' _ nicht . ''
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 66]: `` Tak ' care hoo ye affront him , whan ye tak ' it , '' said Andrew Constable to his wife , who was setting out to carry him some dish of her own cooking -- for Andrew 's wife belonged to the missionars -- `` for weel ye ken Thamas likes to be unner obligation to nane but the Lord himsel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 13]: `` Lea ' ye that to me , Anerew , my man .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 18]: You ` at 's rouch men disna ken hoo to do a thing o ' that sort .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 8]: I s ' manage Thamas weel eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 9]: I ken the nater o ' him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 20]: And sure enough he ate it up at once , that she might take the dish back with her .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 37]: Annie went every day to ask after him , and every day had a kind reception from Jean , who bore her no grudge for the ignominious treatment of Thomas on that evening memorable to Annie .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 22]: At length , one day , after many weeks , Jean asked her if she would not like to see him .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 12]: `` Ay wad I ; richt weel , '' answered she .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 20]: Jean led her at once into Thomas 's room , where he lay in a bed in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 6]: He held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 29]: Annie could hardly be said to take it , but she put hers into it , saying timidly , `` Is yer leg verra sair , Thamas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 9]: `` Ow na , dawtie ; nae noo .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 14]: The Lord 's been verra mercifu ' -- jist like himsel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 13]: It was ill to bide for a while whan I cudna sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 13]: But I jist sleep noo like ane o ' the beloved . ''
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 11]: `` I was richt sorry for ye , Thamas . ''
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 12]: `` Ay , Ye 've a kin ' hert , lassie .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 30]: And I canna help thinkin ' -- they may say what they like -- but I canna help thinkin ' that the Lord was sorry for me himsel ' .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 33]: It cam ' into my heid as I lay here ae nicht , an ' cudna sleep a wink , and cudna rist , and yet daurna muv for my broken hough .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 41]: And as sune 's that cam ' into my heid I was sae upliftit , ` at I forgot a ' aboot my leg , and begud , or ever I kent , to sing the hunner and saivent psalm .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 50]: And syne whan the pain cam ' back wi ' a terrible stoon , I jist amaist leuch ; an I thoucht that gin he wad brack me a ' to bits , I wad never cry _ haud _ , nor turn my finger to gar him stent .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 16]: Noo , ye 're ane o ' the Lord 's bairns -- '' `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 30]: I dinna ken , '' cried Annie , half-terrified at such an assurance from Thomas , and the responsibility devolved on her thereby , and yet delighted beyond expression .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 22]: `` Ay are ye , '' continued Thomas confidently ; `` and I want to ken what ye think aboot it .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 15]: Do ye think it was a wrang thocht to come into my heid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 35]: `` Hoo could that be , Thomas , whan it set ye a singin ' -- and sic a psalm -- ' O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 9]: `` The Lord be praised ance mair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 4]: exclaimed Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 14]: ` Oot o ' the mooth o ' babes and sucklin 's ! '
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 17]: -- no that ye 're jist that , Annie , but ye 're no muckle mair .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 22]: Sit ye doon aside me , and rax ower to the Bible , and jist read that hunner and saivent psalm .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 4]: Eh , lassie !
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 6]: but the Lord is guid .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 6]: that men wad praise him !
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 14]: An ' to care for the praises o ' sic worms as me !
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 9]: What richt hae I to praise him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 17]: `` Ye hae the best richt , Thomas , for hasna he been good to ye ?
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 14]: -LSB- '' -RSB- `` Ye 're richt , lassie , ye 're richt .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 11]: It 's wonnerfu ' the common sense o ' bairns .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 10]: Gin ye wad jist lat the Lord instruck them !
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 10]: I doobt we mak ower little o ' them .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 32]: Nae doobt they 're born in sin , and brocht farth in iniquity ; but gin they repent ear ' , they win far aheid o ' the auld fowk . ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 17]: Thomas 's sufferings had made him more gentle -- and more sure of Annie 's election .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 11]: He was one on whom affliction was not thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 92]: -- Annie saw him often after this , and he never let her go without reading a chapter to him , his remarks upon which were always of some use to her , notwithstanding the limited capacity and formal shape of the doctrinal moulds in which they were cast ; for wherever there is genuine religious feeling and _ experience _ , it will now and then crack the prisoning pitcher , and let some brilliant ray of the indwelling glory out , to discomfit the beleaguering hosts of troublous thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 28]: Although the framework of Thomas was roughly hewn , he had always been subject to such fluctuations of feeling as are more commonly found amongst religious women .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 62]: Sometimes , notwithstanding the visions of the face of God `` vouchsafed to him from the mercy-seat , '' as he would say , he would fall into fits of doubting whether he was indeed one of the elect ; for how then could he be so hard-hearted , and so barren of good thoughts and feelings as he found himself ?
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 41]: At such times he was subject to an irritation of temper , alternately the cause and effect of his misery , upon which , with all his efforts , he was only capable yet of putting a very partial check .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 13]: Woe to the person who should then dare to interrupt his devotions !
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 88]: If Jean , who had no foresight or anticipation of consequences , should , urged by some supposed necessity of the case , call to him through the door bolted against Time and its concerns , the saint who had been kneeling before God in utter abasement , self-contempt , and wretchedness , would suddenly wrench it open , a wrathful , indignant man , boiling brimful of angry words and unkind objurgations , through all which would be manifest , notwithstanding , a certain unhappy restraint .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 47]: Having driven the enemy away in confusion , he would bolt his door again , and return to his prayers in two-fold misery , conscious of guilt increased by unrighteous anger , and so of yet another wall of separation raised between him and his God .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 38]: Now this weakness all but disappeared during the worst of his illness , to return for a season with increased force when his recovery had advanced so far as to admit of his getting out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 34]: Children are almost always cross when recovering from an illness , however patient they may have been during its severest moments ; and the phenomenon is not by any means confined to children .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 38]: A deacon of the church , a worthy little weaver , had been half-officially appointed to visit Thomas , and find out , which was not an easy task , if he was in want of anything .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 8]: When he arrived , Jean was out .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 24]: He lifted the latch , entered , and tapped gently at Thomas 's door -- too gently , for he received no answer .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 14]: With hasty yet hesitating imprudence , he opened the door and peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 16]: Thomas was upon his knees by the fire-side , with his plaid over his head .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 34]: Startled by the weaver 's entrance , he raised his head , and his rugged leonine face , red with wrath , glared out of the thicket of his plaid upon the intruder .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 17]: He did not rise , for that would have been a task requiring time and caution .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 52]: But he cried aloud in a hoarse voice , with his two hands leaning on the chair , like the paws of some fierce rampant animal : `` Jeames , ye 're takin ' the pairt o ' Sawton upo ' ye , drivin ' a man frae his prayers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 5]: `` Hoot , Thamas !
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 23]: I beg yer pardon , '' answered the weaver , rather flurried ; `` I thoucht ye micht hae been asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 15]: `` Ye had no business to think for yersel ' in sic a maitter .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 6]: What do ye want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 21]: `` I jist cam ' to see whether _ ye _ war in want o ' onything , Thamas . ''
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 9]: `` I 'm in want o ' naething .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 6]: Gude nicht to ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 46]: `` But , railly , Thamas , '' expostulated the weaver , emboldened by his own kindness -- `` ye 'll excuse me , but ye hae nae business to gang doon on yer knees wi ' yer leg in sic a weyk condeetion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 8]: `` I winna excuse ye , Jeames .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 7]: What ken ye aboot my leg ?
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 16]: And what 's the use o ' knees , but to gang doon upo ' ?
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 27]: Gang hame , and gang doon upo ' yer ain , Jeames ; and dinna disturb ither fowk that ken what theirs was made for . ''
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 9]: Thus admonished , the weaver dared not linger .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 20]: As he turned to shut the door , he wished the mason good night , but received no answer .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 18]: Thomas had sunk forward upon the chair , and had already drawn his plaid over his head .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 25]: But the secret place of the Most High will not be entered after this fashion ; and Thomas felt that he was shut out .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 16]: It is not by driving away our brother that we can be alone with God .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 19]: Thomas 's plaid could not isolate him with his Maker , for communion with God is never isolation .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 30]: In such a mood , the chamber with the shut door shuts out God too , and one is left alone with himself , which is the outer darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 18]: The love of the brethren opens the door into God 's chamber , which is within ours .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 77]: So Thomas -- who was far enough from hating his brother , who would have struggled to his feet and limped to do him a service , though he would not have held out his hand to receive one , for he was only good , not gracious -- Thomas , I say , felt worse than ever , and more as if God had forgotten him , than he had felt for many a day .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 7]: He knelt still and sighed sore .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 18]: At length another knock came , which although very gentle , he heard and knew well enough .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 6]: `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 13]: he asked , notwithstanding , with a fresh access of indignant feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 27]: `` Annie Anderson , '' was the answer through the door , in a tone which at once soothed the ruffled waters of Thomas 's spirit .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 8]: `` Come in , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 8]: She entered , quiet as a ghost .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 7]: `` Come awa ' , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 7]: I 'm glaid to see ye .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 25]: Jist come and kneel doon aside me , and we 'll pray thegither , for I 'm sair troubled wi ' an ill-temper . ''
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 15]: Without a word of reply , Annie kneeled by the side of his chair .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 153]: Thomas drew the plaid over her head , took her hand , which was swallowed up in his , and after a solemn pause , spoke thus : `` O Lord , wha dwellest in the licht inaccessible , whom mortal eye hath not seen nor can see , but who dwellest with him that is humble and contrite of heart , and liftest the licht o ' thy coontenance upo ' them that seek it , O Lord , '' -- here the solemnity of the appeal gave way before the out-bursting agony of Thomas 's heart -- `` O Lord , dinna lat 's cry in vain , this thy lammie , and me , thine auld sinner , but , for the sake o ' him wha did no sin , forgive my sins and my vile temper , and help me to love my neighbour as mysel ' .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 18]: Lat Christ dwell in me and syne I shall be meek and lowly of heart like him .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 37]: Put thy speerit in me , and syne I shall do richt -- no frae mysel ' , for I hae no good thing in me , but frae thy speerit that dwelleth in us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 10]: After this prayer , Thomas felt refreshed and hopeful .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 26]: With slow labour he rose from his knees at last , and sinking into his chair , drew Annie towards him , and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 18]: Then he said , `` Will ye gang a bit eeran ' for me , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 7]: `` That I will , Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 14]: I wad rin mysel ' aff o ' my legs for ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 5]: `` Na , na .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 10]: I dinna want sae muckle rinnin ' the nicht .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 95]: But I wad be sair obleeged to ye gin ye wad jist rin doon to Jeames Johnstone , the weyver , and tell him , wi ' my coampliments , ye ken , that I 'm verra sorry I spak ' till him as I did the nicht ; and I wad tak it richt kin ' o ' him gin he wad come and tak a cup o ' tay wi ' me the morn 's nicht , and we cud hae a crack thegither , and syne we cud hae worship thegither .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 37]: And tell him he maunna think nae mair o ' the way I spak ' till him , for I was troubled i ' my min ' , and I 'm an ill-nater 'd man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 59]: `` I 'll tell him a ' that ye say , '' answered Annie , `` as weel 's I can min ' ` t ; and I s ' warran ' I s ' no forget muckle o ' ` t. Wad ye like me to come back the nicht and tell ye what he says ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 7]: `` Na , na , lassie .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 14]: It 'll be nearhan ' time for ye to gang to yer bed .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 7]: And it 's a cauld nicht .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 7]: I ken that by my leg .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 14]: And ye see Jeames Johnstone 's no an ill-nater 'd man like me .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 19]: He 's a douce man , and he 's sure to be weel-pleased and come till 's tay .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 9]: Na , na ; ye needna come back .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 8]: Guid nicht to ye , my dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 17]: The Lord bless ye for comin ' to pray wi ' an ill-nater 'd man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 32]: Annie sped upon her mission of love through the murky streets and lanes of Glamerton , as certainly a divine messenger as any seraph crossing the blue empyrean upon level wing .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 103]: And if any one should take exception to this , on the ground that she sought her own service and neglected home duties , I would , although my object has not been to set her forth as an exemplar , take the opportunity of asking whether to sleep in a certain house and be at liberty to take one 's meals there , be sufficient to make it home , and the source of home-obligations -- to indicate the will of God as to _ the _ region of one 's labour , other regions lying open at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 51]: Ought Annie to have given her aid as a child where there was no parental recognition of the relationship -- an aid whose value in the eyes of the Bruces would have consisted in the leisure it gave to Mrs Bruce for ministering more devotedly in the temple of Mammon ?
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 15]: I put the question , not quite sure what the answer ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVI .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 14]: Now that Kate had got a companion , Alec never saw her alone .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 12]: But he had so much the better opportunity of knowing her .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 49]: Miss Warner was a nice , open-eyed , fair-faced English girl , with pleasant manners , and plenty of speech ; and although more shy than Kate -- English girls being generally more shy than Scotch girls -- was yet ready enough to take her share in conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 19]: Between the two , Alec soon learned how ignorant he was in the things that most interest girls .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 18]: Classics and mathematics were not _ very _ interesting to himself , and anatomy was not available .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 58]: He soon perceived that they were both fond of poetry ; but if it was not the best poetry , he was incapable of telling them so , although the few lessons he had had were from a better mistress than either of them , and with some better examples than they had learned to rejoice in .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 30]: The two girls had got hold of some volumes of Byron , and had read them together at school , chiefly after retiring to the chamber they shared together .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 19]: The consequences were an unbounded admiration and a facility of reference , with the use of emotional adjectives .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 26]: Alec did not know a single poem of that writer , except the one about the Assyrian coming down like a wolf on the fold .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 38]: Determined , however , not to remain incapable of sympathizing with them , he got copies of the various poems from the library of the college , and for days studied Byron and anatomy -- nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 16]: Like all other young men , he was absorbed , entranced , with the poems .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 17]: Childe Harold he could not read , but the tales were one fairy region after another .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 74]: Their power over young people is remarkable , but not more remarkable than the fact that they almost invariably lose this power over the individual , while they have as yet retained it over the race ; for of all the multitude which does homage at the shrine of the poet few linger long , and fewer still , after the turmoil of life has yielded room for thought , renew their homage .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 27]: Most of those who make the attempt are surprised -- some of them troubled -- at the discovery that the shrine can work miracles no more .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 28]: The Byron-fever is in fact a disease belonging to youth , as the hooping-cough to childhood , -- working some occult good no doubt in the end .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 52]: It has its origin , perhaps , in the fact that the poet makes no demand either on the intellect or the conscience , but confines himself to friendly intercourse with those passions whose birth long precedes that of choice in their objects -- whence a wealth of emotion is squandered .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 24]: It is long before we discover that far richer feeling is the result of a regard bent on the profound and the pure .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 60]: Hence the chief harm the poems did Alec , consisted in the rousing of his strongest feelings towards imaginary objects of inferior excellence , with the necessary result of a tendency to measure the worth of the passions themselves by their strength alone , and not by their character -- by their degree , and not by their kind .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 37]: That they were the forge-bellows , supplying the blast of the imagination to the fire of love in which his life had begun to be remodelled , is not to be counted among their injurious influences .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 24]: He had never hitherto meddled with his own thoughts or feelings -- had lived an external life to the most of his ability .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 53]: Now , through falling in love , and reading Byron , he began to know the existence of a world of feeling , if not of thought ; while his attempts at conversation with the girls had a condensing if not crystallizing influence upon the merely vaporous sensations which the poetry produced .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 36]: All that was wanted to give full force to the other influences in adding its own , was the presence of the sultry evenings of summer , with the thunder gathering in the dusky air .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 42]: The cold days and nights of winter were now swathing that brain , through whose aerial regions the clouds of passion , driven on many shifting and opposing winds , were hurrying along to meet in human thunder and human rain .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 17]: I will not weary my readers with the talk of three young people enamoured of Byron .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 36]: Of course the feelings the girls had about him differed materially from those of Alec ; so that a great many of the replies and utterances met like unskilful tilters , whose staves passed wide .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 69]: In neither was the admiration much more than an uneasy delight in the vivid though indistinct images of pleasure raised by the magic of that `` physical force of words '' in which Byron excels all other English poets , and in virtue of which , I presume , the French persist in regarding Byron as our greatest poet , and in supposing that we agree with them .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 40]: Alec gained considerably with Kate from becoming able to talk about her favourite author , while she appeared to him more beautiful than ever -- the changes in the conversation constantly bringing out new phases on her changeful countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 44]: He began to discover now what I have already ventured to call the _ fluidity _ of her expression ; for he was almost startled every time he saw her , by finding her different from what he had expected to find her .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 32]: Jean Paul somewhere makes a lamentation over the fact that girls will never meet you in the morning with the same friendliness with which they parted from you the night before .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 11]: But this was not the kind of change Alec found .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 48]: She behaved with perfect evenness to him , but always _ looked _ different , so that he felt as if he could never know her quite -- which was a just conclusion , and might have been arrived at upon less remarkable though more important grounds .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 54]: Occasionally he would read something of Byron 's ; and it was a delight to him such as he had never known before , to see Kate 's strangely beautiful eyes flash with actual visible fire as he read , or cloud over with mist and fill slowly with the dew of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 26]: No doubt he took more of the credit than belonged to him -- which was greedy , seeing poor Byron had none of the pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 31]: Had it not been for the help Mr Cupples gave him towards the end of the session , he would have made a poor figure both in Greek and mathematics .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 59]: But he was so filled with the phantasm of Kate Fraser , that , although not insensible of his obligation to Mr Cupples , he regarded it lightly ; and , ready to give his life for a smile from Kate , took all his kindness , along with his drunken wisdom , as a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 24]: And when he next saw Annie and Curly , he did not speak to them quite so heartily as on his former return .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVII .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 32]: In one or two of his letters , which were never very long , Alec had just mentioned Kate ; and now Mrs Forbes had many inquiries to make about her .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 22]: Old feelings and thoughts awoke in her mind , and made her wish to see the daughter of her old companion .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 43]: The absence of Annie , banished once more at the suggestion of worldly prudence , but for whose quiet lunar smile not even Alec 's sunny presence could quite make up , contributed no doubt to this longing after the new maiden .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 31]: She wrote to Mr Fraser , asking him to allow his niece to pay her a visit of a few weeks ; but she said nothing about it to Alec .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 18]: The arrangement happened to be convenient to Mr Fraser , who wished to accept an invitation himself .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 23]: It was now the end of April ; and he proposed that the time should be fixed for the beginning of June .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 33]: When this favourable response arrived , Mrs Forbes gave Alec the letter to read , and saw the flush of delight that rose to his face as he gathered the welcome news .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 25]: Nor was this observation unpleasant to her ; for that Alec should at length marry one of her own people was a grateful idea .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 7]: Alec sped away into the fields .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 17]: To think that all these old familiar places would one day be glorified by her presence !
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 12]: that the daisies would bend beneath the foot of the goddess !
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 18]: and the everlasting hills put on a veil of tenderness from the reflex radiance of her regard !
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 35]: A flush of summer mantled over the face of nature , the flush of a deeper summer than that of the year -- of the joy that lies at the heart of all summers .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 30]: For a whole week of hail , sleet , and `` watery sunbeams '' followed , and yet in the eyes of Alec the face of nature still glowed .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 15]: When , after long expectation , the day arrived , Alec could not rest .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 53]: He wandered about all day , haunting his mother as she prepared his room for Kate , hurrying away with a sudden sense of the propriety of indifference , and hurrying back on some cunning pretext , while his mother smiled to herself at his eagerness and the transparency of his artifice .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 16]: At length , as the hour drew near , he could restrain himself no longer .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 28]: He rushed to the stable , saddled his pony , which was in nearly as high spirits as himself , and galloped off to meet the mail .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 39]: The sun was nearing the west ; a slight shower had just fallen ; the thanks of the thirsty earth were ascending in odour ; and the wind was too gentle to shake the drops from the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 45]: To Alec , the wind of his own speed was the river that bore her towards him ; the odours were wafted from her approach ; and the sunset sleepiness around was the exhaustion of the region that longed for her Cyther an presence .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 34]: At last , as he turned a corner of the road , there was the coach ; and he had just time to wheel his pony about before it was up with him .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 27]: A little gloved hand greeted him ; the window was let down ; and the face he had been longing for shone out lovelier than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 70]: There was no inside passenger but herself ; and , leaning with one hand on the coach-door , he rode alongside till they drew near the place where the gig was waiting for them , when he dashed on , gave his pony to the man , was ready to help her as soon as the coach stopped , and so drove her home in triumph to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 41]: Where the coach stopped , on the opposite side of the way , a grassy field , which fell like a mantle from the shoulders of a hill crowned with firs , sloped down to the edge of the road .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 67]: From the coach , the sun was hidden behind a thick clump of trees , but his rays , now red with rich age , flowed in a wide stream over the grass , and shone on an old Scotch fir which stood a yard or two from the highway , making its red bark glow like the pools which the prophet saw in the desert .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 61]: At the foot of this tree sat Tibbie Dyster ; and from her red cloak the level sun-tide was thrown back in gorgeous glory ; so that the eyeless woman , who only felt the warmth of the great orb , seemed , in her effulgence of luminous red , to be the light-fountain whence that torrent of rubescence burst .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 35]: From her it streamed up to the stem and along the branches of the glowing fir ; from her it streamed over the radiant grass of the up-sloping field away towards the western sun .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 26]: But the only one who saw the splendour was a shoemaker , who rubbed his rosiny hands together , and felt happy without knowing why .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 18]: Alec would have found it difficult to say whether or not he had seen the red cloak .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 40]: But from the shadowy side of it there were eyes shining upon him , with a deeper and truer , if with a calmer , or , say , colder devotion , than that with which he regarded Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 19]: The most powerful rays that fall from the sun are neither those of colour nor those of heat .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 15]: -- Annie sat by Tibbie 's side -- the side away from the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 112]: If the East and the West might take human shape -- come forth in their Oreads from their hill-tops , and meet half-way between -- there they were seated side by side : Tibbie , old , scarred , blind Tibbie , was of the west and the sunset , the centre of a blood-red splendour ; cold , gentle Annie , with her dark hair , blue eyes , and the sad wisdom of her pale face , was of the sun-deserted east , between whose gray clouds , faintly smiling back the rosiness of the sun 's triumphal death , two or three cold stars were waiting to glimmer .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 99]: Tibbie had come out to bask a little , and , in the dark warmth of the material sun , to worship that Sun whose light she saw in the hidden world of her heart , and who is the Sun of all the worlds ; to breathe the air , which , through her prison-bars , spoke of freedom ; to give herself room to long for the hour when the loving Father would take her out of the husk which infolded her , and say to her : '' _ See , my child _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 40]: With the rest of the travailing creation , she was groaning in hopeful pain -- not in the pain of the mother , but in the pain of the child , soon to be forgotten in the following rest .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 51]: If my younger readers want to follow Kate and Alec home , they will take it for a symptom of the chill approach of `` unlovely age , '' that I say to them : ` We will go home with Tibbie and Annie , and hear what they say .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 17]: I like better to tell you about ugly blind old Tibbie than about beautiful young Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 8]: -- But you shall have your turn .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 16]: Do not think that we old people do not care for what you care for .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 20]: We want more than you want -- a something without which what you like best can not last . '
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 13]: `` What did the coch stop for , Annie , lass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 12]: asked Tibbie , as soon as the mail had driven on .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 14]: `` It 's a lady gaein to Mistress Forbes 's at Howglen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 8]: `` Hoo ken ye that ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 20]: 'Cause Alec Forbes rade oot to meet her , and syne took her hame i ' the gig . ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 19]: I thought I heard mair nor the ordinar nummer o ' horse-feet as the coch cam ' up .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 13]: He 's a braw lad , that Alec Forbes isna he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 54]: `` Ay is he , '' answered Annie , sadly ; not from jealousy , for her admiration of Alec was from afar ; but as looking up from purgatorial exclusion to the paradise of Howglen , where the beautiful lady would have all Mrs Forbes , and Alec too , to herself .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 11]: The old woman caught the tone , but misinterpreted it .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 19]: `` I doobt , '' she said , `` he winna get ony guid at that college . ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 6]: `` What for no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 3]: returned Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 24]: `` I was at the school wi ' him , and never saw onything to fin ' fau ' t wi ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 6]: `` Ow na , lassie .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 16]: Ye had naething to do fin ` in ' fau ' t wi ' him .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 23]: His father was a douce man , an ' maybe a God-fearin ' man , though he made but sma ' profession .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 23]: I think we 're whiles ower sair upo ' some o ' them that promises little , and maybe does the mair .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 38]: Ye min ' what ye read to me afore we cam ' oot thegither , aboot the lad that said till 's father , _ I go not _ ; but afterwards he repented and gaed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 4]: `` Ay . ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 12]: `` Weel , I think we 'll gang hame noo . ''
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 56]: They rose , and went , hand in hand , over the bridge , and round the end of its parapet , and down the steep descent to the cottage at its foot , Tibbie 's cloak shining all the way , but , now that the sun was down , with a chastened radiance .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 55]: When she had laid it aside , and was seated on her low wooden chair within reach of her spinning-wheel , `` Noo , '' said Tibbie , `` ye 'll jist read a chapter till me , lassie , afore ye gang hame , and syne I s ' gang to my bed .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 15]: Blin ` ness is a sair savin ' o ' can ` les . ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 31]: She forgot that it was summer , when , in those northern regions , the night has no time to gather before the sun is flashing again in the east .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 23]: The chapter Annie chose was the ninth of St John 's Gospel , about Jesus curing the man blind from his birth .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 23]: When she had finished , Annie said , `` Michtna he cure you , Tibbie , gin ye spiered at him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 14]: `` Ay micht he , and ay will he , '' answered Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 10]: `` I 'm only jist bidin ' his time .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 19]: But I 'm thinkin ' he 'll cure me better yet nor he cured that blin ' man .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 36]: He 'll jist tak ' the body aff o ' me a ` thegither , and syne I 'll see , no wi ' een like yours , but wi ' my haill speeritual body .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 20]: Ye min ' that verse i ' the prophecees o ' Ezakiel : I ke n't weel by hert .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 42]: It says : ` And their whole boady , and their backs , and their han 's , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes roon aboot , even the wheels that they four had . '
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 7]: Isna that a gran ' text ?
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 32]: I wiss Mr Turnbull wad tak ' it into his heid to preach frae that text sometime afore it comes , which winna be that lang , I 'm thinkin ' .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 13]: The wheels 'll be stoppin ' at my door or lang . ''
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 9]: `` What gars ye think that , Tibbie ?
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 18]: There 's no sign o ' deith aboot you , I 'm sure , '' said Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 11]: `` Weel , ye see , I canna weel say .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 26]: Blin ' fowk somehoo kens mair nor ither fowk aboot things that the sicht o ' the een has unco little to do wi ' .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 5]: But never min ' .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 16]: I 'm willin ' to bide i ' the dark as lang as He likes .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 48]: It 's eneuch for ony bairn to ken that its father 's stan ` in ' i ' the licht , and seein ' a ' aboot him , and sae weel able to guide hit , though it kensna whaur to set doon its fit neist .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 10]: And I wat He 's i ' the licht .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 36]: Ye min ' that bit aboot the Lord pittin ' Moses intil a clift o ' the rock , and syne coverin ' him wi ' his han ' till he was by him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 10]: `` Ay , fine that , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 114]: `` Weel , I canna help thinkin ' whiles , that the dark aboot me 's jist the how o ' the Lord 's han ' ; and I 'm like Moses , only wi ' this differ , that whan the Lord tak 's his han ' aff o ' me , it 'll be to lat me luik i ' the face o ' him , and no to lat me see only his back pairts , which was a ' that he had the sicht o ' ; for ye see Moses was i ' the body , and cudna bide the sicht o ' the face o ' God .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 11]: I daursay it wad hae blin ' ' t him .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 14]: I hae heard that ower muckle licht 'll ca fowk blin ' whiles .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 7]: What think ye , lassie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 11]: `` Ay ; the lichtnin ' blin 's fowk whiles .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 21]: And gin I luik straucht at the sun , I can see nothing efter ' t for a whilie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 7]: `` I tell ye sae ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 4]: exclaimed Tibbie triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 16]: `` And do ye min ' the veesion that the apostle John saw in Pawtmos ?
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 41]: I reckon he micht hae thocht lang there , a ' him lane , gin it hadna been for the bonnie things , and the gran ' things , and the terrible things ` at the Lord loot him see .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 8]: They _ war _ gran ' sichts !
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 30]: It was the veesion o ' the Saviour himsel ' -- Christ himsel ' ; and he says that his coontenance was as the sun shineth in his strength .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 10]: What think ye o ' that , lass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 11]: This was not a question , but an exulting exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 29]: The vision in Patmos proved that although Moses must not see the face of God because of its brightness , a more favoured prophet might have the vision .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 64]: And Tibbie , who had a share in the privileges of the new covenant , who was not under the law like Moses , but under grace like John , would one day see the veil of her blindness shrivel away from before her deeper eyes , burnt up by the glory of that face of God , which is a consuming fire .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 11]: -- I suppose that Tibbie was right in the main .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 97]: But was it not another kind of brightness , a brightness without effulgence , a brightness grander and more glorious , shining in love and patience , and tenderness and forgiveness and excuse , that Moses was unfit to see , because he was not well able to understand it , until , ages after , he descended from heaven upon the Mount of Transfiguration , and the humble son of God went up from the lower earth to meet him there , and talk with him face to face as a man with his friend ?
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 7]: Annie went home to her garret .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 19]: It was a singular experience the child had in the changes that came to her with the seasons .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 44]: The winter with its frost and bitter winds brought her a home at Howglen ; the summer , whose airs were molten kisses , took it away , and gave her the face of nature instead of the face of a human mother .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 107]: For the snug little chamber in which she heard with a quiet exultation the fierce rush of the hail-scattering tempest against the window , or the fluffy fall of the snow-flakes , like hands of fairy babies patting the glass , and fancied herself out in the careering storm , hovering on the wings of the wind over the house in which she lay soft and warm -- she had now the garret room , in which the curtainless bed , with its bare poles , looked like a vessel in distress at sea , and through the roof of which the winds found easy way .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 26]: But the winds were warm now , and through the skylight the sunbeams illuminated the floor , showing all the rat-holes and wretchedness of decay .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 25]: There was comfort out of doors in the daytime -- in the sky and the fields and all the `` goings-on of life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 21]: And this night , after this talk with Tibbie , Annie did not much mind going back to the garret .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 18]: Nor did she lie awake to think about the beautiful lady Alec had taken home with him .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 12]: And she dreamed again that she saw the Son of Man .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 62]: There was a veil over his face like the veil that Moses wore , but the face was so bright that it almost melted the veil away , and she saw what made her love that face more than the presence of Alec , more than the kindness of Mrs Forbes or Dowie , more than the memory of her father .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVIII .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 8]: Alec did not fall asleep so soon .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 19]: The thought that Kate was in the house -- asleep in the next room , kept him awake .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 10]: Yet he woke the next morning earlier than usual .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 20]: There were bands of golden light upon the wall , though Kate would not be awake for hours yet .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 15]: He sprung out of bed , and ran to the banks of the Glamour .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 12]: Upon the cold morning stream the sun-rays fell slanting and gentle .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 21]: He plunged in , and washed the dreams from his eyes with a dive , and a swim under water .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 43]: Then he rose to the surface and swam slowly about under the overhanging willows , and earthy banks hollowed by the river 's flow into cold damp caves , up into the brown shadows of which the water cast a flickering shimmer .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 25]: Then he dressed himself , and lay down on the meadow grass , each blade of which shadowed its neighbour in the slant sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 38]: Cool as it still was with the coldness of the vanished twilight , it yet felt warm to his bare feet , fresh from the waters that had crept down through the night from the high moor-lands .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 23]: He fell fast asleep , and the sheep came and fed about him , as if he had been one of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 45]: When he woke , the sun was high ; and when he reached the house , he found his mother and Kate already seated at breakfast -- Kate in the prettiest of cotton dresses , looking as fresh and country-like as the morning itself .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 25]: The window was open , and through the encircling ivy , as through a filter of shadows , the air came fresh and cool .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 57]: Beyond the shadow of the house lay the sunshine , a warm sea of brooding glory , of still power ; not the power of flashing into storms of splendour beneath strange winds , but of waking up and cherishing to beauty the shy life that lay hidden in all remotest corners of the teeming earth .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 14]: `` What are you going to do with Kate to-day , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 9]: `` Whatever Kate likes , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 10]: `` I have no choice , '' returned Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 13]: `` I do n't know yet what I have to choose between .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 9]: I am in your hands , Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 25]: It was the first time she had called him by his name , and a spear of sunshine seemed to quiver in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 11]: He was restless as a hyena till she was ready .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 28]: He then led her to the banks of the river , here low and grassy , with plenty of wild flowers , and a low babblement everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 9]: `` This is delightful , '' said Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 19]: `` I will come here as often as you like , and you shall read to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 6]: `` What shall I read ?
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 11]: Would you like one of Sir Walter 's novels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 6]: `` Just the thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 9]: Alec started at full speed for the house .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 7]: `` Stop , '' cried Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 16]: `` You are not going to leave me alone beside this -- talking water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 12]: `` I thought you liked the water , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 12]: But I do n't want to be left alone beside it .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 12]: I will go with you , and get some work . ''
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 17]: She turned away from the stream with a strange backward look , and they walked home .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 40]: But as Kate showed some disinclination to return to the river-side , Alec put a seat for her near the house , in the shadow of a silver birch , and threw himself on the grass at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 39]: There he began to read the _ Antiquary _ , only half understanding it , in the enchantment of knowing that he was lying at her feet , and had only to look up to see her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 49]: At noon , Mrs Forbes sent them a dish of curds , and a great jug of cream , with oatcakes , and butter soft from the churn ; and the rippling shadow of the birch played over the white curds and the golden butter as they ate .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 14]: Am I not now fairly afloat upon the gentle stream of an idyl ?
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 24]: Shall I watch the banks as they glide past , and record each fairy-headed flower that looks at its image in the wave ?
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 14]: Or shall I mow them down and sweep them together in a sentence ?
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 14]: I will gather a few of the flowers , and leave the rest .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 14]: But first I will make a remark or two upon the young people .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 39]: Those amongst my readers who have had the happiness to lead innocent boy-lives , will know what a marvellous delight it was to Alec to have this girl near him in his own home and his own haunts .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 26]: He never speculated on her character or nature , any more than Hamlet did about those of Ophelia before he was compelled to doubt womankind .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 19]: His own principles were existent only in a latent condition , undeveloped from good impulses and kind sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 55]: For instance : he would help any one whose necessity happened to make an impression upon him , but he never took pains to enter into the feelings of others -- to understand them from their own point of view : he never had said to himself , `` That is another me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 16]: Correspondent to this condition were some of Kate 's theories of life and its duties .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 21]: The question came up , whether a certain lady in fiction had done right in running away with her lover .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 11]: Mrs Forbes made a rather decided remark on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 9]: Kate said nothing , but her face glowed .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 16]: `` Tell us what you think about it , Katie , '' said Mrs Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 7]: Katie was silent for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 57]: Then with the air of a martyr , from whom the rack can only extort a fuller confession of his faith -- though I fear she had no deeper gospel at the root of it than Byron had brought her -- she answered : `` I think a woman must give up everything for love . ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 18]: She was then precisely of the same opinion as Jean Paul 's Linda in _ Titan _ .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 26]: `` That is very true , I daresay , '' said Mrs Forbes ; `` but I fear you mean only one kind of love .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 18]: Does a woman owe no love to her father or mother because she has a lover ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 18]: To this plain question Kate made no reply , but her look changed to one of obstinacy .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 57]: Her mother died when she was a child , and her father had kept himself shut up in his study , leaving her chiefly to the care of a Shetland nurse , who told her Scandinavian stories from morning to night , with invention ever ready to supply any blank in the tablets of her memory .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 39]: Alec thought his mother 's opinion the more to be approved , and Kate 's the more to be admired ; showing the lack of entireness in his nature , by thus dissociating the good and the admirable .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 16]: That which is best can not be less admirable than that which is not best .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIX .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 33]: The next day saw Alec walking by the side of Kate mounted on his pony , up a steep path to the top of one of the highest hills surrounding the valley .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 40]: It was a wild hill , with hardly anything growing on it but heather , which would make it regal with purple in the autumn : no tree could stand the blasts that blew over that hill in winter .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 12]: Having climbed to the topmost point , they stood and gazed .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 23]: The country lay outstretched beneath in the glow of the June day , while around them flitted the cool airs of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 33]: Above them rose the soaring blue of the June sky , with a white cloud or two floating in it , and a blue peak or two leaning its colour against it .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 32]: Through the green grass and the green corn below crept two silvery threads , meeting far away and flowing in one -- the two rivers which watered the valley of Strathglamour .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 17]: Between the rivers lay the gray stone town , with its roofs of thatch and slate .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 32]: One of its main streets stopped suddenly at the bridge with the three arches above Tibbie 's cottage ; and at the other end of the bridge lay the green fields .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 39]: The landscape was not one of the most beautiful , but it had a beauty of its own , which is all a country or a woman needs ; and Kate sat gazing about her in evident delight .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 34]: She had taken off her hat to feel the wind , and her hair fell in golden heaps upon her shoulders , and the wind and the sunbeams played at hide-and-seek in it .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 10]: In a moment the pleasure vanished from her face .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 13]: It clouded over , while the country lay full in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 14]: Her eyes no longer looked wide abroad , but expressed defeat and retirement .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 9]: Listlessly she began to gather her hair together .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 17]: `` Do you ever feel as if you could not get room enough , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 5]: she said , wearily .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 15]: `` No , I do n't , '' he answered , honestly and stupidly .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 10]: `` I have always as much as I want .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 11]: I should have thought you would -- up here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 16]: `` I did feel satisfied for a moment ; but it was only a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 6]: It is all gone now .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 8]: I shall never have room enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 8]: Alec had nothing to say in reply .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 18]: He never had anything to give Kate but love ; and now he gave her more love .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 8]: It was all he was rich in .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 9]: But she did not care for his riches .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 14]: And so , after gazing a while , she turned towards the descent .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 16]: Alec picked up her hat , and took his place at the pony 's head .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 12]: He was not so happy as he thought he should be .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 20]: Somehow she was of another order , and he could not understand her -- he could only worship her .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 30]: The whole of the hot afternoon they spent on the grass , whose mottling of white clover filled the wandering airs with the odours of the honey of Hymettus .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 19]: And after tea Kate sang , and Alec drank every tone as if his soul lived by hearing .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 24]: In this region the sun works long after hours in the summer , and they went out to see him go down weary .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 20]: They leaned together over the gate and looked at the level glory , which now burned red and dim .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 34]: Lamp of life , it burns all night long in the eternal night of the universe , to chase the primeval darkness from the great entrance hall of the `` human mortals . ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 9]: `` What a long shadow everything throws ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 3]: said Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 18]: `` When the shadows gather all together , and melt into one , then it is night .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 26]: Look how the light creeps about the roots of the grass on the ridge , as if it were looking for something between the shadows .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 7]: They are both going to die .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 5]: Now they begin . ''
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 16]: The sun diminished to a star -- a spark of crimson fire , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 29]: As if he had sunk in a pool of air , and made it overflow , a gentle ripple of wind blew from the sunset over the grass .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 19]: They could see the grass bending and swaying and bathing in its coolness before it came to them .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 28]: It blew on their faces at length , and whispered something they could not understand , making Kate think of her mother , and Alec of Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 33]: Now that same breeze blew upon Tibbie and Annie , as they sat in the patch of meadow by the cottage , between the river and the _ litster 's dam _ .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 19]: It made Tibbie think of death , the opener of sleeping eyes , the uplifter of hanging hands .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 24]: For Tibbie 's darkness was the shadow of her grave , on the further border of which the light was breaking in music .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 12]: Death and resurrection were the same thing to blind old Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 58]: When the gentle , washing wind blew upon Annie , she thought of the wind that bloweth were it listeth ; and that , if ever the Spirit of God blew upon her , she would feel it just like that wind of summer sunset -- so cool , so blessed , so gentle , so living !
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 12]: And was it not God that breathed that wind upon her ?
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 15]: Was he not even then breathing his Spirit into the soul of that woman-child ?
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 23]: It blew upon Andrew Constable , as he stood in his shop-door , the easy labour of his day all but over .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 33]: And he said to his little weasel-faced , _ douce _ , old-fashioned child who stood leaning against the other door-cheek : `` That 's a fine caller bit blastie , Isie !
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 19]: Dinna ye like to fin ' ' t blawin ' upo ' yer het cheeks , dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 26]: And she answered , `` Ay , I like it weel , daddie ; but it min 's me some upo ' the winter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 36]: And Andrew looked anxiously at the pale face of his child , who , at six years old , in the month of June , had no business to know that there was any winter .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 27]: But she was the child of elderly parents , and had not been born in time ; so that she was now in reality about twenty .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 28]: It blew upon Robert Bruce , who had just run out into the _ yard _ , to see how his potatoes and cabbages were coming on .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 19]: He said `` It 's some cauld , '' and ran in again to put on his hat .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 15]: Alec and Kate , I have said , stood looking into the darkening field .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 30]: A great flock of rooks which filled the air with their rooky gossip , was flying straight home to an old gray ruin just visible amongst some ancient trees .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 17]: They had been gathering worms and grubs all day , and now it was bed time .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 31]: They felt , through all their black feathers , the coolness of that evening breeze which came from the cloudy mausoleum already built over the grave of the down-gone sun .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 33]: Kate hearing them rejoicing far overhead , searched for them in the darkening sky , found them , and watched their flight , till the black specks were dissolved in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 35]: They are not the most poetic of birds , but in a darkening country twilight , over silent fields , they blend into the general tone , till even their noisy caw suggests repose .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 10]: But it was room Kate wanted , not rest .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 28]: She would know one day , however , that room and rest are the same , and that the longings for both spring from the same need .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 10]: `` What place is that in the trees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 11]: `` The old Castle of Glamerton , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 11]: `` Would you like to go and see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 7]: `` Yes ; very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 9]: `` We 'll go to-morrow , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 20]: `` The dew is beginning to fall , Kate , '' said Mrs Forbes , who now joined them .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 8]: `` You had better come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 4]: Alec lingered behind .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 10]: An unknown emotion drew his heart towards the earth .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 31]: He would see her go to sleep in the twilight , which was now beginning to brood over her , as with the brown wings of a lovely dull-hued hen-bird .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 63]: The daisies were all asleep , spotting the green grass with stars of carmine ; for their closed red tips , like the finger-points of two fairy hands , tenderly joined together , pointed up in little cones to keep the yellow stars warm within , that they might shine bright when the great star of day came to look for them .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 86]: The light of the down-gone sun , the garment of Aurora , which , so short would be her rest , she had not drawn close around her on her couch , floated up on the horizon , and swept slowly northwards , lightly upborne on that pale sea of delicate green and gold , to flicker all night around the northern coast of the sky , and , streaming up in the heavens , melt at last in the glory of the uprisen Titan .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 15]: The trees stood still and shadowy as clouds , but breathing out mysterious odours .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 32]: The stars overhead , half-molten away in the ghostly light that would not go , were yet busy at their night-work , ministering to the dark sides of the other worlds .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 5]: There was no moon .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 41]: A wide stillness and peace , as of a heart at rest , filled space , and lying upon the human souls with a persistent quietness that might be felt , made them know what _ might _ be theirs .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 17]: Now and then a bird sprang out with a sudden tremor of leaves , suddenly stilled .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 29]: But the bats came and went in silence , like feelings yet unembodied in thoughts , vanishing before the sight had time to be startled at their appearing .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 4]: All was marvel .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 17]: And the marvel of all was there -- where the light glimmered faintly through the foliage .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 26]: He approached the house with an awe akin to that with which an old poetic Egyptian drew near to the chamber of the goddess Isis .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 10]: He entered , and his Isis was laughing merrily .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 65]: In the morning , great sun-crested clouds with dark sides hung overhead ; and while they sat at breakfast , one of those glorious showers , each of whose great drops carries a sun-spark in its heart , fell on the walks with a tumult of gentle noises , and on the grass almost as silently as if it had been another mossy cloud .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 47]: The leaves of the ivy hanging over the windows quivered and shook , each for itself , beneath the drops ; and between the drops , one of which would have beaten him to the earth , wound and darted in safety a great humble bee .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 27]: Kate and Alec went to the open window and looked out on the rainy world , breathing the odours released from the grass and the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 21]: Alec turned from the window to Kate 's face , and saw upon it a keen , yet solemn delight .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 13]: But as he gazed , he saw a cloud come over it .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 17]: The arched upper lip dropped sadly upon the other , and she looked troubled and cold .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 9]: Instinctively he glanced out again for the cause .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 22]: The rain had become thick and small , and a light opposing wind disordered its descent with broken and crossing lines .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 32]: This change from a summer to a winter rain had altered Kate 's mood , and her face was now , as always , a reflex of the face of nature .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 16]: `` Shut the window , please Alec , '' she said , with a shiver .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 12]: `` We 'll have a fire directly , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 13]: `` No , no , '' returned Kate , trying to smile .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 14]: `` Just fetch me a shawl from the closet in my room . ''
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 12]: Alec had not been in his own room since Kate came .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 22]: He entered it with a kind of gentle awe , and stood just within the door , gazing as if rebuked .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 17]: From a pair of tiny shoes under the dressing-table , radiated a whole roomful of feminity .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 19]: He was almost afraid to go further , and would not have dared to look in the mirror .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 12]: In three days her mere presence had made the room marvellous .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 24]: Recovering himself , he hastened to the cloaet , got the shawl , and went down the stair three steps at a time .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 10]: `` Could n't you find it , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 3]: said Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 17]: yes ; I found it at once , '' answered Alec , blushing to the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 11]: I wonder whether Kate guessed what made the boy blush .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 8]: But it does not matter much now .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 10]: She did look curiously at him for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 12]: `` Just help me with my shawl , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 18]: CHAPTER L. During all this time , Annie had seen scarcely anything of her aunt Margaret Anderson .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 32]: Ever since Bruce had offended her , on the occasion of her first visit , she had taken her custom elsewhere , and had never even called to see her niece .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 15]: Annie had met her several times in the street , and that was all .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 46]: Hence , on one of the fine afternoons of that unusually fine summer , and partly , perhaps , from missing the kindness of Mrs Forbes , Annie took a longing to see her old aunt , and set out for Clippenstrae to visit her .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 21]: It was a walk of two miles , chiefly along the high road , bordered in part by accessible plantation .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 30]: Through this she loitered along , enjoying the few wild flowers and the many lights and shadows , so that it was almost evening before she reached her destination .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 6]: `` Preserve 's a ' !
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 14]: Annie Anderson , what brings ye here this time o ' nicht ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 4]: exclaimed her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 21]: `` It 's a lang time sin I saw ye , auntie , and I wantit to see ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 8]: `` Weel , come butt the hoose .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 25]: Ye 're growin ' a great muckle quean , '' said her aunt , inclined to a favourable consideration of her by her growth .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 20]: Margaret `` didna like bairns -- menseless craturs -- aye wantin ' ither fowk to do for them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 38]: But growth was a kind of regenerating process in her eyes , and when a girl began to look like a woman , she regarded it as an outward sign of conversion , or something equally valuable .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 32]: -- So she conducted her into the presence of her uncle , a little old man , worn and bent , with gray locks peeping out from under a Highland bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 13]: `` This is my brither Jeames 's bairn , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 54]: The old man received her kindly , called her his dawtie , and made her sit down by him on a three-legged _ creepie _ , talking to her as if she had been quite a child , while she , capable of high converse as she was , replied in corresponding terms .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 10]: Her great-aunt was confined to her bed with rheumatism .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 28]: Supper was preparing , and Annie was not sorry to have a share , for indeed , during the summer , her meals were often scanty enough .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 21]: While they ate , the old man kept helping her to the best , talking to her all the time .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 14]: `` Will ye no come and bide wi ' me , dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 9]: he said , meaning little by the question .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 11]: `` Na , na , '' answered Margaret for her .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 22]: `` She 's at the schule , ye ken , uncle , and we maunna interfere wi ' her schoolin . '
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 20]: -- Hoo does that leein ' ted , Robert Bruce , carry himsel ' to ye , bairn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 11]: I jist never min ' him , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 14]: `` Weel , it 's a ' he deserves at your han ' .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 29]: But gin I war you , I wad let him ken that gin he saws your corn ye hae a richt to raither mair nor his gleanins . ''
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 12]: `` I dinna ken what ye mean , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 6]: na ; I daursay no .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 50]: But ye may jist as weel ken noo , that that ted , Robert Bruce , has twa hunner poun ' odd o ' yer ain , lassie ; and gin he doesna use ye weel , ye can jist tell him ` at I telt ye sae . ''
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 20]: This piece of news had not the overpowering effect upon Annie which , perhaps , her aunt had expected .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 18]: No doubt the money seemed in her eyes a limitless fortune ; but then Bruce had it .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 19]: She might as soon think of robbing a bear of her whelps as getting her own from Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 13]: Besides , what could she do with it if she had it ?
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 16]: And she had not yet acquired the faculty of loving money for its own sake .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 26]: When she rose to take her leave , she felt little richer than when she entered , save for the kind words of John Peterson .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 21]: `` It 's ower late for ye to gang hame yer lane , dawtie , '' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 11]: `` I 'm nae that fleyt , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 43]: `` Weel , gin ye walk wi ' Him , the mirk 'll be licht aboot ye , '' said he , taking off his Highland bonnet , and looking up with a silent recognition of the care of _ Him _ .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 25]: `` Be a gude lass , '' he resumed , replacing his bonnet , `` an ' rin hame as fest 's ye can .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 8]: Gude nicht to ye , dawtie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 27]: Rejoicing as if she had found her long-lost home , Annie went out into the deep gloamin feeling it impossible she should be frightened at anything .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 49]: But when she came to the part of the road bordered with trees , she could not help fancying she saw a figure flitting along from tree to tree just within the deeper dusk of the wood , and as she hurried on , fancy grew to fear .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 14]: Presently she heard awful sounds , like the subdued growling of wild beasts .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 28]: She would have taken to her heels in terror , but she reflected that thereby she would only insure pursuit , whereas she might slip away unperceived .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 25]: As she reached a stile leading into the wood , however , a dusky figure came bounding over it , and advanced towards her .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 26]: To her relief it went on two legs ; and when it came nearer she thought she recognized some traits of old acquaintance about it .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 31]: When it was within a couple of yards of her , as she still pursued her way towards Glamerton , she stopped and cried out joyfully : `` Curly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 8]: -- for it was her old vice-champion .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 4]: `` Annie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 6]: was the equally joyful response .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 10]: `` I thocht ye was a wild beast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 3]: said Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 36]: `` I was only growlin ' for fun to mysel ' , '' answered Curly , who would have done it all the more if he had known there was any one on the road .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 12]: `` I didna ken ` at I was fleggin ' onybody .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 8]: An ' hoo are ye , Annie ?
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 8]: An ' hoo 's Blister Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 8]: For Curly was dreadfully prolific in nicknames .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 9]: Annie had not seen him for six months .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 51]: He had continued to show himself so full of mischief , though of a comparatively innocent sort , that his father thought it better at last to send him to a town at some distance to learn the trade of a saddler , for which he had shown a preference .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 9]: This was his first visit to his home .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 18]: Hitherto his father had received no complaints of his behaviour , and had now begged a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 12]: `` Ye 're grown sair , Annie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 11]: `` Sae are ye , Curly , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 8]: `` An ' hoo 's Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 7]: `` He 's verra weel . ''
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 11]: Whereupon much talk followed , which need not be recorded .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 13]: At length Curly said : `` And hoo 's the rottans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 8]: `` Ower weel and thrivin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 20]: `` Jist pit yer han ' i ' my coat-pooch , and see what I hae broucht ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 8]: Knowing Curly 's propensities , Annie refused .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 11]: `` It 's a wild beast , '' said Curly .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 10]: `` I 'll lat it oot upo ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 18]: It was it ` at made a ' that roarin ' i ' the plantin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 36]: So saying , he pulled out of his pocket the most delicate tortoiseshell kitten , not half the beauty of which could be perceived in the gloamin , which is all the northern summer night .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 22]: He threw it at Annie , but she had seen enough not to be afraid to catch it in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 17]: `` Did ye fess this a ' the road frae Spinnie to me , Curly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 7]: `` Ay did I , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 7]: Ye see I dinna like rottans .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 26]: But ye maun haud it oot o ' their gait for a feow weeks , or they 'll rive ' t a ' to bits .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 16]: It 'll sune be a match for them though , I s ' warran ' .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 10]: She comes o ' a killin ' breed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 14]: Annie took the kitten home , and it shared her bed that night .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 7]: `` What 's that meowlin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 17]: asked Bruce the next morning , the moment he rose from the genuflexion of morning prayers .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 11]: `` It 's my kittlin ' , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 38]: `` I 'll lat ye see ` t. '' `` We hae ower mony mou 's i ' the hoose already , '' said Bruce , as she returned with the little peering baby-animal in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 8]: `` We hae nae room for mair .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 35]: Here , Rob , tak the cratur , an ' pit a tow aboot its neck , an ' a stane to the tow , an ' fling ' t into the Glamour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 15]: Annie , not waiting to parley , darted from the house with the kitten .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 24]: `` Rin efter her , Rob , '' said Bruce , `` an ' tak ' it frae her , and droo n't .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 9]: We canna hae the hoose swarmin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 10]: Bob bolted after her , delighted with his commission .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 30]: But instead of finding her at the door , as he had expected , he saw her already a long way up the street , flying like the wind .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 6]: He started in keen pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 24]: He was now a great lumbering boy , and although Annie 's wind was not equal to his , she was more fleet .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 15]: She took the direct road to Howglen , and Rob kept floundering after her .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 18]: Before she reached the footbridge she was nearly breathless , and he was gaining fast upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 26]: Just as she turned the corner of the road , leading up on the other side of the water , she met Alec and Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 9]: Unable to speak , she passed without appeal .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 24]: But there was no need to ask the cause of her pale agonized face , for there was young Bruce at her heels .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 5]: Alec collared him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 8]: `` What are you up to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 9]: `` Naething , '' answered the panting pursuer .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 36]: `` Gin ye be efter naething , ye 'll fin ' that nearer hame , '' retorted Alec , twisting him round in that direction , and giving him a kick to expedite his return .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 35]: `` Lat me hear o ' you troublin ' Annie Anderson , an ' I 'll gar ye loup oot o ' yer skin the neist time I lay han 's upo ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 4]: Gang hame . ''
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 26]: Rob obeyed like a frightened dog , while Annie pursued her course to Howglen , as if her enemy had been still on her track .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 20]: Rushing into the parlour , she fell on the floor before Mrs Forbes , unable to utter a word .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 16]: The kitten sprung mewing out of her arms , and took refuge under the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 21]: `` Mem , mem , '' she gasped at length , `` tak ' care o ' my kittlin ' .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 6]: They want to droo n't .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 5]: It 's my ain .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 7]: Curly gied it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 11]: Mrs Forbes comforted her , and readily undertook the tutelage .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 19]: Annie was very late for school , for Mrs Forbes made her have another breakfast before she went .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 15]: But Mr Malison was in a good humour that day , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 7]: Rob Bruce looked devils at her .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 35]: What he had told his father I do not know ; but whatever it was , it was all written down in Bruce 's mental books to the debit of Alexander Forbes of Howglen .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 42]: Mrs Forbes 's heart smote her when she found to what persecution her little friend was exposed during those times when her favour was practically although not really withdrawn ; but she did not see how she could well remedy it .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 35]: She was herself in the power of Bruce , and expostulation from her would be worth little ; while to have Annie to the house as before would involve consequences unpleasant to all concerned .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 57]: She resolved to make up for it by being kinder to her than ever as soon as Alec should have followed Kate to the precincts of the university ; while for the present she comforted both herself and Annie by telling her to be sure to come to her when she found herself in any trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 20]: But Annie was not one to apply to her friends except she was in great need of their help .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 11]: The present case had been one of life and death .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 17]: She found no further occasion to visit Mrs Forbes before Kate and Alec were both gone .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 3]: CHAPTER LI .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 37]: On a sleepy summer afternoon , just when the sunshine begins to turn yellow , Annie was sitting with Tibbie on the grass in front of her little cottage , whose door looked up the river .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 15]: The cottage stood on a small rocky eminence at the foot of the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 35]: Underneath the approach to it from the bridge , the dyer 's mill-race ran by a passage cut in the rock , leading to the third arch of the bridge built over the Glamour .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 14]: Towards the river , the rock went down steep to the little meadow .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 34]: It was a triangular piece of smooth grass growing on the old bed of the river , which for many years had been leaving this side , and wearing away the opposite bank .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 26]: It lay between the river , the dyer 's race , and the bridge , one of the stone piers of which rose from it .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 14]: The grass which grew upon it was short , thick , and delicate .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 24]: On the opposite side of the river lay a field for bleaching the linen , which was the chief manufacture of that country .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 11]: Hence it enjoyed the privilege of immunity from the ploughshare .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 20]: None of its daisies ever met the fate of Burn 's `` Wee , modest , crimson-tippit flower . ''
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 49]: But indeed so constantly was the grass mown to keep it short , that there was scarcely a daisy to be seen in it , the long broad lines of white linen usurping their place , and in their stead keeping up the contrast of white and green .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 27]: Around Tibbie and Annie however the daisies were shining back to the sun , confidently , with their hearts of gold and their rays of silver .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 30]: And the butter-cups were all of gold ; and the queen-of-the-meadow , which grew tall at the water-side , perfumed the whole region with her crown of silvery blossom .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 37]: Tibbie 's blind face was turned towards the sun ; and her hands were busy as ants with her knitting needles , for she was making a pair of worsted stockings for Annie against the winter .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 10]: No one could fit stockings so well as Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 10]: `` Wha 's that comin ' , lassie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 24]: Annie , who had heard no one , glanced round , and , rising , said , `` It 's Thomas Crann . ''
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 11]: `` That 's no Thomas Crann , '' rejoined Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 15]: `` I dinna hear the host -LRB- cough -RRB- o ' ` im . ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 10]: Thomas came up , pale and limping a little .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 8]: `` That 's no Thomas Crann ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 11]: repeated Tibbie , before he had time to address her .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 8]: `` What for no , Tibbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 4]: returned Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 10]: 'Cause I canna hear yer breath , Thamas . ''
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 17]: `` That 's a sign that I hae the mair o ' ` t , Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 39]: I 'm sae muckle better o ' that ashma , that I think whiles the Lord maun hae blawn into my nostrils anither breath o ' that life that he breathed first into Edam an ' Eve . ''
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 12]: `` I 'm richt glaid to hear ` t , Thamas .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 11]: Breath maun come frae him ae gait or ither . ''
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 7]: `` Nae doobt , Tibbie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 10]: `` Will ye sit doon asides 's , Thamas ?
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 11]: It 's lang sin ' I hae seen ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 9]: Tibbie always spoke of _ seeing _ people .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 7]: `` Ay will I , Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 12]: I haena muckle upo ' my han 's jist the day .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 13]: Ye see I haena won richt into my wark again yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 39]: `` Annie an ' me 's jist been haeing a crack thegither aboot this thing an ' that thing , Thamas , '' said Tibbie , dropping her knitting on her knees , and folding her palms together .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 44]: `` Maybe _ ye _ could tell me whether there be ony likeness atween the licht that I canna see and that soun ' o ' the water rinnin ' , aye rinnin ' , that I like sae weel to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 105]: For it did not need the gentle warm wind , floating rather than blowing down the river that afternoon , to bring to their ears the sound of the _ entick _ , or dam built across the river , to send the water to the dyer 's wheel ; for that sound was in Tibbie 's cottage day and night , mingled with the nearer , gentler , and stronger gurgling of the swift , deep , _ deedie _ water in the race , that hurried , aware of its work , with small noise and much soft-sliding force towards the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 45]: `` Weel , ye see , Tibbie , '' answered Thomas , `` it 's nearhan ' as ill for the like o ' us to unnerstan ' your blin ` ness as it may be for you to unnerstan ' oor sicht . ''
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 22]: `` Deed maybe neyther o ' 's kens muckle aboot oor ain gift either o ' sicht or blin ` ness .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 28]: -- Say onything ye like , gin ye dinna tell me , as the bairn here ance did , that I cudna ken what the licht was .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 18]: I kenna what yer sicht may be , and I 'm thinkin ' I care as little .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 10]: But weel ken I what the licht is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 11]: `` Tibbie , dinna be ill-nater 'd , like me .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 8]: Ye hae no call to that same .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 9]: I 'm tryin ' to answer your queston .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 17]: And gin ye interrup ' me again , I 'll rise an ' gang hame . ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 7]: `` Say awa ' , Thamas .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 4]: Never heed me .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 6]: I 'm some cankert whiles .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 7]: I ken that weel eneuch . ''
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 12]: `` Ye hae nae business to be cankert , Tibbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 8]: `` Nae mair nor ither fowk . ''
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 10]: `` Less , Tibbie ; less , woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 9]: `` Hoo mak ' ye that oot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 5]: asked Tibbie , defensively .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 14]: `` Ye dinna see the things to anger ye that ither fowk sees .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 45]: -- As I cam ' doon the street this minute , I cam ' upo ' twa laddies -- ye ken them -- they 're twins -- ane o ' them cripple -- '' `` Ay , that was Murdoch Malison 's wark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 7]: interposed Tibbie , with indignant reminiscence .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 31]: `` The man 's been sorry for ' t this mony a day , '' said Thomas ; `` sae we maunna come ower ' t again , Tibbie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 13]: `` Verra weel , Thamas ; I s ' haud my tongue .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 6]: What about the laddies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 57]: `` They war fechtin ' i ' the verra street ; ruggin ' ane anither 's heids , an ' peggin ' at ane anither 's noses , an ' doin ' their verra endeevour to destroy the image o ' the Almichty -- it wasna muckle o ' ' t that was left to blaud .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 8]: I teuk and throosh them baith . ''
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 16]: `` An ' what cam ' o ' the image o ' the Almichty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 19]: asked Tibbie , with a grotesque contortion of her mouth , and a roll of her veiled eyeballs .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 26]: `` I doobt , Thamas , '' she continued , `` ye angert yersel ' mair nor ye quaietit them wi ' the thrashin ' .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 20]: The wrath o ' man , ye ken , Thamas , worketh not the richtyisness o ' God . ''
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 35]: There was not a person in Glamerton who would have dared to speak thus to Thomas Crann but Tibbie Dyster , perhaps because there was not one who had such a respect for him .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 44]: Possibly the darkness about her made her bolder ; but I think it was her truth , which is another word for _ love _ , however unlike love the outcome may look , that made her able to speak in this fashion .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 8]: Thomas was silent for a long minute .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 15]: Then he said : `` Maybe ye 're i ' the richt , Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 37]: Ye aye anger me ; but I wad raither hae a body anger me wi ' tellin ' me the trowth , nor I wad hae a ' the fair words i ' the dictionar ' .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 31]: It 's a strange thing , wumman , but aye whan a body 's tryin ' maist to gang upricht he 's sure to catch a dreidfu ' fa ' .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 42]: There I hae been warstlin ' wi ' my ill-temper mair nor ever I did i ' my life afore ; and I never i ' my days lickit twa laddies for lickin ' ane anither till jist this verra day .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 12]: And I prayed against mysel ' afore I cam ' oot .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 23]: I canna win at the boddom o ' ` t. '' `` There 's waur things nor an ill temper , Thamas .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 8]: No that it 's bonnie ava ' .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 16]: And it 's nane like Him ` at was meek and lowly o ' hert .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 15]: But , as I say , there 's waur fauts nor an ill temper .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 61]: It wad be no gain to you , Thamas , and no glory to Him whase will 's your sanctification , gin ye war to owercome yer temper , and syne think a heap o ' yersel ' that ye had done ` t. Maybe that 's what for yer no allooed to be victorious in yer endeevours . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 12]: ` Deed , maybe , Tibbie , '' said Thomas solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 50]: `` And I 'm some doobtfu ' forbye , whether I mayna be tryin ' to ripe oot the stockin ' frae the wrang en ' o ' ` t. I doobt the fau ` t 's nae sae muckle i ' my temper as i ' my hert .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 10]: It 's mair love that I want , Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 39]: Gin I lo'ed my neebor as mysel ' , I cudna be sae ill-natert till him ; though ` deed , whiles , I 'm angry eneuch at mysel ' -- a hantle waur nor at him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 10]: `` Verra true , Thamas , '' answered Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 33]: `` Perfect love casteth oot fear , 'cause there 's nae room for the twa o ' them ; and I daursay it wad be the same wi ' the temper . ''
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 34]: `` But I 'm no gaein ' to gie in to bein ' ill-natert for a ' that , '' said Thomas , as if alarmed at the possible consequences of the conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 4]: `` Na na .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 7]: Resist ye the deevil , Thamas .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 6]: Haud at him , man .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 10]: He 's sure to rin at the lang last .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 19]: But I 'm feared ye 'll gang awa ' ohn tellt me aboot the licht and the water .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 96]: Whan I 'm sittin ' here o ' the girse , hearkenin ' to the water , as it comes murrin ' , and soufflin ' , and gurglin ' , on to me , and syne by me and awa ' , as gin it war spinnin ' and twistin ' a lot o ' bonnie wee sounies a ' intil ae muckle gran ' soun ' , it pits me i ' min ' o ' the text that says , ` His voice was as the sound o ' mony waters . '
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 13]: Noo his face is licht -- ye ken that , divna ye ?
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 25]: -- and gin his voice be like the water , there maun be something like atween the licht and the water , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 12]: That 's what garred me spier at ye , Thamas . ''
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 51]: `` Weel , I dinna ken richtly hoo to answer ye , Tibbie ; but at this moment the licht 's playin ' bonnie upo ' the entick -- shimmerin ' and brakin ' upo ' the water , as hit bracks upo ' the stanes afore it fa 's .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 28]: An ' what fa 's , it luiks as gin it took the licht wi ' ' t i ' the wame o ' ' t like .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 42]: it 's bonnie , woman ; and I wiss ye had the sicht o ' yer een to see ' t wi ' ; though ye do preten ' to think little o ' ` t. '' `` Weel , weel !
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 17]: my time 's comin ' , Thamas ; and I maun jist bide till it comes .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 9]: Ye canna help me , I see that .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 27]: Gin I could only open my een for ae minute , I wad ken a ' aboot it , and be able to answer mysel ' .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 18]: -- I think we 'll gang into the hoose , for I canna bide it langer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 30]: All the time they were talking Annie was watching Alec 's boat , which had dropped down the river , and was floating in the sunshine above the dam .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 25]: Thomas must have seen it too , for it was in the very heart of the radiance reflected to them from the watery mirror .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 29]: But Alec was a painful subject with Thomas , for when they chanced to meet now , nothing more than the passing salute of ordinary acquaintance was exchanged .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 12]: And Thomas was not able to be indulgent to young people .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 19]: Certain facts in his nature , as well as certain articles in his creed , rendered him unable .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 46]: So , being one of those who never speak of what is painful to them if they can avoid it -- thinking all the more , he talked about the light , and said nothing about the boat that was in the middle of it .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 28]: Had Alec been rowing , Tibbie would have heard the oars ; but he only paddled enough to keep the boat from drifting on to the dam .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 30]: Kate sat in the stern looking at the water with half-closed eyes , and Alec sat looking at Kate , as if his eyes were made only for her .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 35]: And Annie sat in the meadow , and she too looked at Kate ; and she thought how pretty she was , and how she must like being rowed about in the old boat .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 8]: It seemed quite an old boat now .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 12]: An age had passed since her name was painted on it .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 33]: She wondered if _ The Bonnie Annie _ was worn off the stern yet ; or if Alec had painted it out , and put the name of the pretty lady instead .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 17]: When Tibbie and Thomas walked away into the house , Annie lingered behind on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 56]: The sun sank slanting and slow , yet he did sink , lower and lower ; till at length Alec leaned back with a stronger pull on the oars , and the boat crept away up the stream , lessening as it crept , and , turning a curve in the river , was lost .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 50]: Still she sat on , with one hand lying listlessly in her lap , and the other plucking blades of grass and making a little heap of them beside her , till she had pulled a spot quite bare , and the brown earth peeped through between the roots .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 26]: Then she rose , went up to the door of the cottage , called a good night to Tibbie , and took her way home .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 3]: CHAPTER LII .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 61]: My story has not to do with city-life , in which occur frequent shocks , changes , and recombinations , but with the life of a country region ; and is , therefore , `` to a lingering motion bound , '' like the day , like the ripening of the harvest , like the growth of all good things .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 19]: But clouds and rainbows will come in the quietest skies ; adventures and coincidences in the quietest village .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 30]: As Kate and Alec walked along the street , on their way to the castle , one of the coaches from the county-town drove up with its four thorough-breds .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 10]: `` What a handsome fellow the driver is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 3]: said Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 7]: Alec looked up at the box .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 19]: There sat Beauchamp , with the ribbons in his grasp , handling his horses with composure and skill .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 17]: Beside him sat the owner of the coach , a _ laird _ of the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 7]: Certainly Beauchamp was a handsome fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 9]: But a sting went through Alec 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 17]: It was the first time that he thought of his own person in comparison with another .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 11]: That she should admire Beauchamp , though he was handsome !
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 44]: The memory even of that moment made him writhe on his bed years after ; for a mental and bodily wound are alike in this , that after there is but the scar of either left , bad weather will revive the torture .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 4]: His face fell .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 10]: Kate saw it , and did him some injustice .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 14]: They walked on in silence , in the shadow of a high wall .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 12]: Kate looked up at the top of the wall and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 5]: Alec looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 14]: Her face was as full of light as a diamond in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 6]: He forgot all his jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 16]: The fresh tide of his love swept it away , or at least covered it .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 38]: On the top of the wall , in the sun , grew one wild scarlet poppy , a delicate transparent glory , through which the sunlight shone , staining itself red , and almost dissolving the poppy .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 21]: The red light melted away the mist between them , and they walked in it up to the ruined walls .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 30]: Long grass grew about them , close to the very door , which was locked , that if old Time could not be kept out , younger destroyers might .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 32]: Other walls stood around , vitrified by fire -- the remnants of an older castle still , about which Jamblichus might have spied the lingering phantoms of many a terrible deed .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 25]: They entered by the door in the great tower , under the spiky remnants of the spiral stair projecting from the huge circular wall .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 61]: To the right , a steep descent , once a stair , led down to the cellars and the dungeon ; a terrible place , the visible negations of which are horrid , and need no popular legends such as Alec had been telling Kate , of a walled-up door and a lost room , to add to their influence .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 47]: It was no wonder that when he held out his hand to lead her down into the darkness and through winding ways to the mouth of the far-off beehive dungeon -- it was no wonder , I say , that she should shrink and draw back .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 39]: A few rays came through the decayed planks of the door which Alec had pushed to behind them , and fell upon the rubbish of centuries sloping in the brown light and damp air down into the abyss .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 32]: One larger ray from the keyhole fell upon Kate 's face , and showed it blanched with fear , and her eyes distended with the effort to see through the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 36]: At that moment , a sweet , low voice came from somewhere , out of the darkness , saying : `` Dinna be feared , mem , to gang whaur Alec wants ye to gang .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 12]: Ye can lippen -LRB- trust -RRB- to _ him _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 33]: Staring in the direction of the sound , Kate saw the pale face of a slender -- half child , half maiden , glimmering across the gulf that led to the dungeon .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 32]: She stood in the midst of a sepulchral light , whose faintness differed from mere obscuration , inasmuch as it told how bright it was out of doors in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 34]: Annie , I say , stood in this dimness -- a dusky and yet radiant creature , seeming to throw off from her a faint brown light -- a lovely , earth-stained ghost .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 7]: Annie , is that you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 3]: said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 12]: `` Ay is ` t , Alec , '' Annie answered .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 25]: `` This is an old schoolfellow of mine , '' he said , turning to Kate , who was looking haughtily at the girl .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 4]: is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 5]: said Kate , condescending .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 23]: Between the two , each looking ghostly to the other , lay a dark cavern-mouth that seemed to go down to Hades .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 9]: `` Wonna ye gang doon , mem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 3]: said Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 12]: `` No , thank you , '' answered Kate , decisively .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 14]: `` Alec 'll tak ' guid care o ' ye , mem . ''
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 12]: yes , I daresay ; but I had rather not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 4]: Alec said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 7]: Kate would not trust him then !
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 18]: He would not have thought much of it , however , but for what had passed before .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 12]: Would she have gone with Beauchamp if he had asked her ?
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 28]: if he had asked Annie , she too would have turned pale , but she would have laid her hand in his , and gone with him .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 24]: `` Gin ye want to gang up , than , '' she said , `` I 'll lat ye see the easiest road .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 8]: It 's roun ' this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 25]: And she pointed to a narrow ledge between the descent and the circular wall , by which they could cross to where she stood .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 31]: But Alec , who had no desire for Annie 's company , declined her guidance , and took Kate up a nearer though more difficult ascent to the higher level .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 22]: Here all the floors of the castle lay in dust beneath their feet , mingled with fragments of chimney-piece and battlement .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 10]: The whole central space lay open to the sky .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 10]: Annie remained standing on the edge of the dungeon-slope .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 23]: She had been on her way to see Tibbie , when she caught a glimpse of Kate and Alec as they passed .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 35]: Since watching them in the boat the evening before , she had been longing to speak to Alec , longing to see Kate nearer : perhaps the beautiful lady would let her love her .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 39]: She guessed where they were going , and across the fields she bounded like a fawn , straight as the crows flew home to the precincts of that `` ancient rest , '' and reached it before them .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 34]: She did not need to fetch the key , for she knew a hole on the level of the grass , wide enough to let her creep through the two yards of wall .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 12]: So she crept in and took her place near the door .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 39]: After they had rambled over the lower part of the building , Alec took Kate up a small winding stair , past a succession of empty doorways like eyeless sockets , leading nowhither because the floors had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 78]: Kate was so frightened by coming suddenly upon one after another of these defenceless openings , that by the time she reached the broad platform , which ran , all bare of parapet or battlement , around the top of the tower , she felt faint ; and when Alec scampered off like a goat to reach the bartizan at the other side , she sank in an agony of fear upon the landing of the stair .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 43]: Looking down upon her from the top of the little turret , Alec saw that she was ill , and returning instantly in great dismay , comforted her as well as he could , and got her by degrees to the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 43]: There was a spot of grass inside the walls , on which he made her rest ; and as the sun shone upon her through one of the ruined windows , he stood so that his shadow should fall across her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 10]: While he stood thus a strange fancy seized him .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 83]: The sun became in his eyes a fiery dragon , which having devoured half of the building , having eaten the inside out of it , having torn and gnawed it everywhere , and having at length reached its kernel , the sleeping beauty , whose bed had , in the long years , mouldered away , and been replaced by the living grass , would swallow her up anon , if he were not there to stand between and defend her .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 30]: When he looked at her next , she had indeed become the sleeping beauty he had fancied her ; and sleep had already restored the colour to her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 35]: Turning his eyes up to the tower from which they had just descended , he saw , looking down upon them from one of the isolated doorways , the pale face of Patrick Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 19]: Alec bounded to the stair , rushed to the top and round the platform , but found nobody .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 18]: Beginning to doubt his eyes , his next glance showed him Beauchamp standing over the sleeping girl .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 20]: He darted down the screw of the stair , but when he reached the bottom Beauchamp had again disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 8]: The same moment Kate began to wake .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 15]: Her first movement brought Alec to his senses : why should he follow Beauchamp ?
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 29]: He returned to her side , and they left the place , locked the door behind them , took the key to the lodge , and went home .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 48]: After tea , Alec , believing he had locked Beauchamp into the castle , returned and searched the building from top to bottom , even got a candle and a ladder , and went down into the dungeon , found no one , and went home bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 55]: While Alec was searching the vacant ruin , Beauchamp was comfortably seated on the box of the Spitfire , tooling it halfway home -- namely , as far as the house of its owner , the laird above mentioned , who was a relative of his mother , and whom he was then visiting .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 24]: He had seen Kate and Alec take the way to the castle , and had followed them , and found the door unlocked .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 14]: Watching them about the place , he ascended the stair from another approach .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 50]: The moment Alec looked up at him , he ran down again , and had just dropped into a sort of well-like place which the stair had used to fill on its way to a lower level , when he heard Alec 's feet thundering up over his head .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 95]: Determined then to see what the lady was like , for he had never seen her close , or without her bonnet , which now lay beside her on the grass , he scrambled out , and , approaching her cautiously , had a few moments to contemplate her before he saw -- for he kept a watch on the tower -- that Alec had again caught sight of him , when he immediately fled to his former refuge , which communicated with a low-pitched story lying between the open level and the vaults .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 15]: The sound of the ponderous and rusty bolt reached him across the cavernous space .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 13]: He had not expected their immediate departure , and was rather alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 17]: His first impulse was to try whether he could not shoot the bolt from the inside .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 8]: This he soon found to be impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 31]: He next turned to the windows in the front , but there the ground fell away so suddenly that he was many feet from it -- an altogether dangerous leap .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 24]: He was beginning to feel seriously concerned , when he heard a voice : `` Do ye want to win oot , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 7]: They hae lockit the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 8]: He turned but could see no one .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 25]: Approaching the door again , he spied Annie , in the dark twilight , standing on the edge of the descent to the vaults .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 18]: He had passed the spot not a minute before , and she was certainly not there then .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 26]: She looked as if she had just glided up that slope from a region so dark that a spectre might haunt it all day long .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 25]: But Beauchamp was not of a fanciful disposition , and instead of taking her for a spectre , he accosted her with easy insolence !
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 21]: `` Tell me how to get out , my pretty girl , and I 'll give you a kiss . ''
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 33]: Seized with a terror she did not understand , Annie darted into the cavern between them , and sped down its steep into the darkness which lay there like a lurking beast .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 20]: A few yards down , however , she turned aside , through a low doorway , into a vault .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 22]: Beauchamp rushed after her , passed her , and fell over a great stone lying in the middle of the way .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 37]: Annie heard him fall , sprung forth again , and , flying to the upper light , found her way out , and left the discourteous knight a safe captive , fallen upon that horrible stair .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 96]: -- A horrible stair it was : up and down those steps , then steep and worn , now massed into an incline of beaten earth , had swarmed , for months together , a multitude of naked children , orphaned and captive by the sword , to and from the troughs at which they fed like pigs , amidst the laughter of the lord of the castle and his guests ; while he who passed down them to the dungeon beyond , had little chance of ever retracing his steps upward to the light .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 30]: Annie told the keeper that there was a gentleman shut into the castle , and then ran a mile and a half to Tibbie 's cottage , without stopping .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 13]: But she did not say a word to Tibbie about her adventure .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIII .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 26]: A spirit of prophecy , whether from the Lord or not , was abroad this summer among the clergy of Glamerton , of all persuasions .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 11]: Nor was its influences confined to Glamerton or the clergy .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 9]: The neighbourhood and the laity had their share .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 32]: Those who read their Bibles , of whom there were many in that region , took to reading the prophecies , all the prophecies , and scarcely anything but the prophecies .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 38]: Upon these every man , either for himself or following in the track of his spiritual instructor , exercised his individual powers of interpretation , whose fecundity did not altogether depend upon the amount of historical knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 18]: But whatever was known , whether about ancient Assyria or modern Tahiti , found its theoretic place .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 56]: Of course the Church of Rome had her due share of the application from all parties ; but neither the Church of England , the Church of Scotland , nor either of the dissenting sects , went without its portion freely dealt , each of the last finding something that applied to all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 55]: There were some , however , who cared less for such modes , and , themselves given to a daily fight with antichrist in their own hearts , sought -- for they too read the prophecies -- to fix their reference on certain sins , and certain persons classed according to these their sins .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 56]: With a burning desire for the safety of their neighbours , they took upon them the strongest words of rebuke and condemnation , so that one might have thought they were revelling in the idea of the vengeance at hand , instead of striving for the rescue of their neighbours from the wrath to come .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 12]: Among these were Thomas Crann and his minister , Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 14]: To them Glamerton was the centre of creation , providence , and revelation .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 27]: Every warning finger in The Book pointed to it ; every burst of indignation from the labouring bosom of holy prophet was addressed to its sinners .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 91]: And what the ministers spoke to classes from the pulpit , Thomas , whose mode of teaching was in so far Socratic that he singled out his man , applied to the individual -- in language occasionally too much to the point to admit of repetition in the delicate ears of the readers of the nineteenth century , some of whom are on such friendly terms with the vices themselves , that they are shocked at the vulgarity and rudeness of the _ names _ given them by their forefathers .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 15]: `` Ye ken weel eneuch that ye 're a drucken vratch , Peter Peterson .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 19]: An ' ye ken weel eneuch that ye 're nane better , forbye , than ye sud be .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 25]: Naebody ever accused ye o ' stealin ' ; but gin ye haud on as ye 're doin ' , that 'll come neist .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 42]: But I doobt the wrath o ' the Almichty 'll be doon upo ' 's like a spate , as it was i ' the days o ' Noah , afore ye hae time to learn to steal , Peter Peterson .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 23]: Ye 'll hae _ your _ share in bringin ' destruction upo ' this toon , and a ' its belongin 's .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 21]: The verra kirk-yard winna hide ye that day frae the wrath o ' Him that sitteth upo ' the throne .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 20]: Tak ' ye tent , and repent , Peter ; or it 'll be the waur for ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 63]: The object of this terrible denunciation of the wrath of the Almighty was a wretched little object indeed , just like a white rabbit -- with pink eyes , a grey face and head , poor thin legs , a long tail-coat that came nearly to his heels , an awfully ragged pair of trowsers , and a liver charred with whisky .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 49]: He had kept a whisky-shop till he had drunk all his own whisky ; and as no distiller would let him have any on trust , he now hung about the inn-yard , and got a penny from one , and twopence from another , for running errands .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 19]: -- Had they been sovereigns they would all have gone the same way -- namely , for whisky .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 23]: He listened to Thomas with a kind of dazed meekness , his eyes wandering everywhere except in the direction of Thomas 's .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 20]: One who did not know Thomas would have thought it cowardly in him to attack such a poor creature .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 15]: But Thomas was just as ready to fly at the greatest man in Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 18]: All the evildoers of the place feared him -- the rich manufacturer and the strong horse-doctor included .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 21]: They called him a wheezing , canting hypocrite , and would go streets out of their way to avoid him .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 12]: But on the present occasion he went too far with Peter .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 137]: `` And it 's weel kent your dochter Bauby 's no better nor she sud be ; for -- '' Peter 's face flushed crimson , though where the blood could have come from was an anatomical mystery ; he held up his hands with the fingers crooked like the claws of an animal , for the poor creature had no notion of striking ; and , dancing backwards and forwards from one foot to the other , and grinning with set teeth in an agony of impotent rage , cried out : `` Tam Crann , gin ye daur to say anither word against my Bauby wi ' that foul mou ' o ' yours , I 'll -- I 'll -- I 'll -- worry ye like a mad dog ye ill-tongued scoonrel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 21]: His Bawby had already had two children -- one to the rich manufacturer , the other to the strong horse-doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 11]: Thomas turned in silence and went away rebuked and ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 29]: Next day he sent Peter a pair of old corduroy trowsers , into either leg of which he might have been buttoned like one of Paddy 's twins .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 16]: In the midst of this commotion of mind and speech , good Mr Cowie died .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 19]: He had taken no particular interest in what was going on , nor even in the prophecies themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 36]: Ever since Annie 's petition for counsel , he had been thinking , as he had never thought before , about his own relation to God ; and had found this enough without the prophecies .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 10]: Now he had carried his thoughts into another world .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 45]: While Thomas Crann was bending his spiritual artillery upon the poor crazy tub in which floated the earthly presence of Peter Peterson , Mr Cowie 's bark was lying stranded upon that shore whither the tide of time is slowly drifting each of us .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 11]: He was gently regretted by all -- even by Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 3]: ay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 24]: he said , with slow emphasis , ` long drawn out ' ; `` he 's gane , is he , honest man ?
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 24]: Weel , maybe he had the root o ' the maitter in him , although it made unco little show aboon the yird .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 9]: There was sma ' flower and less fruit .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 15]: But jeedgment disna belang to us , ye see , Jean , lass . ''
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 24]: Thomas would judge the living from morning to night ; but the dead -- he would leave them alone in the better hands .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 66]: `` I 'm thinkin ' , '' he added , `` he 's been taen awa ' frae the evil to come -- frae seein ' the terrible consequences o ' sic a saft way o ' dealin ' wi ' eternal trowth and wi ' perishin ' men -- taen awa ' like Eli , whan he brak his neck at the ill news .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 33]: For the fire and brimstane that overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha , is , I doobt , hingin ' ower this toon , ready to fa ' and smore us a ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 3]: `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 2]: hoot !
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 20]: dinna speyk sic awfu ' words , Thamas , Ye 're nae the prophet Jonah , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 17]: `` Are ye the whaul than , to swallow me and my words thegither , Jean ?
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 47]: I tell ye the wrath o ' God _ maun _ be roused against this toon , for it 's been growin ' waur and waur for mony a year ; till the verra lasses are no to be lippent oot them-lanes -LRB- alone -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 10]: `` What ken ye aboot the lasses , Thamas ?
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 6]: Haud ye to the men .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 10]: The lasses are nae waur nor in ither pairts .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 13]: I wat I can come and gang whan and whaur I like .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 10]: Never a body says a word to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 32]: This was true but hardly significant ; seeing Jean had one shoulder and one eye twice the size of the others , to say nothing of various obliquities and their compensations .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 22]: But , rude as Thomas was , he was gentleman enough to confine his reply to a snort and a silence .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 25]: For had he not chosen his housekeeper upon the strength of those personal recommendations of the defensive importance of which she was herself unaware ?
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 22]: Except his own daughters there was no one who mourned so deeply for the loss of Mr Cowie as Annie Anderson .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 88]: She had left his church and gone to the missionars , and there found more spiritual nourishment than Mr Cowie 's sermons could supply , but she could not forget his kisses , or his gentle words , or his shilling , for by their means , although she did not know it , Mr Cowie 's self had given her a more confiding notion of God , a better feeling of his tenderness , than she could have had from all Mr Turnbull 's sermons together .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 8]: What equal gift could a man give ?
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 9]: Was it not worth bookfuls of sound doctrine ?
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 50]: Yet the good man , not knowing this , had often looked back to that interview , and reproached himself bitterly that he , so long a clergyman of that parish , had no help to give the only child who ever came to him to ask such help .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 35]: So , when he lay on his death-bed , he sent for Annie , the only soul , out of all his pariah , over which he felt that he had any pastoral cure .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 23]: When , with pale , tearful face , she entered his chamber , she found him supported with pillows in his bed .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 20]: He stretched out his arms to her feebly , but held her close to his bosom , and wept .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 13]: `` I 'm going to die , Annie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 32]: `` And go to heaven , sir , to the face o ' God , '' said Annie , not sobbing , but with the tears streaming silently down her face .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 8]: `` I do n't know , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 20]: I 've been of no use ; and I 'm afraid God does not care much for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 22]: `` If God loves you half as much as I do , sir , ye 'll be well off in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 13]: And I 'm thinkin ' he maun love ye mair nor me .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 14]: For , ye see , sir , God 's love itsel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 8]: `` I do n't know , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 38]: But if ever I win there , which 'll be more than I deserve , I 'll tell him about you , and ask him to give you the help that I could n't give you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 8]: Love and Death make us all children .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 14]: -- Can Old Age be an evil thing , which does the same ?
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 21]: The old clergyman had thought himself a good Protestant at least , but even his Protestantism was in danger now .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 8]: Happily Protestantism was nothing to him now .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 7]: Nothing but God would do now .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 11]: Annie had no answer but what lay in her tears .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 12]: He called his daughter , who stood weeping in the room .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 4]: She came near .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 13]: `` Bring my study Bible , '' he said to her feebly .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 11]: She went and brought it -- a large quarto Bible .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 29]: `` Here , Annie , '' said the dying man , `` here 's my Bible that I 've made but ower little use o ' mysel ' .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 28]: Promise me , if ever ye have a house o ' your own , that ye 'll read out o ' that book every day at worship .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 22]: I want you not to forget me , as , if all 's well , I shall never forget you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 14]: `` That _ will _ I , sir , '' responded Annie earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 13]: `` And ye 'll find a new five-pound note between the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 8]: Take it , for my sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 2]: Money !
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 4]: Ah , well !
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 7]: Love can turn gold into grace .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 19]: `` Yes , sir , '' answered Annie , feeling this was no time for objecting to anything .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 6]: `` And good-bye , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 7]: I ca n't speak more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 15]: He drew her to him again , and kissed her for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 23]: Then he turned his face to the wall , and Annie went home weeping , with the great Bible in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 12]: In the inadvertence of grief , she ran into the shop .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 10]: `` What hae ye gotten there , lassie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 13]: said Bruce , as sharply as if she might have stolen it .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 27]: `` Mr Cowie gave me his Bible , 'cause he 's dein ' himsel ' , and doesna want it ony langer , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 8]: `` Lat 's luik at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 7]: Annie gave it up with reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 22]: `` It 's a braw buik , and bonnie buirds -- though gowd an ' purple maitters little to the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 34]: We 'll jist lay ' t upo ' the room-table , an ' we 'll hae worship oot o ' ' t whan ony body 's wi ' 's , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 40]: `` I want it mysel ' , '' objected Annie , in dismay , for although she did not think of the money at the moment , she had better reasons for not liking to part with the book .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 11]: `` Ye can hae ' t when ye want it .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 7]: That 's eneuch , surely . ''
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 50]: Annie could hardly think his saying so enough , however , seeing the door of _ the room _ was kept locked , and Mrs Bruce , patient woman as she was , would have boxed any one 's ears whom she met coming from within the sacred precincts .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIV .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 24]: Before the next Sunday Mr Cowie was dead ; and , through some mistake or mismanagement , there was no one to preach .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 29]: So the congregation did each as seemed right in his own eyes ; and Mrs Forbes went to the missionar kirk in the evening to hear Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 6]: Kate and Alec accompanied her .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 48]: By this time Robert Bruce had become a great man in the community -- after his own judgment at least ; for although , with a few exceptions , the missionars yielded him the influence he sought , nobody respected him ; they only respected his money .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 63]: He had managed to secure one of the most fashionable pews in the chapel ; and now when Mrs Forbes 's party entered , and a little commotion arose in consequence , they being more of gentlefolk than the place was accustomed to entertain , Bruce was the first to walk from his seat , and request them to occupy his pew .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 25]: Alec would have passed on , for he disliked the man , but Mrs Forbes having reasons for being complaisant , accepted his offer .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 21]: Colds kept the rest of the Bruces at home , and Annie was the only other occupant of the pew .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 26]: She crept up to the top of it , like a little shy mouse , to be as far out of the way as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 15]: `` Come oot , Annie , '' said Bruce , in a loud whisper .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 33]: Annie came out , with a warm flush over her pale face , and Mrs Forbes entered , then Kate , and last of all , Alec , much against his will .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 15]: Then Annie re-entered , and Bruce resumed his place as Cerberus of the pew-door .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 44]: So Annie was seated next to Alec , as she had never been , in church or chapel , or even in school , before , except on that memorable day when they were both _ kept in _ for the Shorter Catechism .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 21]: But Annie had no feeling of delight and awe like that with which Alec sat close to his beautiful cousin .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 19]: She had a feeling of pleasure , no doubt , but the essence of the pleasure was faith .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 15]: She trusted him and believed in him as much as she had ever done .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 16]: In the end , those who trust most will find they are nearest the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 11]: But Annie had no philosophy , either worldly or divine .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 11]: She had only common sense , gentleness , and faithfulness .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 43]: She was very glad , though , that Alec had come to hear Mr Turnbull , who knew the right way better than anybody else , and could show it quite as well as Evangelist in the _ Pilgrim 's Progress _ .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 24]: Nor was she far wrong in her judgment of the height of Mr Turnbull 's star , calculated from the horizon of Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 41]: He was a good man who ventured to think for himself -- as far as that may be possible for one upon whose spirit have converged , even before he was born , the influences of a thousand theological ancestors .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 40]: After reading the curses on Mount Ebal , he preached an eloquent sermon from the text : `` Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way ; yet saidst thou not ` there is no hope . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 84]: He showed his hearers that they had all been seeking satisfaction in their own pursuits , in the pride of their own way ; that they had been disappointed , even to weariness ; and that yet , such was their perversity , they would not acknowledge the hopelessness of the pursuit , and turn to that God who was ready to pardon , and in whose courts a day would give them more delight than a thousand in the tents of wickedness .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 63]: And opening his peroration by presumptuously appropriating the words of the Saviour , `` Verily , verily , I say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha , in that day , than for you , '' the preacher concluded with a terrible denunciation of wrath upon the sinners who had been called and would not come .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 12]: `` Woe unto you , for ye would not be warned !
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 20]: Woe unto you , for ye knew your Lord 's will , and yet committed things worthy of stripes !
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 9]: Therefore your whip shall be one of scorpions !
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 4]: Woe unto you !
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 98]: I say ; for , when the bridegroom cometh , ye shall knock in vain at the closed door ; ye shall stand without , and listen for a brief moment to the music and dancing within -- listen with longing hearts , till the rush of coming wings overpowers the blissful sounds , and the angels of vengeance sweep upon you , and bearing you afar through waste regions , cast you into outer darkness , where shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth , to the endless ages of a divine eternity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 62]: With these words the preacher burst into impassioned prayer for the souls which he saw exposed to a hell of which he himself knew not the horrors , else he dared not have preached it ; a hell the smoke of whose torments would arise and choke the elect themselves about the throne of God -- the hell of Exhausted Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 22]: As long as the stream of eloquence flowed the eyes of the congregation were fixed upon the preacher in breathless silence .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 15]: When it ceased they sank , and a sigh of exhaustion and relief arose .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 59]: In that ugly building , amidst that weary praying and inharmonious singing , with that blatant tone , and , worse than all , that merciless doctrine , there was yet _ preaching _ -- that rare speech of a man to his fellow-men whereby in their inmost hearts they know that he in his inmost heart believes .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 20]: There was hardly an indifferent countenance in all that wide space beneath , in all those far-sloping galleries above .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 10]: Every conscience hung out the red or pale flag .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 33]: When Alec ventured to look up , as he sat down after the prayer , he saw the eyes of Thomas Crann , far away in the crowd , fixed on him .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 14]: And he felt their force , though not in the way Thomas intended .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 38]: Thomas never meant to dart _ personal _ reproaches across the house of God ; but Alec 's conscience told him nevertheless , stung by that glance , that he had behaved ill to his old friend .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 58]: Nor did this lessen the general feeling which the sermon had awakened in his mind , un-self-conscious as it was , that something ought to be done ; that something was wrong in him somewhere ; that it ought to be set right somehow -- a feeling which every one in the pew shared , except one .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 50]: His heart was so moth-eaten and rusty , with the moths and the rust which Mammon brings with him when he comes in to abide with a man , that there was not enough of it left to make the terrible discovery that the rest of it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 13]: Its owner did not know that there was anything amiss with it .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 13]: What power can empty , sweep , and garnish such a heart ?
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 20]: Or what seven devils entering in , can make the last state of that man worse than the first ?
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 32]: A special prayer-meeting having been appointed , to be held after the sermon , Robert Bruce remained , to join in the intercession for the wicked town and its wicked neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 28]: He even `` engaged in prayer , '' for the first time in public , and astonished some of the older members by his gift in devotion .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 39]: He had been received into the church only a week or two before , upon profession of faith in the merits of Christ , not in Christ himself -- that would not have been definite enough for them .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 24]: But it would have been all the same to Robert Bruce , for he was ready to believe that he believed anything advantageous .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 32]: There had been one or two murmurs against his reception , and he had been several times visited and talked with , before the Church was satisfied as to his conversion .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 104]: But nothing was known against him beyond the fact that `` he luikit at baith sides o ' a bawbee ; '' and having learned many of their idioms , he had succeeded in persuading his examiners , and had possibly persuaded himself at the same time , that he had passed through all the phases of conversion , including conviction , repentance , and final acceptance of offered mercy on the terms proposed , and was now undergoing the slow and troublesome process of sanctification ; in corroboration of which he went on to produce talk , and coppers at the chapel-door .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 41]: Good people as many of those were who thus admitted him to their communion , in the full belief that none but conscious Christians should enjoy that privilege , his reputation for wealth had yet something to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 49]: Probably they thought that if the gospel proved mighty in this new disciple , more of his money might be accessible by and by for good purposes : amongst the rest , for sending missionaries to the heathen , teaching them to divorce their wives and wear trowsers .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 19]: And now he had been asked to pray , and had prayed with much propriety and considerable unction .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 36]: To be sure Tibbie Dyster did sniff a good deal during the performance ; but then that was a way she had of relieving her feelings , next best to that of speaking her mind .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 27]: When the meeting was over , Robert Bruce , Thomas Crann , and James Johnstone , who was one of the deacons , walked away together .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 32]: Very little conversation took place between them , for no subject but a religious one was admissible ; and the religious feelings of those who had any were pretty nearly exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 12]: Bruce 's , however , were not in the least exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 49]: On the contrary , he was so pleased to find that he could pray as well as any of them , and the excitement of doing so before judges had been so new and pleasant to him , that he thought he should like to try it again .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 16]: He thought , too , of the grand Bible lying up there on the room-table .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 46]: `` Come in , sirs , '' he said , as they approached his door , `` and tak ' a pairt in our faimily worship ; and sae the day 'll gang oot wi ' prayer , as it cam in wi ' prayer .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 45]: And the Lord 'll maybe hae mercy upo ' 's , and no destroy the place , shops an ' a ' , for the sins o ' the inhaibitants -- them ` at sees , for them ` at 's blin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 18]: Neither of his companions felt much inclined to accede to his request : they both yielded notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 29]: He conducted them up-stairs , unlocked the musty room , pulled up the blinds , and admitted enough of lingering light for the concluding devotions of the day .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 15]: He then proceeded to gather his family together , calling them one by one .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 4]: `` Mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 14]: he cried , from the top of the stair , meaning his wife .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 10]: `` Tea , father , '' answered Mrs Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 5]: `` Come to worship .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 4]: -- Robert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 6]: `` Ay , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 5]: `` Come to worship .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 4]: -- Johnnie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 20]: And so he went through the family roll-call , as if it were a part of some strange liturgy .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 48]: When all had entered and seated themselves , the head of the house went slowly to the side-table , took from it reverentially the late minister 's study Bible , sat down by the window , laid the book on his knees , and solemnly opened it .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 45]: Now a five-pound note is not thick enough to make a big Bible open between the pages where it is laid ; but the note might very well have been laid in at a place where the Bible was in the habit of opening .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 37]: `` Without an instant 's hesitation , Robert slipped it away , and crumpling it up in his hand , gave out the twenty-third psalm , over which it had lain , and read it through .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 109]: Finding it too short , however , for the respectability of worship , he went on with the twenty-fourth , turning the leaf with thumb and forefinger , while the rest of the fingers clasped the note tight in his palm , and reading as he turned , `` He that hath clean hands and a pure heart -- '' As soon as he had finished this psalm , he closed the book with a snap ; feeling which to have been improper , he put an additional compensating solemnity into the tone in which he said : `` Thomas Crann , will you engage in prayer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 10]: `` Pray yersel ' , '' answered Thomas gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 13]: Whereupon Robert rose , and , kneeling down , did pray himself .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 20]: But Thomas , instead of leaning forward on his chair when he knelt , glanced sharply round at Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 53]: He had seen him take something from the Bible , and crumple it up in his hand but would not have felt any inclination to speculate about it , had it not been for the peculiarly keen expression of eager surprise and happy greed which came over his face in the act .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 42]: Having seen that , and being always more or less suspicious of Bruce , he wanted to know more ; and was thus led into an action of which he would not have believed it possible he should ever be guilty .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 30]: He saw Bruce take advantage of the posture of devotion which he had assumed , to put something into his pocket unseen of his guests , as he believed .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 15]: When worship was over , Bruce did not ask them to slay to supper .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 9]: Prayers did not involve expense ; supper did .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 10]: But Thomas at least could not have stayed longer .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 9]: He left his friends and went home pondering .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 19]: The devotions of the day were not to be concluded for him with any social act of worship .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 17]: He had many anxious prayers yet to offer before his heart would be quiet in sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 36]: Especially there was Alec to be prayed for , and his dawtie , Annie ; and in truth the whole town of Glamerton , and the surrounding parishes -- and Scotland , and the world .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 75]: Indeed sometimes Thomas went further , and although it is not reported of him that he ever prayed for the devil , as that worthiest of Scotch clergymen prayed , he yet did something very like it once or twice , when he prayed for `` the haill universe o ' God , an ' a ' the bein 's i n't , up and doon , that we ken unco little about . ''
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 3]: CHAPTER LV .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 34]: The next morning Kate and Alec rose early , to walk before breakfast to the top of one of the hills , through a young larch-wood which covered it from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 14]: The morning was cool , and the sun exultant as a good child .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 17]: The dew-diamonds were flashing everywhere , none the less lovely that they were fresh-made that morning .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 27]: The lark 's song was a cantata with the sun and the wind and the larch-odours , in short , the whole morning for the words .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 8]: How the larks did sing that morning !
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 22]: The only clouds were long pale delicate streaks of lovely gradations in gray ; here mottled , there swept into curves .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 54]: It was just the morning to rouse a wild longing for motion , for the sea and its shore , for endless travel through an endless region of grace and favour , the sun rising no higher , the dew lingering on every blade , and the lark never wearying for his nest .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 18]: Kate longed for some infinitude of change without vicissitude -- ceaseless progress towards a goal endlessly removed !
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 29]: She did not know that the door into that life might have been easier to find in that ugly chapel than even here in the vestibule of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 19]: `` My nurse used to call the lark ` Our Lady 's hen , ' '' said Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 5]: `` How pretty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 10]: answered Alec , and had no more to say .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 12]: `` Are the people of Glamerton very wicked , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 11]: asked Kate , making another attempt to rouse a conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 13]: `` I 'm sure I do n't know , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 12]: `` I suppose they 're no worse than other people . ''
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 18]: `` I thought from Mr Turnbull 's sermon that they must be a great deal worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 17]: they all preach like that -- except good Mr Cowie , and he 's dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 14]: `` Do you think he knew better than the rest of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 7]: `` I do n't know that .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 13]: But the missionars do know something that other people do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 14]: And that Mr Turnbull always speaks as if he were in earnest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 7]: `` Yes , he does . ''
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 9]: `` But there 's that fellow Bruce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 14]: `` Do you mean the man that put us into his seat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 16]: I _ ca n't _ think what makes my mother so civil to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 8]: `` Why should n't she be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 12]: `` Well , you see -- I ca n't bear him .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 8]: And I ca n't understand my mother .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 7]: It 's not like her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 19]: In a moment more they were in a gentle twilight of green , flashed with streaks of gold .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 29]: A forest of delicate young larches crowded them in , their rich brown cones hanging like the knops that looped up their dark garments fringed with paler green .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 4]: And the scent !
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 15]: What a thing to _ invent _ -- the smell of a larch wood !
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 18]: It is the essence of the earth-odour , distilled in the thousand-fold alembics of those feathery trees .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 22]: And the light winds that awoke blew murmurous music , so sharply and sweetly did that keen foliage divide the air .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 25]: Having gazed their fill on the morning around them , they returned to breakfast , and after breakfast they went down to the river .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 23]: They stood on the bank , over one of the deepest pools , in the bottom of which the pebbles glimmered brown .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 15]: Kate gazed into it abstracted , fascinated , swinging her neckerchief in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 6]: Something fell into the water .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 9]: she cried , `` what shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 7]: It was my mother 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 15]: The words were scarcely out of her mouth when Alec was in the water .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 8]: Bubbles rose and broke as he vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 19]: Kate did not scream , but stood , pale , with parted lips , staring into the pool .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 18]: With a boiling and heaving of the water , he rose triumphant , holding up the brooch .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 11]: Kate gave a cry and threw herself on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 16]: When Alec reached her , she lay sobbing , and would not lift her head .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 17]: `` You are very unkind , Alec , '' she said at last , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 8]: `` What will your mother say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 11]: And she hid her face and began to sob afresh .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 12]: `` It was your mother 's brooch , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 15]: `` Yes , yes ; but we could have got it out somehow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 5]: `` No other how .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 10]: -- I would have done that for any girl .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 16]: You do n't know what I would do for _ you _ , Kate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 8]: `` You should n't have frightened me .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 27]: I had been thinking how greedy the pool looked , '' said Kate , rising now , as if she dared not remain longer beside it .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 11]: `` I did n't mean to frighten you , Kate .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 6]: I never thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 7]: I am almost a water-rat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 11]: `` And now you 'll get your death of cold .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 4]: Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 3]: Alec laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 9]: He was in no hurry to go home .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 12]: But she seized his hand and half-dragged him all the way .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 10]: He had never been so happy in his life .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 11]: Kate had cried because he had jumped into the water !
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 10]: That night they had a walk in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 65]: It was all moon -- the air with the mooncore in it ; the trees confused into each other by the sleep of her light ; the bits of water , so many moons over again ; the flowers , all pale phantoms of flowers : the whole earth , transfused with reflex light , was changed into a moon-ghost of its former self .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 7]: They were walking in the moon-world .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 19]: The silence and the dimness sank into Alec 's soul , and it became silent and dim too .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 22]: The only sound was the noise of the river , quenched in that light to the sleepy hush of moon-haunted streams .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 9]: Kate felt that she had more room now .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 19]: And yet the scope of her vision was less , for the dusk had closed in around her .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 30]: She had ampler room because the Material had retired as behind a veil , leaving the Immaterial less burdened , and the imagination more free to work its will .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 21]: The Spiritual is ever putting on material garments ; but in the moonlight , the Material puts on spiritual garments .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 19]: Kate sat down at the foot of an old tree which stood alone in one of the fields .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 29]: Alec threw himself on the grass , and looked up in her face , which was the spirit-moon shining into his world , and drowning it in dreams .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 12]: -- The Arabs always call their beautiful women _ moons _ .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 16]: -- Kate sat as silent as the moon in heaven , which rained down silence .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 18]: And Alec lay gazing at Kate , till silence gave birth to speech : `` Oh Kate !
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 6]: How I love you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 3]: Kate started .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 4]: She was frightened .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 9]: Her mind had been full of gentle thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 13]: Yet she laid her hand on his arm and accepted the love .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 4]: -- But how ?
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 6]: `` You dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 12]: Perhaps Kate 's answer was the best she could have given .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 17]: But it stung Alec to the heart , and they went home in a changed silence .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 17]: -- The resolution she came to upon the way was not so good as her answer .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 7]: She did not love Alec so .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 14]: He could not understand her ; she could not look up to him .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 14]: But he was only a boy , and therefore would not suffer much .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 14]: He would forget her as soon as she was out of his sight .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 28]: So as he was a very dear boy , she would be as kind to him as ever she could , for she was going away soon .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 29]: She did not see that Alec would either take what she gave for more than she gave , or else turn from it as no gift at all .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 18]: When they reached the house , Alec , recovering himself a little , requested her to sing .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 15]: She complied at once , and was foolish enough to sing the following BALLAD .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 16]: It is May , and the moon leans down all night Over a blossomy land .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 15]: By her window sits the lady white , With her chin upon her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 31]: `` O sing to me , dear nightingale , The song of a year ago ; I have had enough of longing and wail , Enough of heart-break and woe .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 28]: O glimmer on me , my apple-tree , Like living flakes of snow ; Let odour and moonlight and melody In the old rich harmony flow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 18]: The dull odours stream ; the cold blossoms gleam ; And the bird will not be glad .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 16]: The dead never speak when the living dream -- They are too weak and sad .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 16]: She listened and sate , till night grew late , Bound by a weary spell .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 15]: Then a face came in at the garden-gate , And a wondrous thing befell .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 22]: Up rose the joy as well as the love , In the song , in the scent , in the show !
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 15]: The moon grew glad in the sky above , The blossom grew rosy below .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 17]: The blossom and moon , the scent and the tune , In ecstasy rise and fall .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 17]: But they had no thanks for the granted boon , For the lady forgot them all .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 14]: There was no light in the room except that of the shining air .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 14]: Alec sat listening , as if Kate were making and meaning the song .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 51]: But notwithstanding the enchantment of the night , all rosy in the red glow of Alec 's heart ; notwithstanding that scent of gilly-flowers and sweet-peas stealing like love through every open door and window ; notwithstanding the radiance of her own beauty , Kate was only singing a song .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 59]: It is sad to have all the love and all the mystery to oneself -- the other being the centre of the glory , and yet far beyond its outmost ring , sitting on a music-stool at a common piano old-fashioned and jingling , not in fairyland at all in fact , or even believing in its presence .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 20]: But that night the moon was in a very genial humour , and gave her light plentiful and golden .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 15]: She would even dazzle a little , if one looked at her too hard .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 33]: Sho could not dazzle Tibbie though , who was seated with Annie on the pale green grass , with the moon about them in the air and beneath them in the water .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 13]: `` Ye say it 's a fine munelicht nicht , Annie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 9]: `` Ay , ` deed is ` t .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 10]: As bonnie a nicht as ever I saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 21]: `` Weel , it jist passes my comprehension -- hoo ye can see , whan the air 's like this .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 50]: I ' the winter ye canna see , for it 's aye cauld whan the sun 's awa ; and though it 's no cauld the nicht , I fin ' that there 's no licht i ' the air -- there 's a differ ; it 's deid-like .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 36]: But the soun ' o ' the water 's a ' the same , and the smell o ' some o ' the flowers is bonnier i ' the nicht nor i ' the day .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 7]: That 's a ' verra weel .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 21]: But hoo ye can see whan the sun 's awa , I say again , jist passes my comprehension . ''
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 12]: `` It 's the mune , ye ken , Tibbie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 8]: `` Weel , what 's the mune ?
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 7]: I dinna fin ' ` t .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 9]: It mak 's no impress upo ' me .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 15]: -- Ye _ canna _ see sae weel 's ye say , lass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 15]: exclaimed Tibbie , at length , in a triumph of incredulity and self assertion .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 27]: `` Weel , gin ye winna believe me o ' yer ain free will , Tibbie , I maun jist gar ye , '' said Annie .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 18]: And she rose , and running into the cottage , fetched from it a small pocket Bible .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 17]: `` Noo , ye jist hearken , Tibbie , '' she said , as she returned .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 25]: And , opening the Bible , she read one of Tibbie 's favourite chapters , rather slowly no doubt , but with perfect correctness .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 33]: `` Weel , lassie , I canna mak heid or tail o ' ` t. '' `` I 'll tell ye , Tibbie , what the mune aye minds me o ' .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 26]: The face o ' God 's like the sun , as ye hae tellt me ; for no man cud see him and live . ''
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 26]: `` That 's no sayin ' , ye ken , '' interposed Tibbie , `` that we canna see him efter we 're deid . ''
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 37]: `` But the mune , '' continued Annie , disregarding Tibbie 's interruption , `` maun be like the face o ' Christ , for it gies licht and ye can luik at it notwithstandin ' .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 31]: The mune 's jist like the sun wi ' the ower-muckle taen oot o ' ` t. Or like Moses wi ' the veil ower 's face , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 14]: The fowk cudna luik at him till he pat the veil on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 26]: `` Na , na , lass ; that winna do ; for ye ken his coontenance was as the sun shineth in his strenth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 13]: `` Ay , but that was efter the resurrection , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 56]: I 'm thinkin ' there had been a kin ' o ' a veil ower his face a ' the time he was upo ' the earth ; and syne whan he gaed whaur there war only heavenly een to luik at him , een that could bide it , he took it aff . ''
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 7]: `` Weel , I wadna wonner .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 5]: Maybe ye 're richt .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 14]: And gin ye _ be _ richt , that accounts for the Transfiguration .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 28]: He jist lifted the veil aff o ' 'm a wee , and the glory aneath it lap oot wi ' a leme like the lichtnin ' .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 4]: But that munelicht !
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 27]: I can mak naething o ' ` t. '' `` Weel , Tibbie , I canna mak you oot ony mair nor ye can the munelicht .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 25]: Whiles ye appear to ken a ' thing aboot the licht , an ' ither whiles ye 're clean i ' the dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 9]: `` Never ye min ' me , lass .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 11]: I s ' be i ' the licht some day .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 10]: Noo we 'll gang in to the hoose . ''
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVI .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 18]: Murdoch Malison , the schoolmaster , was appointed to preach in the parish church the following Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 16]: He had never preached there , for he had been no favourite with Mr Cowie .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 32]: Now , however , that the good man was out of the way , they gave him a chance , and he caught at it , though not without some misgivings .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 25]: In the school-desk , `` he was like a maister or a pope ; '' but the pulpit -- how would he fill that ?
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 99]: Two resolutions he came to ; the first that he would not read his sermon , but _ commit _ it and deliver it as like the extempore utterance of which he was incapable as might be -- a piece of falsehood entirely understood , and justified by Scotch custom ; the second , to take rather more than a hint from the fashion of preaching now so much in favour amongst the seceders and missionars : he would be a _ Jupiter tonans _ , wielding the forked lightnings of the law against the sins of Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 41]: So , on the appointed day , having put on a new suit of black , and the gown over it , he ascended the pulpit stairs , and , conscious of a strange timidity , gave out the psalm .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 46]: He cast one furtive glance around , as he took his seat for the singing , and saw a number of former as well as present pupils gathered to hear him , amongst whom were the two Truffeys , with their grandfather seated between them .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 21]: He got through the prayer very well , for he was accustomed to that kind of thing in the school .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 33]: But when he came to the sermon , he found that to hear boys repeat their lessons and punish them for failure , did not necessarily stimulate the master 's own memory .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 19]: He gave out his text : The Book of the Prophet Joel , first chapter , fourth verse .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 6]: Joel , first and fourth .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 40]: `` That which the palmer-worm hath left , hath the locust eaten ; and that which the locust hath left , hath the canker-worm eaten ; and that which the canker-worm hath left , hath the caterpillar eaten . ''
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 19]: Now if he could have read his sermon , it would have shown itself a most creditable invention .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 65]: It had a general introduction upon the temporal punishment of sin ; one head entitled , `` The completeness of the infliction ; '' and another , `` The punishment of which this is the type ; '' the latter showing that those little creeping things were not to be compared to the great creeping thing , namely , the worm that never dies .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 66]: These two heads had a number of horns called _ particulars _ ; and a tail called an _ application _ , in which the sins of his hearers were duly chastised , with vague and awful threats of some vengeance not confined to the life to come , but ready to take present form in such a judgment as that described in the text .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 10]: But he had resolved not to read his sermon .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 47]: So he began to repeat it , with sweeps of the hands , pointings of the fingers , and other such tricks of second-rate actors , to aid the self-delusion of his hearers that it was a genuine present outburst from the soul of Murdoch Malison .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 22]: For they all knew as well as he did , that his sermon was only `` cauld kail het again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 31]: But some family dishes -- Irish stew , for example , or Scotch broth -- may be better the second day than the first ; and where was the harm ?
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 18]: All concerned would have been perfectly content , if he had only gone on as he began .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 39]: But , as he approached the second head , the fear suddenly flashed through his own that he would not be able to recall it ; and that moment all the future of his sermon was a blank .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 17]: He stammered , stared , did nothing , thought nothing -- only felt himself in hell .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 61]: Roused by the sight of the faces of his hearers growing suddenly expectant at the very moment when he had nothing more to give them , he gathered his seven fragmentary wits , and as a last resort , to which he had had a vague regard in putting his manuscript in his pocket , resolved to read the remainder .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 44]: But in order to give the change of mode an appearance of the natural and suitable , he managed with a struggle to bring out the words : `` But , my brethren , let us betake ourselves to the written testimony . ''
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 33]: Every one concluded he was going to quote from Scripture ; but instead of turning over the leaves of the Bible , he plunged his hand into the abysses of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 8]: Horror of horrors for the poor autocrat !
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 28]: -- the pocket was as empty as his own memory ; in fact it was a mere typical pocket , typical of the brains of its owner .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 50]: The cold dew of agony broke over him ; he turned deadly pale ; his knees smote one another ; but he made yet , for he was a man of strong will , a final frantic effort to bring his discourse down the inclined plane of a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 41]: `` In fine , '' he stammered `` my beloved brethren , if you do not repent and be converted and return to the Lord , you will -- you will -- you will have a very bad harvest . ''
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 36]: Having uttered this solemn prediction , of the import of which he , like some other prophets , knew nothing before he uttered it , Murdoch Malison sat down , _ a stickit minister _ .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 18]: His brain was a vacuum ; and the thought of standing up again to pray was intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 18]: No more could he sit there ; for if he sat , the people would sit too .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 13]: Something must be done , and there was nobody to do anything .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 12]: He must get out and then the people would go home .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 6]: But how could he escape ?
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 15]: He durst not go down that pulpit stair in the sight of the congregation .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 10]: -- He cared no more for his vanished reputation .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 9]: His only thought was how to get out .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 7]: Meantime the congregation was variously affected .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 9]: Some held down their heads and laughed immoderately .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 31]: These were mostly of Mr Malison 's scholars , the fine edge of whose nature , if it ever had any , had vanished under the rasp of his tortures .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 47]: Even Alec , who , with others of the assembly , held down his head from sympathetic shame , could not help remembering how the master had made Annie Anderson stand upon the form , and believing for the time in a general retribution in kind .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 6]: Andrew Truffey was crying bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 49]: His sobs were heard through the church , and some took them for the sobs of Murdoch Malison , who had shrunk into the pulpit like a snail into its shell , so that not an atom of his form was to be seen except from the side-galleries .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 50]: The maiden daughter of the late schoolmaster gave a shriek , and went into a small fit ; after which an awful , quite sepulchral silence reigned for a few moments , broken only by those quivering sobs from Truffey , whom his grandfather was feebly and ineffectually shaking .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 27]: At length the precentor , George Macwha , who had for some time been turning over the leaves of his psalm-book , came to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 16]: He rose in the lectern and gave out _ The hundred and fifty-first psalm _ .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 22]: The congregation could only find a hundred and fifty , and took the last of the psalms for the one meant .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 38]: But George , either from old spite against the tormentor of boys and girls , or from mere coincidence -- he never revealed which -- had chosen in reality a part of the _ fifty-first _ psalm .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 18]: `` The hunner an ' fifty-first psalm , '' repeated George , `` from the fifteent verse .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 8]: An ' syne we 'll gang hame .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 16]: My closed lips , O Lord , by thee , Let them be opened . ''
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 54]: As soon as the singing was over , George left the desk , and the congregation following his example , went straggling out of the church , and home , to wait with doubtful patience for the broth which as yet could taste only of onions and the stone that scoured the pot .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 44]: As soon as the sounds of retiring footsteps were heard no more in the great echoing church , uprose , like one of Dante 's damned out of a torture-tomb , the form of Murdoch Malison , above the edge of the pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 53]: With face livid as that of a corpse , he gave a scared look around , and not seeing little Truffey concealed behind one of the pillars , concluded the place empty , and half crawled , half tumbled down the stair to the vestry , where the sexton was waiting him .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 58]: It did not restore his lost composure to discover , in searching for his handkerchief , that the encumbrance of the gown had made him put his hand ten times into the same pocket , instead of five times into each , and that in the other his manuscript lay as safe as it had been useless .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 37]: But he took his gown off very quietly , put on his coat and forgot the bands , bade the old sexton a gentle _ good day _ , and stole away home through the streets .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 38]: He had wanted to get out , and now he wanted to get in ; for he felt very much as Lady Godiva would have felt if her hair or her heroism had proved unworthy of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 18]: Poor Murdoch had no mother and no wife ; he could not go home and be comforted .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 17]: Nor was he a youth , to whom a first failure might be of small consequence .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 29]: He was five and forty , and his head was sprinkled with grey ; he was schoolmaster , and everybody knew him ; he had boys under him .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 46]: As he walked along the deserted streets , he felt that he was running the gauntlet of scorn ; but every one who saw him coming along with his head sunk on his bosom , drew back from the window till he had gone by .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 48]: Returning to the window to look after him , they saw , about twenty yards behind him , a solitary little figure , with the tears running down its face , stumping slowly step by step , and keeping the same distance , after the dejected master .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 26]: When Mr Malison went into the vestry , Truffey had gone into the porch , and there staid till he passed on his way home .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 27]: Then with stealthily set crutch , putting it down as the wild beast sets down his miching paw , out sprang Truffey and after the master .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 41]: But however silently Truffey might use his third leg , the master heard the _ stump stump _ behind him , and felt that he was followed home every foot of the way by the boy whom he had crippled .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 44]: He felt , too , in some dim degree which yet had practical results , that the boy was taking divine vengeance upon him , heaping on his head the coals of that consuming fire which is love , which is our God .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 21]: And when the first shame was over , the thought of Truffey came back with healing on his lonely heart .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 38]: When he reached his own door , he darted in and closed it behind , as if to shut out the whole world through which he had passed with that burden of contempt upon his degraded shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 16]: He was more ashamed of his failure than he had been sorry for laming Truffey .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 11]: But the shame would pass ; the sorrow would endure .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 20]: Meantime two of his congregation , sisters , poor old _ mutched wifies _ , were going home together .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 37]: They were distantly related to the schoolmaster , whom they regarded as the honour of the family , as their bond of relation with the world above them in general and with the priesthood in particular .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 28]: So when Elspeth addressed Meg with reference to the sermon in a manner which showed her determination to acknowledge no failure , Meg took her cue directly .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 21]: woman ; it 's a sair ootluik for puir fowk like us , gin things be gaein that gait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 10]: `` And ` deed it 's that , lass !
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 29]: Gin the hairst be gaein to the moles and the bats , it 's time we war awa hame ; for it 'll be a cauld winter . ''
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 7]: `` Ay , that it will !
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 13]: The minister was sair owercome at the prospec ' , honest man .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 23]: It was a ' he cud do , to win at the en ' o ' his discoorse ohn grutten ootricht . ''
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 11]: `` He sees into the will o ' the Almichty .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 14]: He 's far ben wi ' Him -- that 's verra clear . ''
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 8]: `` Ay , lass , ay . ''
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 67]: And hence , by slow degrees , in the middle of the vague prophecies of vengeance gathered a more definite kernel of prediction , believed by some , disbelieved , yet feared , by others -- that the harvest would be so eaten of worms and blasted with smut , that bread would be up to famine prices , and the poor would die of starvation .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 43]: But still the flowers came out and looked men in the face and went in again ; and still the sun shone on the evil and on the good , and still the rain fell on the just and on the unjust .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 27]: And still the denunciations from the pulpits went on ; but the human souls thus exposed to the fires seemed only to harden under their influences .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVII .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 47]: Before the period of Kate 's visit arrived , a letter from Professor Fraser , to the purport that if Mrs Forbes did not mind keeping Kate a little longer he would be greatly indebted to her , came to Alec like a reprieve from execution .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 15]: And the _ little longer _ lengthened into the late harvest of that country .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 14]: The summer shone on , and the corn grew , green and bonnie .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 31]: And Alec 's love grew with the corn ; and Kate liked him better and better , but was not a whit more inclined to fall in love with him .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 28]: One night , after the house was quiet , Alec , finding he could not sleep , rose and went out to play the ghost a while .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 6]: It was a sultry night .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 11]: Great piles of cloud were heaped up in the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 21]: The moon gleamed and vanished by fits , looking old and troubled when she sighed herself out of a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 18]: `` There 's a storm coming , '' said Alec to himself ; and watched and waited .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 6]: There was no wind below .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 27]: The leaves of the black poplar , so ready to tremble , hung motionless ; and not a bat came startling on its unheard skinny wing .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 21]: But ere long a writhing began in the clouds overhead , and they were twisted and torn about the moon .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 35]: Then came a blinding flash , and a roar of thunder , followed by a bellowing , as if the air were a great dram , on which Titanic hands were beating and rolling .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 17]: Then the rain poured down , and the scent of the earth rose into the air .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 10]: Alec ran to look up at Kate 's window .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 16]: His heart bounded when he saw a white figure looking out into the stormy dark .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 3]: `` Kate !
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 3]: Kate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 16]: he cried , in a loud whisper , `` come out -- do come out .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 6]: It 's so splendid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 6]: She started and drew back .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 14]: Presently she reappeared , and opening the window , said , `` Alec !
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 5]: do come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 6]: You come out , Kate .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 9]: You do n't know what it 's like .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 10]: You have only to get into bed again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 3]: Kate hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 8]: But in a moment more she withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 14]: Alec saw she meant to come , and flew round to the door .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 15]: In a few minutes she glided silently out , and fronted the black sky .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 22]: The same moment another flash , in which her spirit seemed to her to be universal , flung the darkness aside .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 9]: She could have counted the houses of Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 9]: The hills rose up within her very soul .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 6]: The Glamour shone in silver .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 6]: The harvest gleamed in green .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 10]: The larch-forest hung like a cloud on the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 28]: Then the blank dark folded again its scared wings over the world ; and the trees rustled their leaves with one wavy sweep , and were still .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 23]: And again the rain came down in a tumult -- warm , genial summer rain , full of the life of lightning .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 22]: Alec stood staring through the dull dark , as if he would see Kate by the force of his will alone .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 34]: The tempest in the heavens had awaked a like tempest in his bosom : would the bosom beside his receive his lightning and calm his pent-up storm by giving it space to rave ?
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 6]: His hand took hers beseechingly .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 10]: Another flash came , and he saw her face .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 15]: The whole glory of the night gloomed and flashed and flowed in that face .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 3]: But alas !
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 16]: its response was to the stormy heaven alone , not to the stormy human soul .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 25]: As the earth answers the heaven with lightning of her own , so Kate , herself a woman-storm , responded to the elemental cry .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 35]: Her shawl had fallen back , and he saw a white arm uplifted , bare to the shoulder , gleaming through the night , and an eye flashing through the flood that filled it .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 7]: He could not mistake her passion .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 38]: He knew that it was not for him ; that she was a harp played upon by the elements ; yet , passioned still more with her passion , he cried aloud , `` Oh , Kate !
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 11]: if you do not love me I shall die . ''
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 17]: Kate started , and sought to take her hand from his , but she could not .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 13]: `` Let me go , Alec , '' she said , pleadingly .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 21]: His fingers relaxed , and she sped into the house like a bird , leaving him standing in the night .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 6]: There was no more lightning .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 7]: The rain fell heavy and persistent .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 4]: The wind rose .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 38]: And when the dawn came , the clouds were drifting over the sky ; and the day was a wet gray fringy mass of wind and rain and cloud , tossing trees , and corn hard bested .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 7]: He rose and dragged himself away .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 28]: He had thrown himself upon the grass , and had burned there till his exhausted feelings lay like smouldering fire under the pale ashes of the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 13]: When Kate made her appearance at breakfast she looked bright and cold .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 17]: She had told his mother about last night , though how much he could only guess .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 22]: When he asked her whether he might not read to her , she only said , `` If you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 6]: Whereupon he did not like .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 6]: It was a dreary day .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 20]: He crept about the house like a child in disgrace , and the darkness seemed an age in coming .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 26]: When the candles were brought , he went to bed ; and when his mother went up , she found him asleep , but feverish .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 7]: When he woke he was delirious .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 12]: For a week there was nothing but wet and windy weather .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 5]: Alec was in bed .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 4]: Kate was unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 5]: Mrs Forbes was anxious .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 6]: The corn was badly lodged .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 74]: Patches lay prone , tangled , spiky , and rough ; and it was evident that if sunshine , strong , healthy sunshine , did not soon break out , the wretched mooncalf-prediction of Murdoch Malison would come true , for the corn , instead of ripening , would start a fresh growth , and the harvest would be a very bad one indeed , whether the people of Glamerton repented or not .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 12]: But after a grievous week , that blessed sunshine did come .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 23]: The corn rose up from its low estate , looked at the sun , gathered heart , and began to ripen diligently .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 14]: But Alec was very ill , and did not see Kate for weeks .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 46]: Through his wanderings -- so strangely does the thousand times o'erwritten palimpsest of the brain befool the mind and even the passions by the redawning of old traces -- he talked on about Annie and their schooldays with Mr Malison , and never mentioned Kate .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 31]: Annie went often to inquire after him , and Mrs Forbes behaved to her with her old kindness -- just a little diluted by anxiety and the possession of Kate .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 26]: When Annie thought with herself what she could do for him , she could never think of anything except saying _ sangs _ to him .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 10]: But the time for that was long gone by .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 18]: So , like many other devotions , hers found no outlet but in asking how he was .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 19]: At length , one day , he was brought down to the dining-room and laid upon the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 23]: Then for the first time since his illness he saw Kate , He looked in her face pitifully and kissed her hand .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 8]: She put her face down to his .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 29]: The blood surged up into his cheek , and the light into his eyes , and he murmured : `` That is worth being ill for , Kate .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 9]: I would be ill again for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 38]: She could only say _ hush _ , and then kiss him again , lest he should be hurt , thinking with a soundless sigh : `` I shall be forced to marry him some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 25]: And he was neither her own virgin-born ideal ; nor had his presence the power to beget another and truer ideal in her brain .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 8]: From that day he made rapid progress .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 50]: Kate would read to him for hours ; and when for love and weakness -- an ill-matched pair -- he could not look in her face any more , he would yet lie and listen , till her voice filled him with repose , and he slept in music .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVIII .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 20]: On the Monday morning after his terrible failure Mr Malison felt almost too ill to go to the school .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 14]: But he knew that if he gave in he must leave the place .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 35]: And he had a good deal of that courage which enables a man to front the inevitable , and reap , against his liking , the benefits that spring from every fate steadfastly encountered .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 20]: So he went , keeping a calm exterior over the shame and mortification that burned and writhed within him .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 75]: He prayed the morning prayer , falteringly but fluently ; called up the Bible-class ; corrected their blunders with an effort over himself which imparted its sternness to the tone of the correction and made him seem oblivious of his own , though in truth the hardest task he had ever had was to find fault that Monday ; in short , did everything as usual , except bring out the _ tag _ .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 18]: How could he punish failure who had himself so shamefully failed in the sight of them all ?
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 35]: And , to the praise of Glamerton be it recorded , never had there been a quieter day , one of less defiance of law , than that day of the master 's humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 42]: In the afternoon Andrew Truffey laid a splendid bunch of cottage-flowers on his desk , and the next morning it was so crowded with offerings of the same sort that he had quite a screen behind which to conceal his emotion .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 13]: Wonderful , let me say once more , is the divine revenge !
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 11]: The children would wipe away the humiliation of their tyrant .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 107]: His desk , the symbol of merciless law , the ark containing no pot of manna , only the rod that never budded , became an altar heaped with offerings , behind which the shamed divinity bowed his head and acknowledged a power greater than that of stripes -- overcome by his boys , who hated spelling and figures , hated yet more the Shorter Catechism , could hardly be brought to read the book of Leviticus with decency , and hated to make bricks without straw ; and yet , forgetting it all , loved the man beneath whose lashes they had writhed in torture .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 93]: In his heart the master vowed , with a new love which loosed the millstone of many offences against the little ones , that had for years been hanging about his neck -- vowed that , be the shame what it might , he would never leave them , but spend his days in making up for the hardness of his heart and hand ; vowed that he would himself be good , and so make them good ; that he would henceforth be their friend , and let them know it .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 8]: Blessed failure ending in such a victory !
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 4]: Blessed purgatorial pulpit !
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 28]: into which he entered full of self and self-ends ; and from which he came down disgusted with that paltry self as well as its deserved defeat .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 34]: The gates of its evil fortress were now undefended , for Pride had left them open in scorn ; and Love , in the form of flower-bearing children , rushed into the citadel .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 23]: The heart of the master was forced to yield , and the last state of that man was better than the first .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 22]: `` Swift Summer into the Autumn flowed , '' and yet there was no sign of the coming vengeance of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 14]: The green corn turned pale at last before the gaze of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 29]: The life within had done its best and now shrunk back to the earth , leaving the isolated life of its children to the ripening of the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 14]: Anxious farmers watched their fields , and joyfully noted every shade of progress .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 42]: All day the sun shone strong ; and all night the moon leaned down from heaven to see how things were going on , and keep the work gently moving , till the sun should return to take it up again .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 50]: Before he came , a shadowy frost would just breathe on the earth , which , although there was only death in its chill , yet furthered the goings on of life in repelling the now useless sap , and so helping the sun to dry the ripening ears .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 37]: At length the new revelation of ancient life was complete , and the corn stood in living gold , and men began to put in the sickle , because the time of the harvest was come .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 19]: And with it came the _ hairst-play _ , the event of school-life both to master and scholars .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 21]: But the feelings with which the master watched and longed for it were sadly different from those of the boys .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 45]: It was delight itself to the latter to think of having nothing to do on those glorious hot days but gather blaeberries , or lie on the grass , or bathe in the Glamour and dry themselves in the sun ten times a day .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 18]: For the master , he only hoped to get away from the six thousand eyes of Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 31]: Not one allusion had been made in his hearing to his dismal degradation , but he knew that that was only because it was too dreadful to be alluded to .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 62]: Every time he passed a woman with a baby in her arms at a cottage door , the blind eyes in the back of his head saw her cuddling her child , and the ears that are always hearing what never was said , heard her hope that _ he _ would never bring such disgrace upon himself and upon her .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 29]: The tone of additional kindness and consideraton with which many addressed him , only made him think of what lay behind , and refuse every invitation given him .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 59]: But if he were once `` in secret shadow far from all men 's sight , '' his oppressed heart would begin to revive , and he might gather strength enough to face with calmness what he would continue to face somehow , in the performance of his arrears of duty to the boys and girls of Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 9]: Can one ever bring up arrears of duty ?
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 9]: Can one ever make up for wrong done ?
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 8]: Will not heaven be an endless repentance ?
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 14]: It would need a book to answer the first two of these questions .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 17]: To the last of them I answer , `` Yes -- but a glad repentance . ''
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 7]: At length the slow hour arrived .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 23]: Longing thoughts had almost obliterated the figures upon Time 's dial , and made it look a hopeless undivided circle of eternity .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 38]: But at length twelve o'clock on Saturday came ; and the delight would have been almost unendurable to some , had it not been calmed by the dreary proximity of the Sabbath lying between them and freedom .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 13]: To add to their joy , there was no catechism that day .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 20]: The prayer , although a little longer than usual , was yet over within a minute after the hour .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 28]: And almost as soon as the _ Amen _ was out of the master 's mouth , the first boys were shouting jubilantly in the open air .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 27]: Truffey , who was always the last , was crutching it out after the rest , when he heard the master 's voice calling him back .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 14]: He obeyed it with misgiving -- so much had fear become a habit .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 32]: `` Ask your grandfather , Andrew , if he will allow you to go down to the seaside with me for a fortnight or three weeks , '' said the master .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 57]: `` Yes , sir , '' Truffey meant to say , but the attempt produced in reality an unearthly screech of delight , with which he went off on a series of bounds worthy of a kangaroo , lasting all the way to his grandfather 's , and taking him there in half the usual time .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 13]: And the master and Truffey did go down to the sea together .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 32]: The master borrowed a gig and hired a horse and driver ; and they sat all three in the space meant for two , and their boxes went by the carrier .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 21]: To happy Truffey a lame leg or two was not to be compared with the exultant glory of that day .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 9]: Was he not the master 's friend henceforth ?
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 12]: And was he not riding in a gig -- bliss supreme ?
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 25]: And was not the harvest around them , the blue tent of the sun over their heads , and the sea somewhere before them ?
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 39]: Truffey was prouder than Mr Malison could have been if , instead of the result of that disastrous Sunday , he had been judged to surpass Mr Turnbull in pulpit gifts , as he did in scholastic acquirements .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 18]: And if there be as much joy in the universe , what matter how it be divided !
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 22]: -- whether the master be raised from the desk to the pulpit , or Truffey have a ride in a gig !
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 30]: About this time Tibbie , sitting too late one evening upon the grass , caught a bad cold and cough , and was for a fortnight confined to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 21]: Within two days Annie became her constant companion -- that is , from the moment _ the play _ commenced .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 25]: `` I tell ' t ye I wad hae the licht afore lang , '' she said the first time Annie came to her .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 5]: `` Hoots , Tibbie !
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 33]: It 's only an ill caud an ' a host , '' said Annie , who from being so much with her and Thomas had caught the modes of an elderly woman .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 7]: `` Ye maunna be doonhertit . ''
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 3]: `` Doonhertit !
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 6]: The lassie 's haverin ' !
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 16]: Wha daured to say that I was doonhertit within sicht o ' the New Jerusalem ?
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 14]: Order yer words better , lassie , or else haud yer tongue . ''
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 8]: `` I beg yer pardon , Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 4]: It was ill-considered .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 28]: But ye see hooever willin ' ye may be to gang , we 're nane sae willin ' to lat gang the grip o ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 12]: `` Ye 'll be a hantle better withoot me , lass .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 5]: Oh , my heid !
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 28]: And the host 's jist like to rive me in bits , as the prophets rave their claes whan the fowk contred them ower sair to bide .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 2]: Aweel !
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 33]: This body 's nothing but a wheen claes to my sowl ; and no verra weel made either , for the holes for my een war forgotten i ' the makin ' .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 39]: -- I 'm bit jokin ' , lassie ; for it was the Lord 's han ' that made and mismade my claes ; and I 'm weel willin ' to wear them as lang 's he likes .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 10]: Jist mak a drappy o ' stoorum to me .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 9]: Maybe it 'll ile my thrapple a bit .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 9]: I winna be lang ahin Eppie Shawn . ''
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 20]: That was the woman who had occupied the other end of the cottage and had died in the spring .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 9]: So Annie waited on Tibbie day and night .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 20]: And that year , for the first time since she came to Glamerton , the harvest began without her .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 25]: But when Tibbie got a little better , she used to run out now and then to see what progress the reapers were making .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 36]: One bright forenoon Tibbie , feeling better , said to her , `` Noo , bairn , I 'm a hantle better the day , and ye maun jist rin oot and play yersel ' .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 16]: Ye 're but a bairn , though ye hae the wit o ' a wumman .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 23]: Ye 'll be laid up yersel ' gin ye dinna get a stammachfu ' o ' the caller air noo and than .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 17]: Sae jist rin awa ' , an ' dinna lat me see ye afore denner-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 31]: At Howglen , there happened , this year , to be a field of oats not far from the house , the reaping of which was to begin that day .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 10]: It was very warm , and glorious with sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 41]: So , after a few stooks had been set up , Alec crawled out with the help of his mother and Kate , and lay down on some sheaves , sheltered from the sun by a stook , and watched .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 11]: The men and women and corn leaned all one way .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 37]: The oats hung their curved heads of little pendulous bells , and gave out a low murmuring sibilation -- its only lament that its day was over , and sun and wind no more for it .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 33]: Through the high stalks gleamed now and then the lowly corn flower , and he watched for the next blue star that would shine out as they cut the golden cloud away .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 13]: But the sun rose till the stook could shelter him no more .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 24]: First came a flickering of the shadows of the longest heads athwart his face , and then the sun shone full upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 37]: His mother and Kate had left him for a while , and , too weak or too lazy to move , he lay with closed eyes , wishing that some one would come to his help .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 7]: Nor had he to wait long .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 7]: A sudden shadow came over him .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 41]: When he looked up to find the source of the grateful relief , he could see nothing but an apron held up in two little hands behind the stook -- hiding both the sun and the face of the helper .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 6]: `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 16]: `` It 's me -- Annie Anderson , '' came from behind the un-moving apron .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 11]: Now why would not Alec accept this attention from Annie ?
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 12]: `` Dinna stan ' there , Annie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 6]: `` I dinna want it .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 9]: My mother will be here in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 7]: I see her comin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 11]: Annie dropped her arms , and turned away in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 20]: If Alec could have seen her face , he would have been sorry that he had refused her service .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 16]: She vanished in a moment , so that Mrs Forbes and Kate never saw her .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 17]: They sat down beside him so as to shelter him , and he fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 24]: When he woke , he found his head in Kate 's lap , and her parasol casting a cool green shadow over him .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 6]: His mother had gone again .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 23]: Having made these discoveries , he closed his eyes , and pretending to be still asleep , lay in a waking dream .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 9]: But dreams themselves must come to an end .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 15]: Kate soon saw that his face was awake , although his eyes were closed .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 18]: `` I think it is time we went into the house , Alec , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 10]: `` You have been asleep nearly an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 11]: `` Happy so long , and not know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 12]: returned he , looking up at her from where he lay .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 5]: Kate blushed a little .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 14]: I think she began to feel that he was not quite a boy .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 14]: But he obeyed her like a child , and they went in together .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 28]: When Annie vanished among the stooks after the rejection of her offered shadow , a throbbing pain at her heart kept her from returning to the reapers .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 21]: She wandered away up the field towards a little old cottage , in which some of the farm servants resided .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 20]: She knew that Thomas Crann was at work there , and found him busy rough-casting the outside of it .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 20]: `` Ye 're busy harlin ' , Thomas , '' said Annie , for the sake of saying something .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 39]: `` Ay , jist helpin ' to mak ' a heepocreet , '' answered Thomas , with a nod and a grim smile , as he threw a trowelful of mortar mixed with small pebbles against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 8]: `` What mean ye by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 3]: rejoined Annie .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 21]: `` Gin ye kent this auld bothie as weel as I do , ye wadna need to spier that question .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 17]: It sud hae been pu'ed doon fra the riggin to the fundation a century afore noo .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 39]: And here we 're pittin a clean face upo ' ` t , garrin ' ' t luik as gin it micht stan ' anither century , and nobody had a richt to luik asclent at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 9]: `` It _ luiks _ weel eneuch . ''
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 14]: `` I tell ' t ye that I was makin ' a heepocreet .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 72]: There 's no a sowl wants this hoose to stan ' but the mistress doon there , that doesna want to waur the siller , and the rottans inside the wa 's o ' ` t , that doesna want to fa ' into the cluiks o ' Bawdrins and Colley -- wha lie in wait for sic like jist as the deevil does for the sowl o ' the heepocreet .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 10]: -- Come oot o ' the sun , lassie .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 23]: This auld hoose is no a ` thegither a heepocreet : it can haud the sun aff o ' ye yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 28]: Thomas had seen Annie holding her hand to her head , an action occasioned partly by the heat and partly by the rebuff Alec had given her .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 8]: She stepped into the shadow beside him .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 14]: `` Isna the warl ' fu ' o ' bonnie things cheap ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 4]: Thomas went on .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 10]: `` The sun 's fine and het the day .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 61]: And syne whan he 's mair nor we can bide , there 's lots o ' shaidows lyin ' aboot upo ' the face o ' the warl ' ; though they say there 's some countries whaur they 're scarce , and the shaidow o ' a great rock 's thought something o ' in a weary lan ' ?
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 18]: But we sudna think less o ' a thing 'cause there 's plenty o ' ` t .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 22]: We hae a heap o ' the gospel , but we dinna think the less o ' ' t for that .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 39]: Because ye see it 's no whether shaidows be dear or no that we think muckle or little o ' them , but whether we be richt het and tired whan we win till ane o ' them .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 10]: It 's that ` at maks the differ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 16]: Sorrow herself will reveal one day that she was only the beneficent shadow of Joy .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 11]: Will Evil ever show herself the beneficent shadow of Good ?
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 17]: `` Whaur got Robert Bruce that gran ' Bible , Annie , do ye ken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 14]: resumed Thomas , after whitening his hypocrite in silence for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 8]: `` That 's my Bible , Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 18]: Auld Mr Cowie gae ' t to me whan he was lyin ' near-han ' deith . ''
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 3]: `` Hm !
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 2]: hm !
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 22]: And hoo cam ' ' t that ye didna tak ' it and pit it i ' yer ain kist ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 21]: `` Maister Bruce tuik it and laid it i ' the room as sune 's I brocht it hame . ''
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 18]: `` Did Maister Cowie say onything to ye aboot onything that was i n't , no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 6]: `` Ay , did he .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 16]: He spak ' o ' a five-poun ' note that he had pitten i n't .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 18]: But whan I luikit for ` t , I cudna fin ' ` t. '' `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 9]: Whan did ye luik for ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 15]: `` I forgot it for twa or three days -- maybe a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 32]: `` Do ye min ' that Sunday nicht that twa or three o ' 's cam hame wi ' Bruce , and had worship wi ' him an ' you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 6]: `` Ay , weel eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 14]: It was the first time he read oot o ' my Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 17]: `` Was ' t afore or efter that ` at ye luikit for the nott ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 22]: `` It was the neist day ; for the sicht o ' the Bible pat it i ' my min ' .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 37]: I oughtna to hae thocht aboot it o ' the Sawbath ; but it cam ' o ' ` tsel ' ; and I didna luik till the Mononday mornin ' , afore they war up .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 14]: I reckon Mr Cowie forgot to pit it in efter a ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 3]: `` Hm !
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 2]: hm !
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 2]: Ay !
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 36]: -- Weel , ye see , riches taks to themsels wings and flees awa ' ; and sae we maunna set oor herts upo ' them , for it 's no manner o ' use .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 7]: We get nothing by ` t .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 17]: The warst bank that a man can lay up his siller in is his ain hert .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 9]: And I 'll tell ye hoo that is .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 19]: Ye ken whan meal 's laid up ower lang it breeds worms , and they eat the meal .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 24]: But they do little hairm forbye , for they 're saft craters , and their teeth canna do muckle ill to the girnell .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 143]: But there 's a kin ' o ' roost that gathers and a kin ' o ' moth that breeds i ' the gowd and siller whan they 're laid up i ' the hert ; and the roost 's an awfu ' thing for eatin ' awa ' , and the moth-craters hae teeth as hard 's the siller that breeds them ; and instead o ' eatin ' the siller , like the meal-worms , they fa ' upo ' the girnel itsel ' -- that 's the heart ; and afore lang the hert itsel 's roostit awa ' wi ' the roost , and riddlet through and through wi ' the moths , till it 's a naisty fushionless thing , o ' no use to God or man , not even to mak ' muck o ' .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 10]: Sic a crater 's hardly worth damnin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 23]: And Thomas threw trowelful after trowelful of rough-cast upon the wall , making his hypocrite in all the composure of holy thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 9]: And Annie forgot her trouble in his presence .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 56]: For Thomas was one of those whom the prophet foresaw when he said : `` And a man shall be as an hiding-place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as a shadow of a great rock in a weary land . ''
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 71]: I do not mean that Thomas was felt to be such by all whom he encountered ; for his ambition was to rouse men from the sleep of sin ; to set them face to face with the terrors of Mount Sinai ; to `` shak ' them ower the mou ' o ' the pit , '' till they were all but choked with the fumes of the brimstone .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 33]: But he was a shelter to Annie -- and to Tibbie also , although she and he were too much of a sort to appear to the best advantage in their intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 8]: `` Hoo 's Tibbie the day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 3]: said Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 14]: `` She 's a wee bit better the day , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 41]: `` It 's a great preevileege , lassie , and ane that ye 'll hae to answer for , to be sae muckle wi ' ane o ' the Lord 's elec ' as ye are wi ' Tibbie Dyster .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 29]: She 's some thrawn -LRB- twisted -RRB- whiles , but she 's a good honest woman , wha has the glory o ' God sair at her hert .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 62]: And she 's tellt me my duty and my sins in a mainner worthy o ' Debohrah the prophetess ; and I aye set mysel ' to owercome them as gin they had been the airmy o ' Sisera , wham Jael , the wife o ' Heber , the Kenite , killed efter a weel-deserved but some cooardly faushion . ''
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 10]: Annie did not return to the harvest-field that day .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 10]: She did not want to go near Alec again .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 30]: So , after lingering a while with Thomas , she wandered slowly across some fields of barley-stubble through which the fresh young clover was already spreading its soft green .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 41]: She then went over the Glamour by the bridge with the three arches , down the path at the other end , over the single great stone that crossed the dyer 's dam , and so into Tibbie 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 50]: Had Annie been Robert Bruce 's own , she would have had to mind the baby , to do part of the house work , and , being a wise child , to attend in the shop during meals , and so expedite the feeding-process which followed the grace .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 17]: But Robert Bruce was ignorant of how little Annie knew about the investment of her property .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 32]: He took her freedom of action for the result of the knowledge that she paid her way , whereas Annie followed her own impulse , and never thought about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 23]: Indeed , with the reticence of Scotch people , none of her friends had given her any information about her little fortune .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 22]: Had Bruce known this , there would have been no work too constant for her , and no liberty too small .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 12]: Thomas did not doubt that Robert Bruce had stolen the note .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 14]: But he did not see yet what he ought to do about it .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 17]: The thing would be hard to prove , and the man who would steal would lie .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 17]: But he bitterly regretted that such a man should have found his way into their communion .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIX .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 17]: At length the corn was gathered in , all over the valley of the two rivers .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 46]: The wool of the sheep grows again after they are shorn , to keep them warm in the winter : when the dry stubble sticks up short and bristly over the fields , to keep them warm `` He scattereth his snows like wool . ''
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 16]: The master returned from the sea-coast , bringing Truffey with him , radiant with life .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 24]: Nothing could lengthen that shrunken limb , but in the other and the crutch together he had more than the function of two .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 7]: And the master was his idol .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 8]: And the master was a happier man .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 16]: The scene of his late failure had begun to fade a little from his brain .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 24]: The expanse of the church and the waiting people was no longer a vision certain to arise in the darkness that surrounds sleep .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 32]: He had been loving and helping ; and love and help had turned into a great joy , whose tide washed from out his heart the bitterness of his remembered sin .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 15]: When we love truly , all oppression of past sin will be swept away .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 19]: Love is the final atonement , of which and for which the sacrifice of the atonement was made .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 23]: And till this atonement is made in every man , sin holds its own , and God is not all in all .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 13]: So the earth and all that was therein did the master good .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 20]: And he came back able to look people in the face -- humble still , but no longer humiliated .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 54]: And when the children gathered once more on a Monday morning , with the sad feeling that the holidays were over , the master 's prayer was different from what it used to be , and the work was less irksome than before , and school was not so very hateful after all .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 18]: Even the Shorter Catechism was not the instrument of torture which it had been wont to be .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 13]: The cords of the rack were not strained so tight as heretofore .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 30]: But the cool bright mornings , and the frosty evenings , with the pale green sky after sundown , spoke to the heart of Alec of a coming loss .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 31]: Not that Kate had ever shown that she loved him , so that he even felt a restless trouble in her presence which had not been favourable to his recovery .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 102]: Yet as he lay in the gloaming , and watched those crows flying home , they seemed to be bearing something away with them on their black wings ; and as the light sank and paled on the horizon , and the stars began to condense themselves into sparks amid the sea of green , like those that fleet phosphorescent when the prow of the vessel troubles the summer sea , and then the falling stars of September shot across the darkening sky , he felt that a change was near , that for him winter was coming before its time .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 44]: And the trees saw from their high watch-tower the white robe of winter already drifting up above the far horizon on the wind that followed his footsteps , and knew what that wind would be when it howled tormenting over those naked fields .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 26]: So their leaves turned yellow and gray , and the frosty red of age was fixed upon them , and they fell , and lay .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 42]: On one of those bright mornings , which make the head feel so clear , the limbs so strong , and the heart so sad , the doom fell in the expected form , that of a letter from the Professor .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 38]: He was at home at last , and wanted his niece to mix his toddy , and scold his servants for him , from both of which enjoyments he said he desired to wean himself in time .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 7]: Alec 's heart sank within him .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 12]: `` Do n't go yet , Kate , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 8]: But he felt that she must go .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 17]: An early day was fixed for her return ; and his summer would go with her .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 20]: The day before her departure they were walking together along one of the rough parish-roads leading to the hills .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 6]: `` Oh , Kate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 25]: exclaimed Alec , all at once , in an outburst of despair , `` what _ shall _ I do when you are gone ?
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 7]: Everything will look so hateful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 6]: `` Oh , Alec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 9]: rejoined Kate , in a tone of expostulation .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 15]: `` They will all look the same as if you had not gone away !
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 8]: -- so heartless , so selfish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 11]: `` But I shall see you in November again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 5]: You will see me .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 8]: But shall I see _ you _ ?
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 7]: -- this very _ you _ ?
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 4]: Oh , Kate !
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 2]: Kate !
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 9]: I feel that you will be different then .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 11]: You will not look at me as you do now .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 11]: You are kind to me because I have been ill .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 8]: You pity me for my white face .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 7]: It is very good of you .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 11]: But _ wo n't _ you love me , Kate ?
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 6]: I do n't deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 17]: But I 've read so often of beautiful women loving men who did not deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 10]: Perhaps I may be worthy of it some day .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 12]: And by that time you will have loved somebody else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 9]: He turned involuntarily , and walked towards home .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 23]: He recovered himself instantly , however , and returning put his hand on Kate 's arm , who was frightened and anxious .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 22]: Like a child praying to his mother , he repeated : '' _ Wo n't _ you love me , Kate ?
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 5]: -- Just a little ?
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 21]: -- How can I go into that room after you are gone -- and all your things out of it ?
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 11]: I am not good enough ever to sleep there again .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 10]: _ Wo n't _ you love me , Kate ?
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 4]: A little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 7]: `` I do love you dearly .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 6]: You know that , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 11]: Why do you always press me to say more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 13]: `` Because I do not like the way you say it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 19]: `` You want me to speak your way , not my own , and be a hypocrite ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 3]: `` Kate !
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 2]: Kate !
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 7]: I understand you too well . ''
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 6]: They walked home in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 17]: Now , although this was sad enough for Alec , yet there was room for hope .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 18]: But she was going away , and he would not know what she was doing or thinking .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 10]: It was as if she were going to die .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 28]: Nor was that all ; -- for -- to misuse the quotation -- `` For , in that sleep of death , what dreams might come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 23]: She might dream of some one , love some one -- yes , marry some one , and so drive him mad .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 30]: When the last night arrived , he followed her up-stairs , and knocked at her room door , to see her once again , and make one more appeal .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 12]: Now an appeal has only to do with justice or pity .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 8]: With love it is of no use .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 13]: With love it is as unavailing as wisdom or gold or beauty .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 6]: But no lover believes this .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 12]: There was no answer to the first , the inarticulate appeal .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 44]: He lost his courage , and dared not knock again ; and while Kate was standing with her head on one side , and her dress half off , wondering if any one had knocked , he crept away to his bed ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 31]: There was only a partition of lath and plaster between the two , neither of whom could sleep , but neither of whom could have given the other any comfort .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 13]: Not even another thunder-storm could have brought them together again that night .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 61]: At length the pitiless dawn , which _ will _ come , awoke Alec , and he saw the last few aged stars wither away as the great young star came up the hill , the despot who , crowned with day , drives men up and abroad , be the weather , inside or out , what it may .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 10]: It was the dreariest dawn Alec had ever known .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 12]: Kate appeared at breakfast with indescribable signs of preparation about her .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 7]: The breakfast was dull and cheerless .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 6]: The autumn sun was brilliant .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 8]: The inevitable gig appeared at the door .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 8]: Alec was not even to drive it .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 24]: He could only help her into it , kiss her gloved hand on the rail , and see her vanish behind the shrubbery .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 54]: He then turned in stern endurance , rushed up into the very room he had thought it impossible ever to enter again , caught up a handkerchief she had left behind her , pressed it to his face , threw himself on her bed , and -- well , he fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 10]: He woke not so miserable as he had expected .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 28]: Of this he was so much ashamed that he tried hard to make himself more miserable , by going over all the miseries in store for him .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 8]: But his thoughts would not obey him .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 18]: They would take their own way , fly where they pleased , and alight where they would .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 13]: And the meeting in November was the most attractive object in sight .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 16]: -- So easily is Hope born , when the time of her birth is come !
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 33]: But he soon found that Grief is like some maidens : she will not come when she is called ; but if you leave her alone , she will come of herself .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 16]: Before the day was over he had sacrificed griefs enough upon the altar of Love .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 20]: All at once the whole vacant region rushed in upon him with a ghostly sense of emptiness and desolation .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 13]: He wandered about the dreary house like a phantom about a cenotaph .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 20]: The flowers having nothing to say , because they had ceased to mean anything , looked ashamed of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 32]: The sunshine was hastening to have done with it , and let the winter come as soon as he liked , for there was no more use in shining like this .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 18]: And Alec being in love , could feel all this , although he had not much imagination .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 61]: For the poetic element has its share in the most common pug-faced man in creation ; and when he is in love , what of that sort there is in him , as well as what there is of any sort of good thing , will come to the surface , as the trout do in the balmy summer evenings .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 24]: Therefore let every gentle maiden be warned how she takes such a manifestation of what is in the man for the man himself .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 24]: It is the deepest , it is the best in him , but it may not be in the least his own yet .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 75]: It is one thing to have a mine of gold in one 's ground , know it , and work it ; and another to have the mine still but regard the story as a fable , throw the aureal hints that find their way to the surface as playthings to the woman who herself is but a plaything in the owner 's eyes , and mock her when she takes them for precious .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 28]: In a word , every man in love shows better than he is , though , thank God , not better than he is meant to become .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 13]: After Kate 's departure , Alec 's health improved much more rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 16]: Hope , supplied by his own heart , was the sunlight in which he revived .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 14]: He had one advantage over some lovers -- that he was no metaphysician .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 27]: He did not torture himself with vain attempts to hold his brain as a mirror to his heart , that he might read his heart there .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 46]: The heart is deaf and dumb and blind , but it has more in it -- more life and blessedness , more torture and death -- than any poor knowledge-machine of a brain can understand , or even delude itself into the fancy of understanding .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 37]: From the first , Kate 's presence had not been favourable to his recovery , irrespectively of the excitement and restlessness which it occasioned ; for she was an absorbent rather than a diffuser of life .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 53]: Her own unsatisfied nature , her excitableness , her openness to all influences from the external world , and her incapacity for supplying her needs in any approximate degree from inward resources ; her consequent changeableness , moodiness , and dependency -- were all unfavourable influences upon an invalid who loved her .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 20]: The first thing he did was to superintend the painting and laying up of his boat for the winter .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 14]: It was placed across the rafters of the barn , wrapt in tarpaulin .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 7]: The light grew shorter and shorter .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 48]: A few rough rainy days stripped the trees of their foliage ; and although the sun shone out again and made lovely weather , Saint Martin 's summer , halcyon days , it was plain to all the senses that the autumn was drawing to a close .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 3]: CHAPTER LX .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 13]: All the prophetic rumours of a bad harvest had proved themselves false .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 22]: Never a better harvest had been gathered in the strath , nor had one ever been carried home in superior condition .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 11]: But the passion for prophecy had not abated in Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 10]: It was a spiritual epidemic over the whole district .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 18]: Now a certain wily pedler had turned the matter over and resolved to make something of it .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 33]: One day there appeared in the streets of Glamerton a man carrying in his hand a bundle of papers as a sample of what he had in the pack upon his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 7]: He bore a burden of wrath .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 25]: They were all hymns and ballads of a minacious description , now one and now another of which he kept repeating in lugubrious recitative .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 19]: Amongst them some of Watts 's , quite unknown to Glamerton worshippers , carried the palm of horror .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 29]: But there were others which equalled them in absurdity , although their most ludicrous portions affected the populace only as a powerful realization of the vague and awful .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 35]: One of these had the following stanzas : `` The dragon 's tail shall be the whip Of scorpions foretold , With which to lash them thigh and hip That wander from the fold .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 32]: And when their wool is burnt away -- Their garments gay , I mean -- Then this same whip they 'll feel , I say , Upon their naked skin . ''
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 32]: The probability seems to be that , besides collecting from all sources known to him , the pedler had hired an able artist for the production of original poems of commination .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 25]: His scheme succeeded ; for great was the sale of these hymns and ballads at a halfpenny a piece in the streets of Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 29]: Even those who bought to laugh , could not help feeling an occasional anticipatory sting of which , being sermon-seared , they were never conscious under pulpit denunciation .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 79]: The pedler having emptied his wallet -- not like that of Chaucer 's Pardoner , `` Bretful of pardon brought from Rome all hot , '' but crammed with damnation brought all hot from a different place -- vanished ; and another wonder appeared in the streets of Glamerton -- a man who cried with a loud voice , borrowing the cry of the ill-tempered prophet : `` Yet forty days , and Glamerton shall be destroyed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 26]: This cry he repeated at awful intervals of about a minute , walking slowly through every street , lane , and close of the town .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 20]: The children followed him in staring silence ; the women gazed from their doors in awe as he passed .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 22]: The insanity which gleamed in his eyes , and his pale long-drawn countenance , heightened the effect of the terrible prediction .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 7]: His belief took theirs by storm .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 22]: The men smiled to each other , but could not keep it up in the presence of their wives and sisters .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 10]: They said truly that he was only a madman .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 49]: But as prophets have always been taken for madmen , so madmen often pass for prophets ; and even Stumpin ' Steenie , the town-constable , had too much respect either to his prophetic claims , or his lunacy , perhaps both , to take him into custody .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 38]: So through the streets of Glamerton he went on his bare feet , with tattered garments , proclaiming aloud the coming destruction , He walked in the middle of the street , and turned aside for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 36]: The coachman of the Royal Mail had to pull up his four greys on their haunches to keep them off the defiant prophet , and leave him to pursue the straight line of his mission .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 36]: The ministers warned the people on the following Sunday against false prophets , but did not say that man was a false prophet , while with their own denunciations they went on all the same .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 11]: The chief effects of it all were excitement and fear .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 7]: There was little sign of repentance .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 11]: But the spiritual physicians did not therefore doubt their exhibition .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 6]: They only increased the dose .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 6]: The prophet appeared one day .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 6]: He had vanished the next .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 20]: But within a few days , a still more awful prediction rose , cloud-like , on the spiritual sky .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 65]: A placard was found affixed to the doors of every place of worship in the town , setting forth in large letters that , according to certain irrefragable calculations from `` the number of a man '' and other such of the more definite utterances of Daniel and St John , the day of judgment must without fail fall upon the next Sunday week .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 8]: Whence this announcement came no one knew .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 21]: But the truth is , every one was willing it should remain shrouded in the mystery congenial to such things .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 107]: On the door of the parish-church , it found an especially suitable place ; for that , not having been painted for many years , still retained the mourning into which it had been put on occasion of the death of the great man of the neighbourhood , the owner of all Glamerton , and miles around it -- this mourning consisting of a ground of dingy black , over which at small regular distances had been painted a multitude of white spots with tails , rather more like commas than tadpoles , intended to represent the falling tears of lamenting tenants and humble servants generally .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 11]: Curly 's grandfather had been the artist of the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 51]: In the middle of this door stood the awful prophecy , surrounded on every side by the fall of the faded tears ; and for anything anybody knew , it might have been a supernatural exudation from the damp old church , full of decay for many a dreary winter .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 13]: Dreadful places , those churches , hollow and echoing all the week !
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 28]: I wonder if the souls of idle parsons are condemned to haunt them , and that is what gives them that musty odour and that exhausting air .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 17]: Glamerton was variously affected by this condensation of the vapour of prophecy into a definite prediction .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 13]: `` What think ye o ' ` t , Thomas Crann ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 4]: said Andrew Constable .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 10]: `` The calcleation seems to be a ' correck .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 9]: Yet somehoo I canna believe i n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 10]: `` Dinna fash yer heid aboot it , Anerew .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 16]: There 's a heep o ' judgments atween this an ' the hinner en ' .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 12]: The Lord 'll come whan naebody 's luikin ' for him .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 8]: And sae we maun be aye ready .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 7]: Ilka year 's an anno dominy .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 23]: But I dinna think the man that made that calcleation as ye ca ' ' t 's jist a ` thegeether infallible .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 19]: An ' for ae thing , he 's forgotten to mak ' allooance for the laip years . ''
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 9]: `` The day 's by , than ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 16]: exclaimed Andrew , in a tone contrasting pretty strongly with his previous expressions of unbelief .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 15]: `` Or else it 's nae comin ' sae sune as the prophet thocht .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 10]: I 'm no clear at this moment aboot that .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 10]: But it 's a sma ' maitter that . ''
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 10]: Andrew 's face fell , and he looked thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 9]: `` Hoo mak ' ye that oot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 5]: `` Hoots man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 60]: answered Thomas ; `` dinna ye see ` at gin the man was cawpable o ' makin ' sic a mistak 's that , i ' the mids o ' his perfec confidence in his ain knowledge an ' jeedgment , he cud hardly hae been intendit by Providence for an interpreter o ' dark sayings of old ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 6]: Andrew burst into a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 22]: `` Wha cud hae thocht , Thomas , ` at ye cud hae pickit sic gumption oot o ' stanes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 15]: And so they parted , Andrew laughing , and Thomas with a curious smile .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXI .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 26]: Towards the middle of the following week the sky grew gloomy , and a thick small incessant rain brought the dreariest weather in the world .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 15]: There was no wind , and miles of mist were gathered in the air .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 24]: After a day or two the heavens grew lighter , but the rain fell as steadily as before , and in heavier drops .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 27]: Still there was little rise in either the Glamour or the Wan Water , and the weather could not be said to be anything but seasonable .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 46]: On the Saturday afternoon , weary of some poor attempts at Greek and Latin , weary of the wretched rain , and weary with wishing to be with Kate , Alec could stay in the house no longer , and went out for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 80]: Along the bank of the river he wandered , through the rain above and the wet grass below , to the high road , stood for a moment on the bridge gazing at the muddy Glamour , which came down bank-full , -- Annie saw him from Tibbie 's window as he stood , -- and then turned and followed its course below the bridge through a wild , and now dismal country , to where the waters met .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 10]: It was getting dusk when he reached the place .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 25]: With what a roar the Wan Water came down its rocks , rushing from its steeper course into the slow incline of the Glamour !
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 17]: A terrible country they came from -- those two ocean-bound rivers -- up among the hill-tops .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 64]: There on the desolate peat-mosses , spongy , black , and cold , the rain was pouring into the awful holes whence generations had dug their fuel , and into the natural chasms of the earth , soaking the soil , and sending torrents , like the flaxen hair of a Titanic Naiad , rolling into the bosom of the rising river-god below .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 29]: The mist hung there , darkening everything with its whiteness , ever sinking in slow fall upon the slippery peat and the heather and the gray old stones .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 46]: By and by the pools would be filled , and the hidden caves ; their sides would give way ; the waters would rush from the one into the other , and from all down the hill-sides , and the earth-sponge would be drained off .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 43]: `` Gin this hauds , we 'll hae a spate , '' said Alec to himself , when he saw how the waters met , flooding the _ invers _ , and beginning to invade the trees upon the steep banks below .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 9]: The scene was in harmony with his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 18]: The delight of the sweeping waters entered his soul , and filled him with joy and strength .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 101]: As he took his way back through the stunted trees , each swathed in its own mist , and dripping as if it were a separate rain-cloud ; and through the bushes that wetted him like pools ; and through the streams that poured down the steep bank into the Glamour ; he thought how different it was when he walked there with Kate , when the sun was bright , and the trees were covered with green , and the heather was in patches of blossom , and the river went clear-hearted and singing over its stony channel below .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 14]: But he would rather have it thus , now that Kate was gone .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 18]: The floods then were slower in rising , and rose to a much greater height than now .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 36]: In the present day , the numerous drains provide a rapid and steady escape , so that there is no accumulation of waters , and no bursting of the walls of natural or accidental reservoirs .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 52]: And I presume that from slow changes produced in the climate by cultivation , there may be a less fall of water now than there used to be ; for in some parts of that country the rivers have , within the memory of middle-aged men , considerably decreased in volume .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 9]: That evening , in the schoolmaster 's lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 7]: Truffey sat at the tea-table triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 52]: The master had been so pleased with an exercise which he had written for him -- written in verse too -- that he had taken the boy home to tea with him , dried him well at his fire , and given him as much buttered toast as he could eat .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 17]: Truffey had often had a like privilege , but never for an ovation , as now .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 6]: How he loved the master !
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 30]: `` Truffey , '' said Mr Malison , after a long pause , during which he had been staring into the fire , `` how 's your leg ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 26]: `` Quite weel , thank ye , sir , '' answered Truffey , unconsciously putting out the foot of the wrong leg on the fender .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 31]: `` There wasna onything the maitter wi ' ` t. '' `` I mean the other leg , Truffey -- the one that I -- that I -- hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 6]: `` Perfectly weel , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 8]: It 's no worth speirin ' efter .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 21]: I wonner that ye tak sic pains wi ' me , sir , whan I was sic a nickum . ''
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 6]: The master could not reply .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 22]: But he was more grateful for Truffey 's generous forgiveness than he would have been for the richest living in Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 13]: Such forgiveness is just giving us back ourselves -- clean and happy .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 10]: And for what gift can we be more grateful ?
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 12]: He vowed over again to do all he could for Truffey .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 17]: Perhaps a sticket minister might have a hand in making a minister that would not stick .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 36]: Then the master read Truffey 's queer composition aloud , and notwithstanding all his conscientious criticism , Truffey was delighted with his own work when removed to an objective distance by the master 's reading .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 17]: At length Mr Malison said : `` It 's time to go home , Andrew Truffey .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 7]: Put on my cloak -- there .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 13]: And keep out of the puddles as much as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 36]: `` I 'll pit the sma ' fit in , '' said Truffey , holding up the end of his crutch , as he stretched it forward to make one bound out of the door .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 12]: For he delighted in showing off his agility to the master .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXII .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 19]: When Alec looked out of his window the next morning , he saw a broad yellow expanse below .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 13]: The Glamour was rolling , a mighty river , through the land .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 29]: A wild waste foamy water , looking cold and torn and troubled , it swept along the fields where late the corn had bowed to the autumn winds .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 9]: But he had often seen it as high .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 10]: And all the corn was safe in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 15]: Neither he nor his mother regretted much that they could not go to church .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 70]: Mrs Forbes sat by the fire and read Hannah More 's _ Christian Morals _ , and Alec sat by the window reading James Montgomery 's _ World before the Flood _ , and watching the river , and the splashing of the rain in the pluvial lake , for the water was nearly a foot deep around the house , although it stood upon a knoll of gravel .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 36]: All night Tibbie Dyster had lain awake in her lonely cottage , listening to the quiet heavy _ go _ of the water from which all the sweet babbling sounds and delicate music-tones had departed .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 20]: The articulation of the river-god was choked in the weight and hurry of its course to the expectant sea .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 30]: Tibbie was still far from well , had had many relapses , and was more than ever convinced that the Lord was going to let her see his face .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 39]: Annie would have staid with her that Saturday night , as she not unfrequently did , had she not known that Mrs Bruce would make it a pretext for giving her no change of linen for another week .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 33]: The moment Bruce entered the chapel -- for no weather deprived him of his Sabbath privileges -- Annie , who had been his companion so far , darted off to see Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 26]: When Bruce found that she had not followed him , he hurried to the door , but only to see her halfway down the street .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 23]: He returned in anger to his pew , which he was ashamed of showing thus empty to the eyes of his brethren .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 11]: But there were many pews in like condition that morning .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 18]: The rain having moderated a little in the afternoon , the chapel was crowded in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 11]: Mrs Bruce was the only one of the Bruce-family absent .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 48]: The faces of the congregation wore an expectant look , for they knew Mr Turnbull would _ improve the occasion _ : he always sought collateral aid to the influences of the truth , and sometimes attempted to suborn Nature herself to give effect to his persuasions .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 29]: The text he had chosen was : `` But as the days of Noe were , so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be . ''
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 48]: He made no allusion to the paper which the rain was busy washing off the door of the chapel ; nor did he wish to remind the people that this was the very day foreseen by the bill-sticking prophet , as appointed for the advent of judgment .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 81]: But when , in the middle of the sermon , a flash of lightning seemed to extinguish the array of candles , and was followed by an instant explosion of thunder , and a burst of rain , as if a waterspout had broken over their heads , coming down on the roof like the trampling of horses and the noise of chariot-wheels , the general start and pallor of the congregation showed that they had not forgotten the prediction .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 26]: This then was the way in which judgment was going to be executed : a second flood was about to sweep them from the earth .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 111]: So , although all stared at the minister as if they drank in every word of his representation of Noah 's flood , with its despairing cries , floating carcases , and lingering deaths on the mountain-tops as the water crept slowly up from peak to peak , yet they were much too frightened at the little flood in the valley of two rivers , to care for the terrors of the great deluge of the world , in which , according to Mr Turnbull , eighty thousand millions of the sons and daughters of men perished , or to heed the practical application which he made of his subject .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 16]: For once the contingent of nature was too powerful for the ends of the preacher .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 13]: When the service was over , they rushed out of the chapel .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 17]: Robert Bruce was the first to step from the threshold up to the ankles in water .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 14]: The rain was falling -- not in drops , but in little streams .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 7]: `` The Lord preserve 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 16]: `` It 's risen a fit -LRB- foot -RRB- upo ' Glamerton a ` ready .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 10]: And there 's that sugar i ' the cellar !
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 7]: Bairns , rin hame yer lanes .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 7]: I canna bide for ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 12]: And he was starting off at the top of his speed .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 3]: `` Hoots !
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 36]: man , '' cried Thomas Crann , who came behind him , `` ye 're sae sair ta'en up wi ' the warl , ` at ye hae nae room for ordinar ' common sense .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 49]: Ye 're only stannin ' up to the mou 's o ' yer shune i ' the hole ` at ye unnertook yersel ' to fill up wi ' the lime ` at was ower efter ye had turned yer dry stane dyke intil a byre-wa ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 11]: Robert stepped out of the hole and held his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 15]: At that moment , Annie was slipping past him to run back to Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 13]: He made a pounce upon her and grabbed her by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 10]: `` Nae mair o ' this , Annie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 23]: `` Come hame for cowmon dacency , and dinna gang stravaguin ' in a nicht like this , naebody kens whaur . ''
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 11]: `` A ' body kens whaur , '' returned Annie .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 18]: `` I 'm only gaun to sleep wi ' Tibbie Dyster , puir blin ' body ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 42]: `` Lat the blin ' sleep wi ' the blin ' , an ' come ye hame wi ' me , '' said Robert oracularly , abusing several texts of Scripture in a breath , and pulling Annie away with him .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 19]: `` Ye 'll be drooned afore the mornin ' in some hole or ither , ye fashous rintheroot !
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 13]: And syne wha 'll hae the wyte o ' ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 18]: Heartily vexed and disappointed , Annie made no resistance , for she felt it would be uncomely .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 11]: And how the rain did pour as they went home !
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 37]: They were all wet to the skin in a moment except Mr Bruce , who had a big umbrella , and reasoned with himself that his Sabbath clothes were more expensive than those of the children .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 19]: The best way certainly was to send the wet ones to bed as soon as they got home .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 27]: But how could Annie go to bed when Tibbie was lying awake listening for her footsteps , and hearing only the sounds of the rising water ?
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 9]: She made up her mind what to do .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 19]: Instead of going into her room , she kept listening on the landing for the cessation of footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 29]: The rain poured down on the roof with such a noise , and rushed so fiercely along the spouts , that she found it difficult to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 27]: There was no use in changing her clothes only to get them wet again , and it was well for her that the evening was warm .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 36]: But at length she was satisfied that her gaolers were at supper , whereupon she stole out of the house as quietly as a kitten , and was out of sight of it as quickly .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 8]: Not a creature was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 22]: The gutters were all choked and the streets had become river-beds , already torn with the rush of the ephemeral torrents .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 15]: But through it all she dashed fearlessly , bounding on to Tibbie 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 6]: `` Eh , preserve 's !
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 8]: sic a nicht , Peter Whaup ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 19]: said Peter 's wife to Peter as he sat by the fire with his cutty in his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 10]: `` It 'll be an awfu ' spate . ''
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 10]: `` Ay will ` t , '' rejoined Peter .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 9]: `` There 's mair water nor whusky already .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 8]: Jist rax doon the bottle , gudewife .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 12]: It tak 's a hantle to quawlifee sic weet 's this .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 16]: Tak ' a drappy yersel ' , ` oman , to haud it oot . ''
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 8]: `` Ye hae had plenty , Peter .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 7]: _ I _ dinna want nane .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 19]: Ye 're a true smith , man : ye hae aye a spark i ' yer throat . ''
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 3]: `` Toots !
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 31]: There never was sic a storm o ' water sin ' the ark o ' the covenant -- '' `` Ye mean Noah 's ark , Peter , man . ''
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 5]: `` Weel , weel !
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 4]: onything ye like .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 10]: It 's a ' the same , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 124]: I was only jist remarkin ' that we haena sic a fa ' o ' rain ilka day , an ' we sud jist haud the day in min ' , pay ' t respec ' like , keep it wi ' a tumler , ye ken -- cummummerate it , as they ca ' ` t. Rax doon the bottle , lass , and I 'll jist gie a luik oot an ' see whether the water 's likely to come in ower the door-sill ; for gin it ance crosses the thrashol ' , I doot there wonno be whusky eneuch i ' the hoose , and bein ' the Sawbath nicht , we canna weel win at ony mair . ''
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 10]: Thus entreated , Mistress Whaup got the bottle down .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 32]: She knew her husband must have whisky , and , like a wise woman , got him to take as large a proportion of the immitigable quantity as possible at home .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 8]: Peter went to the door to reconnoitre .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 6]: `` Guid guide 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 28]: he cried ; `` there 's a lassie run by like a maukin -LRB- hare -RRB- , wi ' a splash at ilka fit like a wauk-mill .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 10]: An ' I do believe it was Annie Anderson .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 15]: Will she be rinnin ' for the howdie -LRB- midwife -RRB- to Mistress Bruce ?
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 6]: The cratur 'll be droont .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 8]: I 'll jist rin efter her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 10]: `` An ' be droont yersel , Peter Whaup !
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 15]: She 's a wise lass , an ' can tak care o ' hersel .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 6]: Lat ye her rin . ''
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 4]: But Peter hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 12]: `` The water 's bilin ' , '' cried Mrs Whaup .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 6]: And Peter hesitated no longer .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 12]: Nor indeed could he have overtaken Annie if he had tried .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 38]: Before Peter 's tumbler was mixed she was standing on the stone across the dyer 's _ dam _ , looking down into the water which had risen far up the perpendicular sides of its rocky conduit .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 15]: Across the stone the water from the street above was pouring into the Glamour .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 26]: `` Tibbie , '' she said , as she entered the cottage , `` I doobt there 's gaun to be a terrible spate . ''
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 9]: `` Lot it come , '' cried Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 57]: `` The bit hoosie 's fund ' t upon a rock , and the rains may fa ' , and the wins may blaw , and the floods may ca at the hoosie , but it winna fa ' , it canna fa ' , for it 's fund ' t upo ' a rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 26]: Perhaps Tibbie 's mind was wandering a little , for when Annie entered , she found her face flushed , and her hands moving restlessly .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 29]: But what with this assurance of her confidence , and the pleasure of being with her again , Annie thought no more about the waters of the Glamour .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 10]: `` What keepit ye sae lang , lassie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 25]: said Tibbie wearily after a moment 's silence , during which Annie had been redisposing the peats to get some light from the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 7]: She told her the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 9]: `` And hae ye had nae supper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 3]: `` Na .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 7]: But I dinna want ony . ''
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 15]: `` Pit aff yer weet claes than , and come to yer bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 23]: Annie crept into the bed beside her -- not dry even then , for she was forced to retain her last garment .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 16]: Tibbie was restless , and kept moaning , so that neither of them could sleep .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 21]: And the water kept sweeping on faster , and rising higher up the rocky mound on which the cottage stood .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 13]: The old woman and the young girl lay within and listened fearless .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXIII .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 11]: Alec too lay awake and listened to the untiring rain .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 31]: Weary of the house , he had made use of the missionar kirk to get out of it , and had been one of Mr Turnbull 's congregation that night .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 80]: Partly because his mind was unoccupied by any fear from without , for he only laughed at the prophecy , something in that sermon touched him deeper than any one else in the place perhaps , awoke some old feelings of responsibility that had been slumbering for a long time , and made him reflect upon an unquestioned article of his creed -- the eternal loss and misery and torture of the soul that did not repent and believe .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 24]: At the same time , what repentance and belief really meant -- what he had to do first -- he did not know .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 19]: All he seemed to know was that he was at that moment in imminent danger of eternal damnation .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 34]: And he lay thinking about this while the rain kept pouring upon the roof out of the thick night overhead , and the Glamour kept sweeping by through the darkness to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 16]: He grew troubled , and when at last he fell asleep , he dreamed frightfully .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 16]: When he woke , it was a dull morning , full of mist and rain .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 18]: His dreams had fled even from his memory , but had left a sense of grievous discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 9]: He rose and looked out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 18]: The Glamour spread out and rushed on like the torrent of a sea forsaking its old bed .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 17]: Down its course swept many dark objects , which he was too far off to distinguish .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 25]: He dressed himself , and went down to its edge -- not its bank : that lay far within and far beneath its torrent .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 36]: The water , outspread where it ought not to be , seemed to separate him from the opposite country by an impassable gulf of space , a visible infinitude -- a vague marvel of waters .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 10]: Past him swept trees torn up by the roots .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 16]: Down below , where he could not see , stones were rolling along the channel .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 11]: On the surface , sheaves and trees went floating by .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 21]: Then a cart with a drowned horse between the shafts , heaved past in the central roll of the water .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 10]: Next came something he could not understand at first .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 6]: It was a great water-wheel .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 20]: This made him think of the mill , and he hurried off to see what the miller was doing .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 14]: Truffey went stumping through the rain and the streams to the morning school .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 25]: Gladly would he have waited on the bridge , which he had to cross on his way , to look at the water instead .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 14]: But the master would be there , and Truffey would not be absent .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 15]: When Mr Malison came , Truffey was standing in the rain waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 6]: Not another boy was there .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 5]: He sent him home .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 19]: And Truffey went back to the bridge over the Glamour , and there stood watching the awful river .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 10]: Mr Malison sped away westward towards the Wan Water .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 16]: On his way he found many groups of the inhabitants going in the same direction .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 34]: The bed of the Wan Water was here considerably higher than that of the Glamour , although by a rapid descent it reached the same level a couple of miles below the town .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 34]: But its waters had never , to the knowledge of any of the inhabitants , risen so high as to surmount the ridge on the other slope of which the town was built .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 8]: Consequently they had never invaded the streets .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 40]: But now people said the Wan Water would be down upon them in the course of an hour or two , when Glamerton would be in the heart of a torrent , for the two rivers would be one .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 21]: So instead of going to school , all the boys had gone to look , and the master followed them .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 28]: Nor was the fear without foundation ; for the stream was still rising , and a foot more would overtop the ground between it and the Glamour .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 38]: But while the excited crowd of his townsmen stood in the middle of a stubble-field , watching the progress of the enemy at their feet , Robert Bruce was busy in his cellar preparing for its reception .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 21]: He could not move his cask of sugar without help , and there was none of that to be had .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 47]: Therefore he was now , in his shirt-sleeves , carrying the sugar up the cellar-stairs in the coal-scuttle , while Mrs Bruce , in a condition very unfit for such efforts , went toiling behind him with the _ meal-bossie _ filled far beyond the brim .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 20]: As soon as he had finished his task , he hurried off to join the watchers of the water .
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 11]: James Johnstone 's workshop was not far from the Glamour .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 27]: When he went into it that morning , he found the treadles under water , and thought he had better give himself _ the play _ .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 44]: `` I 'll jist tak a daun ` er -LRB- stroll -RRB- doon to the brig to see the spate gang by , '' he said to himself , and , putting on his grandfather 's hat , went out into the rain .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 19]: As he came near the bridge , he saw cripple Truffey leaning over the parapet with horror-stricken looks .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 30]: The next moment he bounded to his one foot and his crutch , and _ spanged _ over the bridge as if he had been gifted with six legs .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 29]: When James reached the parapet , he could see nothing to account for the terror and eagerness in Truffey 's pale face , nor for his precipitate flight .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 30]: But being short-sighted and inquisitive , he set off after Truffey as fast as the dignity proper to an elderly weaver and a deacon of the missionars would permit .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 25]: As Alec came near the mill he saw two men standing together on the verge of the brown torrent which separated them from it .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 30]: They were the miller -- the same whose millstone Curly had broken by shutting down the sluice -- and Thomas Crann , the latest architect employed about the building .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 28]: Thomas had been up all night , wandering hither and thither along the shore of the Wan Water , sorely troubled about Glamerton and its careless people .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 43]: Towards morning he had found himself in the town again , and , crossing the Glamour , had wandered up the side of the water , and so come upon the sleepless miller contemplating his mill in the embrace of the torrent .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 18]: `` Ye maun alloo it 's _ hard _ , Thamas , '' said the miller . ''
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 5]: _ Hard _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 5]: retorted Thomas with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 9]: `` Hoo daur ye say sic a thing !
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 114]: Here hae ye been stickin ' yer bit water-wheel i ' the mids o ' ane o ' the Lord 's burns , and the Lord has ca 'd it roon and roon for you and yer forbears aboon a hunner yer , and ye 've grun ' yer breid oot o ' ` t , and the breid o ' yer bairns , and noo whan it 's i ' the Lord 's gait , and he maun hae mair room to sen ' doon the waters frae his hills , ye grummle an ' compleen at the spate that 's been foreordee n't frae the verra black mirk o ' eternity .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 41]: What wad ye think o ' a bairn gaein ' compleenin ' o ' you 'cause your backwater had ta'en awa ' his wheelie o ' rashes , whaur it was whurlin ' bonnie afore ye liftit the sluice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 31]: Thomas 's zeal had exposed him to the discomfiture of those who , if they do not actually tell lies for God , yet use very bad arguments for him .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 26]: The miller rejoined : `` You or me , Thomas , wad see bairnie an ' wheelie alike safe , afore we liftit the sluice .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 15]: The Lord _ micht _ hae managed ohn ta'en awa ' my mull . ''
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 12]: `` Yer mull 's nae doon the water yet , Simon .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 24]: It 's in some extremity , I confess ; but whether it 's to be life or deith , none kens but ane .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 17]: Gang hame , man , and gang doon upo ' yer knees , and pray . ''
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 10]: `` Pray to God aboot an auld meal-mull ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 6]: said Simon with indignation . ''
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 10]: ` Deed , I winna be sae ill-bred . ''
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 37]: And so saying , he turned and went home , leaving Thomas muttering -- `` Gin a body wad pray aboot onything , they micht , maybe , tak ' a likin ' till ` t .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 32]: A prayer may do a body guid whan it 's no jist o ' the kin ' to be a ` thegither acceptable to the min ' o ' the Almichty .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 17]: But I doobt his ear 's gleg for ony prayer that gangs up his gait . ''
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 35]: The last two sentences were spoken aloud as he shook hands with Alec , of whose presence he had been aware from the first , although he had taken no notice of his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 19]: Before another word was uttered , their attention was attracted by a large mass floating down the river .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 8]: `` What 's that , Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 3]: said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 42]: `` I houp it winna tak ' awa ' the brig. '' He meant the wooden bridge a few hundred yards below them , which , inaccessible from either side , was now very little above the level of the water .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 19]: `` It 's jist the riggin ' o ' some cottar 's bit hoosie , '' answered Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 17]: `` What 's come o ' them that was aneath it , the Lord only kens .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 9]: The water 's jist liftit the roof bodily .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 15]: There it gangs -- throu ' aneath the brig. -- The brig 's doon .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 5]: It 's no doon .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 9]: -- It 's stan ` in ' yet .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 8]: -- But the puir fowk , Alec !
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 8]: -- Eh , gin they warna preparet !
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 8]: Think o ' that , Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 11]: `` I houp they wan oot , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 14]: `` Houps are feckless things , Alec , '' returned Thomas , censoriously .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 53]: But the talk was turned into another channel by the appearance -- a few ridges off -- for they were standing in a field -- of Truffey , who , with frantic efforts to get on , made but little speed , so deep did his crutch sink in the soaked earth .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 21]: He had to pull it out at every step , and seemed mad in his foiled anxiety to reach them .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 19]: He tried to shout , but nothing was heard beyond a crow like that of a hoarse chicken .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 31]: Alec started off to meet him , but just as he reached him his crutch broke in the earth , and he fell and lay unable to speak a word .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 11]: With slow and ponderous arrival , Thomas Crann came up .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 5]: `` Annie Anderson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 6]: panted out Truffey at length .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 8]: `` What aboot _ her _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 5]: said both in alarm .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 5]: `` Tibbie Dyster ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 5]: sobbed Truffey in reply .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 7]: `` Here 's Jeames Johnstone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 14]: said Thomas ; `` he 'll tell 's a ' aboot it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 26]: He surmised the facts , but waited in painful expectation of assurance from the deacon , who came slipping and sliding along the wet ridges .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 6]: `` What 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 10]: he cried fiercely , as James came within hearing .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 7]: `` What is ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 5]: returned the weaver eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 31]: If Thomas had been a swearing man , what a terrible oath he would have sworn in the wrath which this response of the weaver roused in his apprehensive soul !
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 31]: But Truffey was again trying to speak , and with a `` Be ashamed o ' yersel ' , Jeames Johnstone , '' the mason bent his ear to listen .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 6]: `` They 'll be droont .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 6]: They 'll be taen awa .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 6]: They canna win oot . ''
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 10]: Thomas and Alec turned and stared at each other .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 5]: `` The boat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 3]: gasped Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 5]: Alec made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 9]: That was a terrible water to look at .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 6]: And the boat was small .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 9]: `` Can ye guide it , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 15]: said Thomas , his voice trembling , and the muscles of his face working .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 10]: The terrors of the night had returned upon Alec .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 5]: Would the boat live ?
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 7]: Was there more than a chance ?
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 13]: And if she went down , was he not damned for ever ?
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 5]: He made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 4]: He was afraid .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 4]: `` Alec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 27]: shouted Thomas , in a voice that might have been heard across the roar of the Glamour , `` Will ye lat the women droon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 29]: `` Thomas , '' answered Alec , meekly , trembling from head to foot , `` gin I gang to the boddom , I gang to hell . ''
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 20]: `` Better be damned , doin ' the will o ' God , than saved doin ' noathing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 3]: said Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 8]: The blood shot into Alec 's face .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 5]: He turned and ran .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 37]: `` Thomas , '' said James Johnstone , with shy interposition , laying his forefinger upon the stonemason 's broad chest , `` hae ye considered what ye 're drivin ' the young man till ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 9]: `` Ay , weel eneuch , Jeames Johnstone .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 45]: Ye 're ane o ' thae mealy-mou 'd frien 's that like a man sae wel they wad raither hae him gang wi ' his back to the pleuch , nor ca ' t i ' the face o ' a cauld win ' .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 15]: I wad raither see my frein ' hangt nor see him deserve hangin ' .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 7]: Haud awa ' wi ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 25]: Gin he disna gang , I 'll gang mysel ' , an ' I never was in a boat i ' my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 26]: `` Come awa , Thomas , '' cried Alec , already across three or four ridges ; `` I canna carry her my lane . ''
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 31]: Thomas followed as fast as he could , but before he reached the barn , he met Alec and one of the farm-servants , with the boat on their shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 9]: It was a short way to the water .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 13]: They had her afloat in a few minutes , below the footbridge .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 12]: At the edge the water was as still as a pond .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 12]: Alec seized the oars , and the men shoved him off .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 9]: `` Pray , Alec , '' shouted Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 5]: `` I haena time .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 22]: Pray yersel ' , '' shouted Alec in reply , and gave a stroke that shot him far towards the current .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 16]: Before he reached it , he shifted his seat , and sat facing the bows .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 30]: There was little need for pulling , nor was there much fear of being overtaken by any floating mass , while there was great necessity for looking out ahead .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 58]: The moment Thomas saw the boat laid hold of by the current , he turned his back to the Glamour , fell upon his knees in the grass , and cried in an agony : `` Lord , let not the curse o ' the widow and the childless be upo ' me , Thomas Crann . ''
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 5]: Thereafter he was silent .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 9]: Johnstone and the farm-lad ran down the river-side .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 17]: Truffey had started for the bridge again , having tied up his crutch with a string .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 33]: Thomas remained kneeling , with his arms stretched out as stiff as the poles of a scaffold , and the joints of his clasped fingers buried in the roots of the grass .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 21]: The stone piers of the wooden bridge fell into the water with a rush , but he never heard it .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 14]: The bridge floated past him bodily , but his back was towards it .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 35]: Like a wretch in sanctuary , he dared not leave `` the footstool of grace , '' or expose himself to the inroads of the visible world around him , by opening his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 18]: Alec did not find it so hard as he had expected to keep his boat from capsizing .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 13]: But the rapidity with which the banks swept past him was frightful .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 37]: The cottage lay on the other side of the Glamour , lower down , and all that he had to do for a while , was to keep the bows of his boat down the stream .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 32]: When he approached the cottage , he drew a little out of the centre of the current , which , confined within rising ground , was here fiercer than anywhere above .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 24]: But out of the current he could not go ; for the cottage lay between the channel of the river and the mill-race .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 41]: Except for its relation , however , to the bridge behind it , which he saw crowded with anxious spectators , he would not have known where it ought to be -- so much was the aspect of everything altered .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 26]: He could see that the water was more than half way up the door , right at which he had resolved to send his boat .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 23]: He was doubtful whether the doorway was wide enough to let it through , but he saw no other way of doing .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 30]: He hoped his momentum would be sufficient to force the door open , or , better still , to carry away the posts , and give him more room .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 36]: If he failed no doubt the boat would be in danger , but he would not make any further resolutions , till action , becoming absolute , should reveal the nature of its own necessity .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 44]: As he drew near his mark , therefore , he resumed the seat of a rower , kept taking good aim at the door , gave a few vigorous pulls , and unshipping his oars , bent his head forward from the shock .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 24]: Bang went the _ Bonnie Annie _ ; away went door and posts ; and the lintel came down on Alec 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 15]: But I will now tell how the night had passed with Tibbie and Annie .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXIV .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 17]: Tibbie 's moaning grew gentler and less frequent , and both fell into a troubled slumber .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 12]: From this Annie awoke at the sound of Tibbie 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 7]: She was talking in her dream .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 20]: `` Dinna wauk him , '' she said ; `` dinna wauk him ; he 's fell -LRB- Germ .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 6]: viel -RRB- tired and sleepy .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 8]: Lat the win ' blaw , lads .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 12]: Do ye think He canna see whan his een are steekit .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 21]: Gin the watter meddle wi ' you , He 'll sune lat it ken it 's i ' the wrang .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 14]: Ye 'll see ' t cowerin ' at 's feet like a colley-dog .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 14]: I 'll jist dight the weet aff o ' my Lord 's face .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 9]: -- Weel , wauk him gin ye will .
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 13]: _ I _ wad raither gang to the boddom mysel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 4]: A pause followed .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 21]: It was clear that she was in a dream-boat , with Jesus in the hinder part asleep upon a pillow .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 19]: The sounds of the water outside had stolen through her ears and made a picture in her brain .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 11]: Suddenly she cried out : `` I tellt ye sae !
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 5]: I tellt ye sae !
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 4]: Luik at it !
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 16]: The jaws -LRB- waves -RRB- gang doon as gin they war sae mony wholpies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 8]: She woke with the cry -- weeping .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 31]: `` I thocht _ I _ had the sicht o ' my een , '' she said sobbing , `` and the Lord was blin ' wi ' sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 8]: `` Do you hear the watter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 3]: said Annie .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 10]: `` Wha cares for _ that _ watter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 9]: she answered , in a tone of contempt .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 12]: `` Do ye think He canna manage _ hit _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 18]: But there was a _ jabble _ in the room beside them , and Annie heard it .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 11]: The water was yelping at the foot of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 10]: `` The watter 's i ' the hoose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 11]: cried she , in terror , and proceeded to rise .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 12]: `` Lie still , bairn , '' said Tibbie , authoritatively .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 15]: `` Gin the watter be i ' the hoose , there 's no ootgang .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 9]: It 'll be doon afore the mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 4]: Lie still . ''
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 31]: Annie lay down again , and Tibbie resumed : `` Gin we be i ' the watter , the watter 's i ' the how o ' his han ' .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 37]: Gin we gang to the boddom , he has only to open 's fingers , an ' there we are , lyin ' i ' the loof o ' 's han ' , dry and warm .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 4]: Lie still . ''
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 17]: And Annie lay so still , that in a few minutes more she was asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 4]: Tibbie slept too .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 25]: But Annie woke from a terrible dream -- that a dead man was pursuing her , and had laid a cold hand upon her .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 11]: The dream was gone , but the cold hand remained .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 4]: `` Tibbie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 13]: she cried , `` the watter 's i ' the bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 8]: `` What say ye , lassie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 6]: returned Tibbie , waking up .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 10]: `` The watter 's i ' the bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 6]: `` Weel , lie still .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 7]: We canna sweyp it oot . ''
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 7]: The water was in the bed .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 6]: And it was pitch dark .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 15]: Annie , who lay at the front , stretched her arm over the side .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 6]: It sunk to the elbow .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 14]: In a moment more the bed beneath her was like a full sponge .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 11]: She lay in silent terror , longing for the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 10]: `` I 'm terrible cauld , '' said Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 15]: Annie tried to answer her , but the words would not leave her throat .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 4]: The water rose .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 7]: They were lying half-covered with it .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 5]: Tibbie broke out singing .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 14]: Annie had never heard her sing , and it was not very musical .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 9]: `` Saviour , through the desert lead us .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 8]: Without thee , we can not go .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 8]: Are ye waukin ' , lassie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 7]: `` Ay , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 16]: `` I 'm terrible cauld , an ' the watter 's up to my throat .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 9]: I canna muv , I 'm sae cauld .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 10]: I didna think watter had been sae cauld . ''
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 11]: `` I 'll help ye to sit up a bit .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 41]: Ye 'll hae dreidfu ' rheumatize efter this , Tibbie , '' said Annie , as she got up on her knees , and proceeded to lift Tibbie 's head and shoulders , and draw her up in the bed .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 8]: But the task was beyond her strength .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 29]: She could not move the helpless weight , and , in her despair , she let Tibbie 's head fall back with a dull plash upon the bolster .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 31]: Seeing that all she could do was to sit and support her , she got out of bed and waded across the floor to the fireside to find her clothes .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 5]: But they were gone .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 26]: Chair and all had been floated away , and although she groped till she found the floating chair , she could not find the clothes .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 22]: She returned to the bed , and getting behind Tibbie , lifted her head on her knees , and so sat .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 6]: An awful dreary time followed .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 7]: The water crept up and up .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 20]: Tibbie moaned a little , and then lay silent for a long time , drawing slow and feeble breaths .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 7]: Annie was almost dead with cold .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 16]: Suddenly in the midst of the darkness Tibbie cried out , `` I see licht !
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 5]: I see licht ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 15]: A strange sound in her throat followed , after which she was quite still .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 7]: Annie 's mind began to wander .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 14]: Something struck her gently on the arm , and kept bobbing against her .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 11]: She put out her hand to feel what it was .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 6]: It was round and soft .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 28]: She said to herself : `` It 's only somebody 's heid that the water 's torn aff , '' and put her hand under Tibbie again .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 11]: In the morning she found it was a drowned hen .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 9]: At length she saw motion rather than light .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 16]: The first of the awful dawn was on the yellow flood that filled the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 7]: There it lay throbbing and swirling .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 4]: The light grew .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 10]: She strained her eyes to see Tibbie 's face .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 27]: At last she saw that the water was over her mouth , and that her face was like the face of her father in his coffin .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 12]: Child as she was , she knew that Tibbie was dead .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 17]: She tried notwithstanding to lift her head out of the water , but she could not .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 18]: So she crept from under her , with painful effort , and stood up in the bed .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 7]: The water almost reached her knees .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 8]: The table was floating near the bed .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 20]: She got hold of it , and scrambling on to it , sat with her legs in the water .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 34]: For another long space , half dead and half asleep , she went floating about , dreaming that she was having a row in the _ Bonnie Annie _ with Alec and Curly .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 25]: In the motions of the water , she had passed close to the window looking down the river , and Truffey had seen her .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 18]: Wide awake she started from her stupor at the terrible bang with which the door burst open .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 21]: She thought the cottage was falling , and that her hour was come to follow Tibbie down the dark water .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 25]: But in shot the sharp prow of the _ Bonnie Annie _ , and in glided after it the stooping form of Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 10]: She gave one wailing cry , and forgot everything .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 14]: That cry however had not ceased before she was in Alec 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 21]: In another moment , wrapt in his coat and waistcoat , she was lying in the bottom of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 31]: Alec was now as cool as any hero should be , for he was doing his duty , and had told the devil to wait a bit with his damnation .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 17]: He looked all about for Tibbie , and at length spied her drowned in her bed .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 12]: `` So much the more chance for Annie and me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 11]: `` But I wish I had been in time . ''
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 7]: What was to be done next ?
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 22]: Down the river he must go , and they would be upon the bridge in two moments after leaving the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 14]: -- He must shoot the middle arch , for that was the highest .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 46]: But if he escaped being dashed against the bridge before he reached the arch , and even had time to get in a straight line for it , the risk was a terrible one , with the water within a few feet of the keystone .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 38]: But when he shot the _ Bonnie Annie _ again through the door of the cottage , neither arch nor bridge was to be seen , and the boat went down the open river like an arrow .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXV .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 23]: Alec , looking down the river on his way to the cottage , had not seen the wooden bridge floating after him .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 14]: As he turned to row into the cottage , it went past him .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 57]: The stone bridge was full of spectators , eagerly watching the boat , for Truffey had spread the rumour of the attempt ; while the report of the situation of Tibbie and Annie having reached even the Wan Water , those who had been watching it were now hurrying across to the bridge of the Glamour .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 25]: The moment Alec disappeared in the cottage , some of the spectators caught sight of the wooden bridge coming down full tilt upon them .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 72]: Already fears for the safety of the stone bridge had been openly expressed , for the weight of water rushing against it was tremendous ; and now that they saw this ram coming down the stream , a panic , with cries and shouts of terror , arose , and a general rush left the bridge empty just at the moment when the floating mass struck one of the principal piers .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 13]: Had the spectators remained upon it , the bridge might have stood .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 21]: But one of the crowd was too much absorbed in watching the cottage to heed the sudden commotion around him .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 34]: This was Truffey , who , leaning wearily on the parapet with his broken crutch looking over it also at his side , sent his soul through his eyes to the cottage window .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 29]: Even when the bridge struck the pier , and he must have felt the mass on which he stood tremble , he still kept staring at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 21]: Not till he felt the bridge begin to sway , I presume , had he a notion of his danger .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 11]: Then he sprang up , and made for the street .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 18]: The half of the bridge crumbled away behind him , and vanished in the seething yellow abyss .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 17]: At this moment , the first of the crowd from the Wan Water reached the bridge-foot .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 6]: Amongst them came the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 10]: Truffey was making desperate efforts to reach the bank .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 14]: His mended crutch had given way , and he was hopping wildly along .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 12]: Murdoch Malison saw him , and rushed upon the falling bridge .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 47]: He reached the cripple , caught him up in his strong arms , turned and was half way to the street , when with a swing and a sweep and a great plash , the remaining half of the bridge reeled into the current and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 15]: Murdoch Malison and Andrew Truffey left the world each in the other 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 6]: Their bodies were never found .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 31]: A moment after the fall of the bridge , Robert Bruce , gazing with the rest at the triumphant torrent , saw the _ Bonnie Annie _ go darting past .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 20]: Alec was in his shirt-sleeves , facing down the river , with his oars level and ready to dip .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 13]: But Bruce did not see Annie in the bottom of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 20]: `` I wonner hoo auld Marget is , '' he said to his wife the moment he reached home .
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 8]: But his wife could not tell him .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 9]: Then he turned to his two younger children .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 13]: `` Bairns , '' he said , `` Annie Anderson 's droont .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 19]: Ay , she 's droont , '' he continued , as they stared at him with frightened faces .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 19]: `` The Almichty 's taen vengeance upon her for her disobedience , and for brackin ' the Sawbath .
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 28]: See what ye 'll come to , bairns , gin ye tak up wi ' ill loons , and dinna min ' what 's said to ye .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 12]: _ She 's _ come to an ill hinner-en ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 6]: Mrs Bruce cried a little .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 23]: Robert would have set out at once to see Margaret Anderson , but there was no possibility of crossing the Wan Water .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 32]: Fortunately for Thomas Crann , James Johnstone , who had reached the bridge just before the alarm arose , sped to the nearest side , which was that away from Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 29]: So , having seen the boat go past , with Alec still safe in it , he was able to set off with the good news for Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 33]: After searching for him at the miller 's and at Howglen , he found him where he had left him , still on his knees , with his hands in the grass .
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 13]: `` Alec 's a ' safe , man , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 13]: Thomas fell on his face , and he thought he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 8]: But he was only giving lowlier thanks .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 11]: James took hold of him after a moment 's pause .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 34]: Thomas rose from the earth , put his great horny hand , as a child might , into that of the little weaver , and allowed him to lead him whither he would .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 13]: He was utterly exhausted , and it was hours before he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 7]: There was no getting to Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 23]: So James took him to the miller 's for shelter and help , but said nothing about how he had found him .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 15]: The miller made Thomas drink a glass of whisky and get into his bed .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 24]: `` I saw ye , Thamas , upo ' yer knees , '' said he ; `` but I dauredna come near ye .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 13]: Put in a word for me , neist time , man . ''
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 6]: Thomas made him no reply .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 24]: Down the Glamour and down the Wan-Water , for the united streams went by the latter name , the terrible current bore them .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 34]: Nowhere could Alec find a fit place to land , till they came to a village , fortunately on the same side as Howglen , into the street of which the water flowed .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 34]: He bent to his oars , got out of the current , and rowed up to the door of a public-house , whose fat kind-hearted landlady had certainly expected no guests that day .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 24]: In a few minutes Annie was in a hot bath , and before an hour had passed , was asleep , breathing tranquilly .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 22]: Alec got his boat into the coach-house , and hiring a horse from the landlord , rode home to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 22]: She had heard only a confused story , and was getting terribly anxious about him , when he made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 36]: As soon as she learned that he had rescued Annie , and where he had left her , she had Dobbin put to the gig , and drove off to see after her neglected favourite .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 13]: From the moment the bridge fell , the flood began to subside .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 50]: Tibbie 's cottage did not fall , and those who entered , the next day , found her body lying in the wet bed , its face still shining with the reflex of the light which broke upon her spirit as the windows were opened for it to pass .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 21]: `` See sees noo , '' said Thomas Crann to James Johnstone , as they walked together at her funeral .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 15]: `` The Lord sent that spate to wash the scales frae her een . ''
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 17]: Mrs Forbes brought Annie home to Howglen as soon as she was fit to be moved .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 16]: Alec went to town again , starting a week before the commencement of the session .
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXVI .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 25]: It was on a bright frosty evening in the end of October , that Alec entered once more the streets of the great city .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 31]: The stars were brilliant over-head , the gems in Orion 's baldric shining oriently , and the Plough glittering with frost in the cold blue fields of the northern sky .
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 48]: Below , the streets shone with their own dim stars ; and men and women wove the web of their life amongst them as they had done for old centuries , forgetting those who had gone before , and careless of those who were to come after .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 21]: The moment he had succeeded in satisfying his landlady 's inquisition , he rushed up to Mr Cupples 's room .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 5]: Mr Cupples was out .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 6]: What was Alec to do ?
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 37]: He could not call on Mr Fraser that night ; and all space between him and Kate growing more immeasurable the nearer he came to her , he could not rest for the feeling of distance .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 17]: So he wandered out , and along the sea-shore till under the wall of the pier .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 13]: The tide was low , and the wall high over his head .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 19]: He followed it to the edge of the water , and gazed out over the dim lead-coloured sea .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 51]: While he stood thus , he thought he heard voices in the air , and looking up , saw , far over him , on the top of the wall , two heads standing out against the clear sky , one in a bonnet , the other in a Glengarry .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 10]: Why should he feel a pang in his heart ?
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 16]: Surely there were many girls who took starlight walks on that refuge in the sea .
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 14]: And a Glengarry was no uncommon wear for the youths of the city .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 34]: He laughed at his own weak fancies , turned his back on the pier , and walked along the shore towards the mouth of the other river which flowed into the same bay .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 22]: As he went , he glanced back towards the top of the wall , and saw the outline of the man .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 7]: He was in full Highland dress .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 18]: The woman he could not see , for she was on the further side of her companion .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 16]: By the time he was halfway to the college , he had almost forgotten them .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 10]: It was a desolate shore along which he walked .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 15]: Two miles of sand lay by the lip of the sea on his right .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 23]: On his left rose irregular and changeful mounds of dry sand , upon which grew coarse grass and a few unpleasant-looking plants .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 24]: From the level of the tops of these mounds stretched away a broad expanse of flat uncultivated ground , covered with thin grass .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 35]: This space had been devoted , from time immemorial , to the sports of the city , but at this season , and especially at this hour , it was void as the Sahara .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 52]: After sauntering along for half an hour , now listening to the wind that blew over the sand-hills , and now watching the spiky sparkle of the wintry stars in the sea , he reached a point whence he could descry the windows of Mr Fraser 's part of the college .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 9]: There was no light in Kate 's window .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 21]: She must be in the dining-room with her uncle -- or -- or -- on the pier -- with whom ?
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 7]: He flung himself on the sand .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 23]: All the old despair of the night of thunder , of the moonlight ramble , of the last walk together , revived .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 29]: He dug with his fingers into the sand ; and just so the horrible pain was digging , like a live creature with claws , into his heart .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 18]: But Kate was indeed sitting quietly with her uncle , while he lay there on the sea-shore .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 10]: Time passes quickly in any torment -- merciful provision .
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 11]: Suddenly something cold seemed to grasp him by the feet .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 5]: He started and rose .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 16]: Like a wild beast in the night , the tide had crept up upon him .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 26]: A horror seized him , as if the ocean were indeed a slimy monster that sought to devour him where he lay alone and wretched .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 33]: He sprang up the sand before him , and , sliding back at every step , gained the top with difficulty , and ran across the _ links _ towards the city .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 22]: The exercise pumped the blood more rapidly through his brain , and before he reached home hope had begun to dawn .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 14]: He ascended the garret-stairs , and again knocked at Mr Cupples 's door .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 14]: `` Come in , '' reached his ear in a strange dull tone .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 25]: Mr Cupples had shouted into his empty tumbler while just going to swallow the last few drops without the usual intervention of the wine-glass .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 21]: Alec hesitated , but the voice came again with its usual ring , tinged with irritation , and he entered .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 6]: `` Hillo , bantam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 32]: exclaimed Mr Cupples , holding out a grimy hand , that many a lady might have been pleased to possess and keep clean and white : `` Hoo 's the soo ?
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 11]: And hoo 's a ' the cocks and hens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 7]: `` Brawly , '' returned Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 10]: `` Hoo 's the _ tappit hen _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 17]: -- a large bottle , holding six quarts , in which Mr Cupples kept his whisky .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 21]: Mr Cupples opened his eyes wide , and stared at Alec , who saw that he had made a blunder .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 16]: `` I 'll hae nae jaw frae you , younker , '' said he slowly .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 38]: `` Gin ye be sae ill at ease ` at ye maun tak ' leeberties for the sake o ' bein ' facetious , ye can jist gang doon the stair wi ' a quaiet sough . ''
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 21]: `` I beg your pardon , Mr Cupples , '' said Alec earnestly , for he was vexed with himself .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 15]: `` But ye 're quite richt ; I am some ill at ease . ''
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 6]: `` I thocht as muckle .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 13]: Is the rainbow beginnin ' to cast -LRB- fade -RRB- a wee ?
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 19]: Has the fit o ' Iris ca 'd a hole i ' the airch o ' ` t ?
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 4]: Eh , man !
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 2]: man !
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 43]: Tak ' to the mathemawtics and the anawtomy , and fling the conic sections an ' the banes i ' the face o ' the bonny jaud -- Iris , I mean , man , no ither , lass or leddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 23]: For Mr Cupples had feared , from the expression of Alec 's face , that he had given him offence in return .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 13]: A silence of a few seconds followed , which Alec gladly broke .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 12]: `` Are you still acting as librarian , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 3]: `` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 14]: I 'm actin ' _ as _ librarian , '' returned Cupples dryly .
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 42]: `` And I 'm thinkin ' , '' he added , `` that the buiks are beginnin ' to ken by this time what they 're aboot ; for sic a throuither disjaskit midden o ' lere , I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 24]: Ye micht hae taicklet it wi ' a graip '' -LRB- _ a three-pronged fork _ , a sort of agricultural trident -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 17]: `` Are ye gaun to tak ' the cheemistry alang wi ' the naiteral philoasophy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 4]: `` Ay . ''
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 15]: `` Weel , ye jist come to me , as ye hae done afore .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 35]: I 'm no sae gude at thae things as I am at the Greek ; but I ken mair already nor ye 'll ken whan ye ken a ' ` at ye will ken .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 14]: And that 's nae flattery either to you or me , man . ''
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 27]: With beating heart , Alec knocked the next day at Mr Fraser 's door , and was shown into the drawing-room , where sat Kate alone .
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 24]: The moment he saw her , he knew that there was a gulf between them as wide as the Glamour in a spate .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 83]: She received him kindly , nor was there anything in her manner or speech by which he could define an alteration ; and yet , with that marvellous power of self-defence , that instinctive knowledge of spirituo-military engineering with which maidens are gifted , she had set up such a palisade between them , dug such a fosse , and raised such a rampart , that without knowing how the effect was produced , he felt that he could not approach her .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 20]: It is strange how women can put out an invisible arm and push one off to an infinite removal .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 15]: With a miserable sense of cold exhaustion and aching disappointment , he left her .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 34]: She shook hands with him warmly , was very sorry her uncle was out , and asked him whether he would not call again to-morrow , when he would certainly be at home ?
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 31]: He thanked her in a voice that seemed to him not his own , while her voice appeared to him to come out of some far-off cave of the past .
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 19]: The cold frosty air received him as he stepped from the door , and its breath was friendly .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 36]: If the winter would only freeze him to one of its icicles , and still that heart of his which would go on throbbing although there was no reason for it to throb any more !
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 14]: Yet had he not often found her different from what he had expected ?
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 13]: And might not this be only one of her many changeful moods ?
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 2]: Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 69]: So feeling that he had nothing to do and only one thing to think about , he wandered further through the old burgh , past the lingering fragment of its once mighty cathedral , and down to the bridge which , with its one Gothic arch as old as the youth of Chaucer , spanned the channel , here deep and narrow , of the long-drawn Highland river .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 13]: Beyond it lay wintry woods , clear-lined against the pale blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 28]: Into these he wandered , and was going on , seeing nothing , thinking nothing , almost feeling nothing , when he heard a voice behind him .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 6]: `` Hillo , bantam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 15]: it cried ; and Alec did not need to turn to know who called .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 43]: `` I saw ye come oot o ' Professor Fraser 's , '' said Cupples , `` and I thocht a bit dauner i ' the caller air wad do me no ill ; sae I jist cam ' efter ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 21]: Then changing his tone , he added , `` Alec , man , haud a grip o ' yersel ' .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 15]: Dinna tyne that Lowse onything afore ye lowse haud o ' yersel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 10]: `` What do you mean , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 10]: asked Alec , not altogether willing to understand him .
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 9]: `` Ye ken weel eneuch what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 8]: There 's a trouble upo ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 8]: I 'm no speirin ' ony questons .
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 10]: But jist haud a grip o ' yersel ' .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 2]: Rainbows !
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 2]: Rainbows !
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 25]: -- We 'll jist hae a walk thegither , an ' I 'll instruck ye i ' the first prenciples o ' naiteral philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 60]: -- First , ye see , there 's the attraction o ' graivitation , and syne there 's the attraction o ' cohesion , and syne there 's the attraction o ' adhesion ; though I 'm thinkin ' , i ' the lang run , they 'll be a ' fun ' to be ane and the same .
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 22]: And syne there 's the attraction o ' affeenity , whilk differs mair nor a tae 's length frae the lave .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 73]: In hit , ye see , ae thing taks till anither for a whilie , and hauds gey and sicker till ` t , till anither comes ` at it likes better , whaurupon there 's a proceedin ' i ' the Chancery o ' Natur -- only it disna aye haud lang , and there 's nae lawyers ' fees -- and the tane 's straughtways divorced frae the tither . ''
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 47]: And so he went on , giving a kind of humorous travesty of a lecture on physics , which , Alec could not help perceiving , glanced every now and then at his mental condition , especially when it came to treat of the mechanical powers .
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 19]: It was evident that the strange being had some perception of the real condition of Alec 's feelings .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 16]: After walking a couple of miles into the open country , they retraced their footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 23]: As they approached the college , Mr Cupples said : `` Noo , Alec , ye maun gang hame to yer denner .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 7]: I 'll be hame afore nicht .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 27]: And gin ye like , ye can come wi ' me to the library the morn , and I 'll gie ye something to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 57]: Glad of anything to occupy his thoughts , Alec went to the library the next day ; and as Mr Cupples was making a catalogue , and at the same time a thorough change in the arrangement of the books -- both to be after his own heart -- he found plenty for him to do .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 11]: Alec soon found his part in the catalogue-work becoming agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 33]: But although there was much to be done as well in mending old covers , mounting worn title-pages , and such like , in this department Mr Cupples would accept no assistance .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 40]: Indeed if Alec ventured to take up a book destined for repair , he would dart at him an anxious , almost angry glance , and keep watching him at uneasy intervals till he had laid it down again .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 23]: Books were Mr Cupples 's gold and jewels and furniture and fine clothes , in fact his whole _ gloria mundi _ .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 16]: But the opening day was at hand , after which Alec would have less time .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 54]: Still he resolved , as some small return for the kindness of Mr Cupples , that he would continue to give him what help he could ; for he had discovered that the pro-librarian lived in continual dread lest the office should be permanently filled before he had completed his labour of re-organization .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 25]: During the few days passed in the library , he called once upon Mr Fraser , and met with a warm reception from him .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 24]: Kate gave him a kind one as before ; but he had neither the satisfaction nor the pain of being alone with her .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 36]: At the opening , appeared amongst the rest Patrick Beauchamp -- claiming now the name and dignity of The Mac Chattachan , for his grandfather was dead , and he was heir to the property .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 62]: He was , if possible , more haughty than before ; but students are not , as a class , ready to respond to claims of superiority upon such grounds as he possessed , and , except by a few who were naturally obsequious , he continued to be called Beauchamp , and by that name I shall call him too .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 24]: It soon came out that when lecture-hours were over , he put off his lowland dress , and went everywhere in Highland costume .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 46]: Indeed on the first day Alec met him in the gloaming thus attired ; and the flash of his cairngorms as he passed seemed to scorch his eyes , for he thought of the two on the pier , and the miserable hour that followed .
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 34]: Beauchamp no longer attended the anatomical lectures ; and when Alec observed his absence , he recalled the fact that Kate could never bear even a distant reference to that branch of study .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 32]: Whether he would have gone in for it with any heartiness himself this session , had it not been for the good influence of Mr Cupples , is more than doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 36]: But he gave him constant aid , consisting in part of a liberal use of any kind of mental goad that came to his hand -- sometimes praise , sometimes rebuke , sometimes humorous execration .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 49]: Fortunately for the designs of Beauchamp , Mr Fraser had been visiting in his mother 's neighbourhood ; and nothing was easier for one who , like most Celts , possessed more than the ordinary power of ingratiating , than to make himself agreeable to the old man .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 40]: When he took his leave to return to the college , Mr Fraser declared himself sorry that he had made no better acquaintance with him before , and begged that he would call upon him when he came up .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXVII .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 34]: Soon after the commencement of the session , a panic seized the townspeople in consequence of certain reports connected with the school of anatomy , which stood by itself in a low neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 44]: They were to the effect that great indignities were practised upon the remains of the _ subjects _ , that they were huddled into holes about the place , and so heedlessly , that dogs might be seen tearing portions from the earth .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 32]: What truth there may have been at the root of these reports , I can not tell ; but it is probable they arose from some culpable carelessness of the servants .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 27]: At all events , they were believed in the neighbourhood , occupied by those inhabitants of the city readiest to receive and dwell upon anything revolting .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 54]: But what pushed the indignation beyond the extreme of popular endurance , was a second rumour , in the consternation occasioned by which the whole city shared : the _ resurrectionists _ were at their foul work , and the graveyard , the place of repose , was itself no longer a sanctuary !
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 38]: Whether the authorities of the medical school had not been guilty of indifference , contenting themselves with asking no questions about the source whence the means of prosecuting their art was derived , may be a question .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 88]: But fear altogether outstripped investigation , and those even who professed unbelief , took precautions ; whence the lights of the watchers of the dead might be seen twinkling , far into the morning , in the solemn places around the city churches ; while many a poor creature who would have sold his wife 's body for five pounds , was ready to tear a medical student to pieces on the mere chance that his scalpel had touched a human form stolen from the sacred enclosure .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 37]: Now whether Beauchamp , who had watched Alec in the same situation before , had anything to do with what follows I can not tell ; but his conduct then lays him open to suspicion now .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 34]: Alec , who found some escape if not relief from painful thought in the prosecution of his favourite study , was thus occupied one evening , no very unfrequent occurrence , by candlelight .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 25]: He had almost reached a final understanding of the point in pursuit , when he was roused from his absorption by a yell outside .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 21]: He had for some time previous heard a sound of gathering commotion , but had paid no attention to it .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 44]: He started up from his stooping posture , and having blown out his candle , perceived by the lamps outside , that a crowd of faces , pale in the darkness , was staring through the high iron palisade which surrounded the school .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 15]: They had seen his light , and were now watching for his coming out .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 40]: He knew that upon the smallest additional excitement the locked gates and palisade would not keep them off more than half a minute ; so he instantly barred the shutters , and betook himself to the porter 's room .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 43]: As he crossed the small open corner between the two doors , he heard the _ sough _ of their angry speech swelling and falling like a wind in the upper regions of the night ; but they did not see him .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 25]: Fortunately , there was a side door in the railing , seldom used , of which the key hung in the porter 's room .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 12]: By this door Alec let himself out , and relocked it .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 38]: But the moment he turned to go home , he heard an urchin , who had peeped round a corner , screech to the crowd across the enclosure : `` He 's oot at the back yett !
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 12]: He 's oot at the back yett and awa ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 11]: Another yell arose , and the sounds of trampling feet .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 17]: Alec knew that his only chance lay in his heels , and took to them faithfully .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 9]: Behind him came the crowd in hot pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 10]: The narrow streets rang with their shouts of execration .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 10]: Such curses could hardly be heard elsewhere in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 21]: Alec , knowing most of the courts and passages , doubled on his pursuers in the hope of eluding them .
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 67]: But discovering that he had his instrument still in his hand , he stopped to put it down the bars of a grating , for a cut from it would have been most perilous , as he had been using it a day too soon ; and before he had gained another turning , his pursuers were on his track and had caught sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 34]: But Alec 's wind and muscles were both good ; and in five minutes more he was at the back entrance to his own lodging , having left the mob far behind him .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 52]: He darted up to Mr Cupples , and as soon as he found breath enough , told him his adventure , saying with a laugh , as he concluded , `` It 's a mercy there 's as muckle o ' me to the fore as can tell the tale ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 37]: `` Jist tak ' ye tent , bantam , '' returned Mr Cupples , who had suddenly assumed a listening attitude , with his head on one side , `` or ye mayna tell the neist .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 3]: Hark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 14]: From far below arose the dull sound of many feet on the stone-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 24]: Mr Cupples listened for a moment as if fascinated , then turning quietly in his chair , put the poker in the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 3]: Alec rose .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 8]: `` Sit down , you fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 7]: cried Cupples ; and Alec obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 15]: By this time the mob was thundering at the door of the flat below .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 16]: And the fact that they knew where Alec lived adds to my suspicion of Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 19]: The landlady wisely let them in , and for a few minutes they were busy searching the rooms .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 43]: Then the noise of their feet was heard on the wooden stair leading up to the garret , whereupon Mr Cupples turned the poker in the fire , and said to Alec , `` Rin into that hole there , direckly . ''
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 31]: He pointed with the red-hot poker to the door already mentioned as partly sunk in the slope of the ceiling , and then stuck the poker in the fire again .
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 13]: Alec pulled the door open , and entering closed it behind him .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 36]: The next moment , guided by the light from under it , the foremost footsteps reached the door , and the same instant Mr Cupples appeared in it with his glowing weapon in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 10]: Faces with flashing eyes filled the dark garret outside .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 7]: `` What do ye want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 4]: asked Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 27]: `` We want a resurrectioner ` at bides i ' this hoose -- a foul bane-pikin ' doctor , '' answered a huge , black-faced smith .
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 12]: `` What do ye want wi ' _ him _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 15]: `` What are _ ye _ stan ` in ' jawin ' there for ?
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 7]: Haud oot o ' the gait .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 20]: Gin he bena in your box , what 's the odds o ' oor luikin ' i n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 54]: `` Haud a quaiet sough , my man , '' answered Cupples , raising the point of the worn old weapon , the fervency of whose whiteness had already dimmed to a dull scaly red , `` or I s ' lat ye ken ' at I 'm i ' my ain hoose .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 3]: My certy !
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 19]: but this 'll gang throu ye as gin ye war sae mony kegs o ' saut butter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 33]: And he gave a flourish with his rapier -- the crowd yielding a step before it -- as he asked once more -- `` What do ye want wi ' him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 26]: `` To ca the sowl oot o ' the wame o ' the deil 's buckie o ' him , '' said a limping ostler .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 38]: `` I s ' pang the mou ' o ' him wi ' the hip o ' a corp , '' cried a pale-faced painter , who seemed himself to belong to the injured fraternity of corpses .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 25]: A volley of answers too horrible for record , both in themselves and in the strange devilry of their garnish of oaths , followed .
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 11]: Mr Cupples did not flinch a step from his post .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 27]: his fiery sword had by this time darkened into an iron poker , and the might of its enchantment vanished as the blackness usurped its glow .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 78]: He was just going to throw it away , and was stretching out his other hand for his grandfather 's broadsword , which he had put in the corner by the door ready to replace it , when a long arm , with a fist at the end of it , darted from between the heads in front of him , hurled him across the room , and laid him bleeding and senseless on his own hearth .
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 10]: The poker flew from his hand as he fell .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 41]: The crowd rushed in after him , upset his table , broke open the door that protected his precious books , and with one vigorous kick from the blacksmith 's apprentice , sent in the door of Alec 's retreat .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 19]: But at that moment Alec was contemplating the crowd below from a regal seat between two red chimney-pots .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 35]: For as soon as he had drawn-to the door of the closet , instead of finding darkness , he became aware of moonshine , coming through a door that led out upon the roof .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 25]: This he managed to open , and found himself free of the first floor of the habitable earth , the cat-walk of the world .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 31]: As steady in foot and brain as any sailor , he scrambled up the roof , seated himself as I have said , and gave himself up to the situation .
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 18]: A sort of stubby underwood of chimney-pots grew all about him out of red and blue ridges .
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 44]: Above him the stars shone dim in the light of the moon , which cast opal tints all around her on the white clouds ; and beneath him was a terrible dark abyss , full of raging men , dimly lighted with lamps .
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 19]: Cavernous clefts yawned in all directions , in the side of which lived men and women and children .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 10]: What a seething of human emotions was down there !
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 30]: Would they ever be sublimed out of that torture-pit into the pure air of the still heaven , in which the moon rode like the very throne of peace ?
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 25]: Alec had gone through enough of trouble already to be able to feel some such passing sympathy for the dwellers in the city below .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 17]: But the sounds of search in the closet recalled him to a sense of his position .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 16]: If his pursuers looked out at the door , they would see him at once .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 36]: He was creeping round to the other side of the chimney to cower in its shadow , when a sudden bellow from the street apprized him that the movement had discovered him to the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 28]: Presently stones came flying about the chimneys , and a busy little demon bounded into the house to tell the ringleaders that he was on the roof .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 28]: He therefore slid down the slope away from the street , and passed on to the roof of the next house , and thence to the third .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 28]: Arriving at a dingy dormer window , he found that it opened with ease , admitting him into a little room crowded with dusty books and cobwebs .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 23]: He knew then that he was in the territorial outskirts of a certain second-hand bookseller , with whom he had occasional dealings .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 15]: He closed the window , and sat down upon a pile of neglected volumes .
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 25]: The moon shining through the clouded window revealed rows of books all about him , of which he could not read even the names .
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 15]: But he was in no want of the interest they might have afforded him .
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 6]: His thoughts turned to Kate .
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 28]: She always behaved to him so that he felt both hurt and repelled , and found it impossible to go to her so often as he would .
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 53]: Yet now when seated in the solitude of this refuge , his thoughts went back to her tenderly ; for to her they always returned like birds to their tree , from all the regions whither the energetic dispersion of Mr Cupples might have scattered them for their pickings of intellectual crumbs .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 23]: Now , however , it was but as to a leafless wintry tree , instead of a nest bowered in green leaves .
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 47]: Yet he was surprised to find that he was not ten times more miserable ; the fact being that , as he had no reason to fear that she preferred any one else , there was plenty of moorland space left for Hope to grow upon .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 13]: And Alec 's was one of those natures that sow Hope everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 9]: All that such need is room to sow .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 8]: Take that away and they are desperate .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 19]: Alec did not know what advantage Beauchamp had been taking of the Professor 's invitation to visit him .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 24]: After a time the tumult in the street gradually died away , and Alec thought he might venture to return to Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 22]: Clambering back over the roofs , he entered , and found the inner door of the closet broken from its hinges .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 20]: As he moved it aside , a cry of startled fear discovered that his landlady was in the room .
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 9]: `` Guid preserve 's , Mr Forbes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 25]: she cried ; `` whaur come ye frae , and what hae ye been aboot , to raise the haill toon upo ' ye ?
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 16]: I trust ye hae nae legs or airms o ' a cauld corp aboot ye .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 11]: The fowk i ' the back streets canna bide that .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 12]: An ' I winna alloo ' t i ' my hoose .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 9]: Jist luik at puir Mr Cupples here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 16]: Mr Cupples lay on the bed , with his head bound in a bloody bandage .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 16]: He had fallen upon the fender , and a bad cut had been the consequence .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 26]: He held out his hand to Alec , and said feebly , `` Bantam , I thocht ye had yer neck thrawn or this time .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 6]: Hoo , the muckle deil !
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 10]: did ye win oot o ' their grips ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 13]: `` By playin ' the cat a wee , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 27]: `` It 's the first time , '' remarked Mr Cupples , `` I ever kent I had a door to the lift -LRB- sky -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 3]: But faith !
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 21]: the sowl o ' me was nearhan ' gaein ' out at this new ane i ' my ain riggin .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 42]: Gin it hadna been for the guidwife here , ` at cam ' up , efter the clanjamfrie had taen themsel 's aff , an ' fand me lying upo ' the hearthstane , I wad hae been deid or noo .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 10]: Was my heid aneath the grate , guidwife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 19]: `` Na , nae freely that , Mr Cupples ; but the blude o ' ' t was .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 12]: And ye maun jist haud yer tongue , and lie still .
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 25]: Mr Forbes , ye maun jist come doon wi ' me ; for he winna haud 's tongue 's lang 's ye 're there .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 14]: I 'll jist mak ' a cup o ' tay till him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 5]: `` Tay , guidwife !
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 8]: Deil slocken himsel ' wi yer tay !
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 12]: Gie me a sook o ' the tappit hen . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 20]: ` Deed , Mr Cupples , ye s ' hae neither sook nor sipple o ' that spring . ''
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 6]: `` Ye rigwiddie carlin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 4]: grinned the patient .
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 16]: `` Gin ye dinna haud yer tongue , I 'll gang for the doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 9]: `` I 'll fling him doon the stair .
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 7]: -- Here 's doctor eneuch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 7]: he added , looking at Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 10]: `` Gie me half a glaiss , nate . ''
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 17]: `` Never a glaiss nor glaiss sall ye hae frae my han ' , Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 9]: It wad be the deid o ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 16]: And forbye , thae ill-faured gutter-partans -LRB- kennel-crabs -RRB- toomed the pig afore they gaed .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 4]: And guid faith !
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 9]: it was the only wise-like thing they did .
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 28]: Fess the twa halves o ' ` t , Mr Forbes , an ' lat him see ' t wi ' the een o ' misbelief . ''
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 27]: `` Gang oot o ' my chaumer wi ' yer havers , '' cried Mr Cupples , `` and lea ' me wi ' Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 11]: He winna deave me wi ' his clash . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 13]: ` Deed , I 'll no lea ' twa sic fules thegither .
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 10]: Come doon the stair direckly , Mr Forbes . ''
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 9]: Alec saw that it was better to obey .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 28]: He went up on the sly in the course of the evening , however , but peeping in and seeing that he slept , came down again .
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 24]: He insisted upon sitting up with him though , to which , after repeated vows of prudence and caution , their landlady consented .
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 9]: He was restless and feverish during the night .
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 6]: Alec gave him some water .
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 5]: He drank it eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 18]: A flash of his humour broke through the cloud of his suffering as he returned the tumbler .
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 5]: `` Eh , man !
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 10]: that 's gran ' tipple , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 10]: `` Hoo do ye ca ' ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 13]: In the morning he was better ; but quite unable to rise .
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 24]: The poor fellow had very little blood for ordinary organic purposes , and the loss of any was a serious matter to him .
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 13]: `` I canna lift my heid , Alec , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 25]: `` Gin that thrawn wife wad hae but gien me a drappy o ' whusky , I wad hae been a ' richt . ''
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 13]: `` Jist lie ye still , Mr Cupples , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 10]: `` I winna gang to the class the day .
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 8]: I 'll bide wi ' you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 8]: `` Ye 'll do nae sic thing .
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 20]: What 's to come o ' the buiks forbye , wantin ' you or me to luik efter them ?
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 23]: An ' the senawtus 'll be sayin ' that I got my heid clured wi ' fa'in ' agen the curbstane . ''
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 18]: `` I 'll tell them a ' aboot it , ane efter anither o ' them . ''
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 7]: `` Ay ; jist do sae .
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 7]: Tell them a ' aboot it .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 20]: It wad brak my hert to pairt wi ' the buiks afore I got them pitten in dacent order .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 2]: Faith !
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 9]: I wadna lie still i ' my coffin .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 35]: I wad be thrawin ' and turnin ' , and curfufflin ' a ' my win ` in ' sheet , sae that I wadna be respectable whan I bude to get up again .
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 24]: Sae ye maunna lat them think that I 'm ower drucken for the buiks to keep company wi ' , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 53]: Alec promised to do all he could to keep such a false conclusion from entering the minds of the senatus , and , satisfied that he would best serve the interests of Mr Cupples by doing so at once , set off for college , to call on the professors before lectures .
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 22]: The moment he was out of the room , Mr Cupples got out of bed , and crawled to the cupboard .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 57]: To his mortification , however , he found that what his landlady had said was in the main true ; for the rascals had not left a spoonful either in the bottle which he used as a decanter , or in the store-bottle called the _ tappit -LRB- crested -RRB- hen _ by way of pre-eminence .
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 33]: He drained the few drops which had gathered from the sides of the latter , for it was not in two halves as she had represented , and crawled back to bed .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 12]: A fresh access of fever was the consequence of the exertion .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 11]: It was many days before he was able to rise .
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 37]: After the morning-classes were over , Alec went to tell Mr Fraser , the only professor whom he had not already seen , about his adventure , and the consequences of the librarian 's generous interference .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 46]: `` I was uneasy about you , Mr Forbes , '' said the professor , `` for I heard from your friend Beauchamp that you had got into a row with the blackguards , but he did not know how you had come off . ''
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 4]: His friend Beauchamp !
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 7]: How did he know about it ?
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 9]: And when could he have told Mr Fraser ?
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 10]: -- But Kate entered , and Alec forgot Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 11]: She hesitated , but advanced and held out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 35]: Alec took it , but felt it tremble in his with a backward motion as of reluctance , and he knew that another thickness of the parting veil had fallen between her and him .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 11]: `` Will you stay and take tea with us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 4]: asked the professor .
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 10]: `` You never come to see us now . ''
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 7]: Alec stammered out an unintelligible excuse .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 13]: `` Your friend Beauchamp will be here , '' continued Mr Fraser .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 15]: `` I fear Mr Beauchamp is no friend of mine , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 7]: `` Why do you think that ?
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 10]: He speaks very kindly of you -- always . ''
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 5]: Alec made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 10]: Ugly things were vaguely showing themselves through a fog .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 5]: Kate left the room .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 13]: `` You had better stay , '' said the old man kindly .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 33]: `` I was up all night with Mr Cupples , '' answered Alec , longing to be alone that he might think things out , `` and I am anxious about him .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 17]: I should be quite uneasy if I did stay -- thank you , Mr Fraser . ''
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 15]: well ; your excuse is a good one , '' answered the old man .
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 4]: And they parted .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 28]: Alec went home with such a raging jealousy in his heart , that he almost forgot Mr Cupples , and scarcely cared how he might find him .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 18]: For this was the first time he had heard of any acquaintance between the professor and Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 11]: And why should Kate hesitate to shake hands with him ?
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 45]: He recalled how her hand had trembled and fluttered on his arm when he spoke of the red stain on the water ; and how she had declined to shake hands with him when he told her that he had come from the dissecting-room .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 38]: And the conviction seized him that Beauchamp had been working on her morbid sensitiveness to his disadvantage -- taking his revenge on him , by making the girl whom he worshipped shrink from him with irrepressible loathing .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 19]: And in the lulls of his rage and jealousy , he had some glimpses into Kate 's character .
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 24]: Not that he was capable of thinking about it ; but flashes of reality came once and again across the vapours of passion .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 40]: He saw too that her nerves came , as it were , nearer the surface than those of other people , and that thence she was exposed to those sudden changes of feeling which had so often bewildered him .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 18]: And now that delicate creature was in the hands of Beauchamp -- a selfish and vulgar-minded fellow !
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 25]: That he whom he had heard insult a dead woman , and whom he had chastised for it , should dare to touch Kate !
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 6]: His very touch was defilement .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 6]: But what could he do ?
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 5]: he could only hate .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 10]: And what was that , if Kate should love !
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 8]: But she could not love him already .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 12]: He would tell her what kind of a person he was .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 15]: But she would not believe him , and would set it down to jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 9]: And it would be mean to tell her .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 16]: Was Kate then to be left to such a fate without a word of warning ?
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 13]: He _ would _ tell her , and let her despise him .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 11]: -- And so the storm raged all the way home .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 21]: His only comfort lay in saying over and over again that Kate could not be in love with him yet .
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 66]: But if he had seen Kate , that same evening , looking up into Beauchamp 's face with a beauty in her own such as he had never beheld there , a beauty more than her face could hold , and overflowing in light from her eyes , he would have found this poor reed of comfort break in his hand and pierce his heart .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 52]: Nor could all his hatred have blinded him to the fact that Beauchamp looked splendid -- his pale face , with its fine , regular , clear-cut features , reflecting the glow of hers , and his Highland dress setting off to full advantage his breadth of shoulders and commanding height .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 19]: Kate had at last found one to whom she could look up , in whom she could trust !
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 14]: He had taken her by storm , and yet not without well-laid schemes .
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 59]: For instance , having discovered her admiration of Byron , instead of setting himself , like Alec , to make himself acquainted with that poet , by which he could have gained no advantage over her , he made himself her pupil , and listened to everything she had to say about Byron as to a new revelation .
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 38]: But , at the same time , he began to study Shelley ; and , in a few days , was able to introduce , with sufficient application , one or two passages gathered from his pages .
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 30]: Now , to a mind like that of Kate , with a strong leaning to the fantastic and strange , there was that in Shelley which quite overcrowed Byron .
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 40]: She listened with breathless wonder and the feeling that now at last she had found a poet just to her mind , who could raise visions of a wilder beauty than had ever crossed the horizon of her imagination .
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 25]: And the fountain whence she drank the charmed water of this delight was the lips of that grand youth , all nobleness and devotion .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 23]: And how wide his reading must be , seeing he knew a writer so well , of whom she had scarcely heard !
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 28]: Shelley enabled Beauchamp to make the same discovery , with regard to Kate 's peculiar constitution , on the verge of which Alec had lingered so long .
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 59]: For upon one occasion , when he quoted a few lines from the Sensitive Plant -- if ever there was a Sensitive Plant in the human garden , it was Kate -- she turned `` white with the whiteness of what is dead , '' shuddered , and breathed as if in the sensible presence of something disgusting .
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 37]: And the cunning Celt perceived in this emotion not merely an indication of what he must avoid , but a means as well of injuring him whose rival he had become for the sake of injury .
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 39]: Both to uncle and niece he had always spoken of Alec in familiar and friendly manner ; and now , he would occasionally drop a word or two with reference to him and break off with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 12]: `` What _ do _ you mean , Mr Beauchamp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 8]: said Kate on one of these occasions .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 18]: `` I was only thinking how Forbes would enjoy some lines I found in Shelley yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 6]: `` What are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 11]: `` Ah , I must not repeat them to you .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 18]: You would turn pale again , and it would kill me to see your white face . ''
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 23]: Whereupon Kate pressed the question no further , and an additional feeling of discomfort associated itself with the name of Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 12]: I have said that Mrs Forbes brought Annie home with her .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 13]: For several months she lay in her own little room at Howglen .
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 35]: Mrs Forbes was dreadfully anxious about her , often fearing much that her son 's heroism had only prolonged the process -- that she was dying notwithstanding from the effects of that awful night .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 31]: At length on a morning in February , the first wave of the feebly returning flow of the life-tide visited her heart , and she opened her eyes , seekingly .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 62]: Through her little window , at which in summer she knew that the honeysuckle leaned in as if peeping and hearkening , she saw the country wrapt in a winding-sheet of snow , through which patches of bright green had begun to dawn , just as her life had begun to show its returning bloom above the wan waves of death .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 11]: -- Sickness is just a fight between life and death .
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 20]: -- A thrill of gladness , too pleasant to be borne without tears , made her close her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 17]: They throbbed and ached beneath their lids , and the hot tears ran down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 40]: It was not gladness for this reason or for that , but the essential gladness of being that made her weep : there lay the world , white and green ; and here lay she , faint and alive .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 65]: And nothing was wanting to the gladness and kindness of Mrs Forbes but the indescribable aroma of motherhood , which she was not divine-woman enough to generate , save towards the offspring of her own body ; and that Annie did not miss much , because all knowledge she had of such `` heavenly health '' was associated with the memory of her father .
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 20]: As the spring advanced , her strength increased , till she became able to move about the house again .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 27]: Nothing was said of her return to the Bruces , who were not more desirous of having her than Mrs Forbes was of parting with her .
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 23]: But if there had ever been any danger of Alec 's falling in love with Annie , there was much more now .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 17]: For as her health returned , it became evident that a change had passed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 15]: She had always been a womanly child ; now she was a childlike woman .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 31]: Her eyes had grown deeper , and the outlines of her form more graceful ; and a flush as of sunrise dawned oftener over the white roses of her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 10]: She had ripened under the snow of her sickness .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 33]: She had not grown much , and was rather under than over the ordinary height ; but her shape produced the impression of tallness , and suggested no probability of further growth .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 23]: When first Thomas Crann saw her after her illness , he held her at arm 's length , and gazed at her .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 6]: `` Eh , lassie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 10]: he said , `` ye 're grown a wumman !
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 13]: Ye 'll hae the bigger hert to love the Lord wi ' .
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 33]: I thocht he wad hae ta'en ye awa ' a bairn , afore ever we had seen what ye wad turn oot ; and sair wad I hae missed ye , bairn !
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 12]: And a ' the sairer that I hae lost auld Tibbie .
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 16]: A man canna do weel withoot some woman or ither to tell him the trowth .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 16]: I wiss sair that I hadna been sae cankert wi ' her , whiles . ''
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 15]: `` I never heard her say that ye was ever cankert , Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 7]: `` No , I daursay no .
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 6]: She wadna say ` t .
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 6]: She wadna say ` t .
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 11]: She was a kin ' - herted auld body . ''
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 47]: `` But she didna like to be ca 'd auld , '' interposed Annie , with a smile half in sad reminiscence of her friend 's peculiarities , half in gentle humour , seeking to turn the conversation , and so divert Thomas from further self-accusation .
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 11]: `` Aweel , she 's nae that auld noo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 7]: he answered with a responsive smile .
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 5]: `` Eh , lassie !
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 27]: it maun be a fine thing to hae the wisdom o ' age alang wi ' the licht hert and the strang banes o ' yowth .
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 8]: I 'm growin ' some auld mysel .
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 46]: I was ance prood o ' that airm '' -- and it was a brawny right arm he stretched out - `` and there was no man within ten mile o ' Glamerton ` at cud lift what I cud lift whan I was five-and-twenty .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 11]: I daursay that luiks gey auld to you , no ?
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 66]: -- But ony lad i ' the mason-trade micht ding me at liftin ' noo ; for I 'm stiff i ' the back , and my airm 's jist reid-het whiles wi ' the rheumateeze ; and gin I lift onything by ordinar ' , it gars me host like a cat wi ' the backbane o ' a herrin ' in her thrapple .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 18]: -- Ye 'll be gaun back to Robert Bruce or lang , I 'm thinkin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 5]: `` I dinna ken .
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 9]: The mistress has said naething aboot it yet .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 15]: And I 'm in nae hurry , I can tell ye , Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 7]: `` Weel , I daursay no .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 30]: Ye maun tak a heap o ' care , lass , that the plenty and content ye 're livin ' in doesna spring up and choke the word . ''
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 37]: `` Ay , Thomas , '' answered Annie with a smile ; `` it 's a fine thing to hae reamy milk to yer parritch , in place o ' sky-blue to meal and water . ''
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 6]: What could ail the lassie ?
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 9]: She had never spoken lightly about anything before .
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 18]: Was she too , like his old friend Alec , forgetting the splendour of her high calling ?
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 48]: Such was the thought that passed through Thomas 's mind ; but the truth was that , under the genial influences of home tenderness and early womanhood , a little spring of gentle humour had begun to flow softly through the quiet fields of her childlike nature .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 11]: The mason gazed at her doubtfully , and was troubled .
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 35]: Annie saw his discomposure , and taking his great hand in her two little ones , looked full into his cold grey eyes , and said , still smiling , `` Eh , Thomas !
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 21]: wadna ye hae a body mak ' a grainy fun whiles whan it comes o ' itsel ' like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 20]: But Thomas , anxious about the state of mind that produced the change , did not show himself satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 20]: `` We dinna hear ` at the Saviour himsel ' ever sae muckle as smiled , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 19]: `` Weel , that wad hae been little wonner , wi ' what he had upo ' 'm .
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 14]: But I 'm nae sure that he didna , for a ' that .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 9]: Fowk disna aye tell whan a body lauchs .
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 111]: I 'm thinkin ' gin ane o ' the bairnies that he took upo ' 's knee , -- an ' he was ill-pleased wi ' them ` at wad hae sheued them awa ' , -- gin ane o ' them had hauden up his wee timmer horsie , wi ' a broken leg , and had prayed him to work a miracle an ' men ' the leg , he wadna hae wrocht a miracle maybe , I daursay , but he wad hae smilet , or maybe lauchen a wee , and he wad hae me n't the leg some gait or ither to please the bairnie .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 53]: And gin ' t had been me , I wad raither hae had the men ` in ' o ' 's ain twa han 's , wi ' a knife to help them maybe , nor twenty miracles upo ' ` t. '' Thomas gazed at her for a moment in silence .
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 31]: Then with a slow shake of the head , and a full-blown smile on his rugged face , he said : `` Ye 're a curious cratur ' , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 13]: I dinna richtly ken what to mak ' o ' ye whiles .
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 16]: Ye 're like a suckin ' bairn and a gran ` mither baith in ane .
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 18]: But I 'm thinkin ' , atween the twa , ye 're maistly i ' the right .
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 9]: And ye hae set me richt afore noo .
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 13]: -- Sae ye 're nae gaun hame to the Bruces again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 25]: `` I didna say that , '' answered Annie ; `` I only said I had h ` ard naething aboot it yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 12]: `` What for dinna ye jine the kirk , noo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 18]: said Thomas abruptly , after having tried in vain to find a gradual introduction to the question .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 25]: `` Dinna ye think it 's a deowty to keep in min ' what the great Shepherd did for his ain chosen flock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 9]: `` Nae doot o ' that , Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 10]: But I never thocht o ' sic a thing .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 16]: I dinna even ken ` at I am ane o ' the elec ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 7]: `` Ye dinna ken yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 9]: `` No , '' answered Annie , sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 10]: `` I wonner at that , '' returned Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 21]: `` And , forby , '' resumed Annie , `` gin I war , I 'm no guid eneuch yet .
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 14]: An ' besides that -- '' But here she stopped and remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 9]: `` What was ye gaun to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 5]: asked Thomas , encouragingly .
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 6]: But Annie did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 4]: She looked perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 19]: With the intuition of sympathy springing from like thoughts , Thomas guessed what was moving in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 15]: `` I ken what ye 're thinkin ' , lassie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 43]: `` Ye canna help thinkin ' that there 's some in oor mids wha may as weel be nameless , for that they are no credit to us , neyther wad be to ony body o ' whuch they war jined members .
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 9]: Isna that yer trouble , bairn ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 11]: ` Deed is ` t , in pairt , Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 34]: But it 's mair the state o ' my ain feelin 's wi ' regaird to ane in particular , nor the fac ' that he 's a member o ' the kirk .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 39]: Gin I cud be sure that Mr Bruce wad aye be at the ither en ' o ' the seat , I micht think o ' ` t. It 's no that I wadna lat him tak it .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 7]: I daurna meddle wi ' that .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 30]: But gin I had to tak ' it frae his han ' , I jist cudna regaird it as the sacred thing that it bude to be considered . ''
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 9]: Thomas remained silent , with downcast thoughtful look .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 54]: It may be necessary to state , in explanation of Annie 's feelings , that the Scotch , at the celebration of the Eucharist , sit in long rows , and pass the bread , each breaking off a portion for himself , and the wine , from the one to the other .
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 23]: The compressed lips and motionless countenance of Thomas showed that he was thinking more than he was prepared to clothe in words .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 35]: After standing thus for a few moments , he lifted his head , and returning no answer to Annie 's exposition of her feelings , bade her _ good-bye _ , and walked away .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 15]: The drift of Thomas 's reflections I shall now help my reader to see .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 22]: Their appetite for prophecy having assuaged with the assuaging flood , the people of Glamerton had no capacity for excitement left .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 18]: The consequence was that the congregations , especially the evening congregations , began at once to diminish .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 55]: Having once ceased to feel anxiety about some vague impending vengeance , comparatively few chose to be rated any longer about their sins ; while some seeing how in the _ spate _ the righteous were taken and the wicked left , felt themselves aggrieved , and staid at home on the Sunday nights .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 9]: Nor was the deterioration confined to the congregations .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 53]: Not only had the novelty of Mr Turnbull 's style worn off , but he felt himself that he could not preach with the same fervour as before ; the fact being that he had exhausted the electric region of the spiritual brain , and without repose it could never fulminate again .
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 35]: A second and worse consequence was that , in his dissatisfaction with himself , he attempted to _ get up _ his former excitement by preaching as if he were still under its influences .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 24]: Upon this his conscience sternly accused him of hypocrisy and pretence , which reacted in paralysis ; and the whole business became wretched .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 38]: Even his greatest admirers were compelled to acknowledge that Mr Turnbull had lost much of his unction , and that except the Spirit were poured down upon them from on high , their prospects were very disheartening .
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 142]: For even the best men in _ the Church _ , as , following apostolic example without regard to circumstance , they called each separate community of the initiate , were worldly enough to judge of the degree of heavenly favour shown them , not by the love they bore to the truth and to each other , not by the purity of their collective acts and the prevalence of a high standard of morality in the individual -- poor as even these divine favours would have been as a measure of the divine favour -- but , in a great degree , by the success which attended the preaching of their pastor , in adding to their esoteric communion , and , still worse , by the numbers which repaired to their court of the Gentiles -- their exoteric congregation .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 30]: Nor , it must be confessed , was even Thomas Crann , in many things so wise and good , and in all things so aspiring , an exception .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 24]: Pondering over the signs of disfavour and decay , he arrived at the conclusion that there must be an Achan in the camp .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 29]: And indeed if there were an Achan , he had known well enough , for a long time , who would turn out to represent that typical person .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 17]: Of course , it could be no other than the money-loving , the mammon-worshipping Robert Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 45]: When , therefore , he found that such a pearl of price as Annie Anderson was excluded from their `` little heaven below , '' by the presence of this possible anti-typical Achan , he could not help feeling his original conviction abundantly strengthened .
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 10]: But he did not see what could be done .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 13]: Meantime , on the loving , long-remembering Annie dawned a great pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 26]: James Dow came to see her , and had a long interview with Mrs Forbes , the result of which she learned after his departure .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 37]: One of the farm-servants who had been at Howglen for some years was going to leave at the next term , and Mrs Forbes had asked Dow whether he knew of one to take his place .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 44]: Whereupon he had offered himself , and they had arranged everything for his taking the position of grieve or foreman , which post he had occupied with James Anderson , and was at present occupying some ten or twelve miles up the hill-country .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 82]: Few things could have pleased Mrs Forbes more ; for James Dow was recognized throughout the country as the very pattern of what a foreman ought to be ; his character for saving his employers all possible expense , having more than its just proportion in generating this reputation ; for this is a capacity which , in a poor country where it is next to impossible to be enterprising , will naturally receive at least its full share of commendation .
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 55]: Of late , Mrs Forbes had found it more difficult to meet her current expenses ; for Alec 's requirements at college were heavier this year than they had been before ; so that , much to her annoyance , she had been compelled to delay the last half-yearly payment of Bruce 's interest .
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 32]: Nor could she easily bear to recall the expression upon his keen ferret-like face when she informed him that it would be more convenient to pay the money a month hence .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 17]: That month had passed , and another , before she had been able to do so .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 26]: For although the home-expenses upon a farm in Scotland are very small , yet in the midst of plenty , money is often scarce enough .
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 37]: Now , however , she hoped that , with James Dow 's management , things would go better , and she would be able to hold her mental head a little higher in her own presence .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 31]: So she was happy , knowing nothing of the cloud that was gathering over the far-off university , soon to sweep northward , and envelope Howglen in its dusky folds .
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXIX .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 35]: A state of something like emotional stupefaction succeeded to the mental tumult of that evening when first Alec saw that his worst and wildest forebodings might be even already on the point of realization .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 20]: The poor glimmer of hope that remained was only enough to show how terrible was the darkness around it .
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 31]: It was well for him that gratitude required of him some ministrations beyond those which he took out of his landlady 's hands the moment he came in from college .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 28]: His custom was to carry his books to the sick man 's room , and wearily pretend , without even seeming , to be occupied with them .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 33]: While thus unemployed he did not know how anxiously he was watched by the big blue eyes of his friend , shining like two fallen stars from the cavern of his bed .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 26]: But , as I have said , he had more to do for him than merely to supply his few wants when he came home .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 47]: For the patient 's uneasiness about the books and the catalogue led him to offer not only to minister to the wants of the students in the middle of the day , but to spend an hour or two every evening in carrying on the catalogue .
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 17]: This engagement was a great relief to the pro-librarian , and he improved more rapidly thenceforth .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 38]: Whether Alec 's labour was lightened or not by the fact that he had a chance of seeing Kate pass the windows , I can not tell , but I think any kind of emotion lightens labour .
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 52]: And I think the labour lightened his pain ; and I know he was not so absorbed in his unhappiness , though at times the flashes of a keen agony broke from the dull cloud of his misery , as to perform the duties he had undertaken in a perfunctory manner .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 8]: The catalogue made slow but steady progress .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 6]: And so did the librarian .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 28]: `` Mr Forbes , '' said Mr Fraser , looking at him kindly , one morning after the lecture , `` you are a great stranger now .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 11]: Wo n't you come and spend to-morrow evening with us ?
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 9]: We are going to have a little party .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 24]: It is my birthday , though I 'm sure I do n't know why an old man like me should have any birthdays .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 7]: But it 's not my doing .
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 12]: Kate found it out , and she would have a merry-making .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 30]: I think myself after a man 's forty , he should go back to thirty-nine , thirty-eight , and so on , indicating his progress towards none at all .
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 16]: That gives him a good sweep before he comes to two , one , nought .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 10]: At which rate I shall be thirteen to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 23]: The old man had rattled on as if he saw the cloud on Alec 's face and would dispel it by kindness .
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 8]: I believe he was uneasy about him .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 25]: Whether he divined the real cause of his gloom , or feared that he was getting into bad ways , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 38]: He did not succeed , however , in dispelling the cloud ; for the thought at this moment passing through Alec 's mind was , that Kate had wanted the merry-making in order to have Beauchamp there .
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 32]: But with a feeling like that which makes one irritate a smarting wound , or urge on an aching tooth , he resolved to go and have his pain in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 7]: He was the first to arrive .
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 17]: Kate was in the drawing-room at the piano , radiant in white -- lovelier than ever .
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 20]: She rose and met him with some embarrassment , which she tried to cover under more than usual kindness .
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 22]: She had not wished Alec to be one of the company , knowing it would make him unhappy and her uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 5]: `` Oh Kate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 8]: said Alec , overpowered with her loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 19]: Kate took it for a reproach , and making no reply , withdrew her hand and turned away .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 16]: Alec saw as she turned that all the light had gone out of her face .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 38]: But that instant Beauchamp entered , and as she turned once more to greet him , the light flashed from her face and her eyes , as if her heart had been a fountain of rosy flame .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 26]: Beauchamp was magnificent , the rather quiet tartan of his clan being lighted up with all the silver and jewels of which the dress admits .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 48]: In the hilt of his dirk , in his brooch , and for buttons , he wore a set of old family topazes , instead of the commoner cairngorm , so that as he entered he flashed golden light from the dark green cloud of his tartan .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 32]: Not observing Alec , he advanced to Kate with the confidence of an accepted lover ; but some motion of her hand or glance from her eyes warned him in time .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 23]: He looked round , started a little , and greeted him with a slight bow , of which Alec took no notice .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 31]: He then turned to Kate and began to talk in a low tone , to which she listened with her head hanging like the topmost bell of a wild hyacinth .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 17]: As he looked , the last sickly glimmer of Alec 's hope died out in darkness .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 15]: But he bore up in bitterness , and a demon awoke in him laughing .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 33]: He saw the smooth handsome face , the veil of so much that was mean and wretched , bending over the loveliness he loved , yet the demon in him only laughed .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 27]: It may appear strange that they should behave so like lovers in the presence of any third person , much more in the presence of Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 55]: But Beauchamp had now made progress enough to secure his revenge of mortification ; and for that , with the power which he had acquired over Kate 's sensitive nature , he drew her into the sphere of his flaunted triumph , and made her wound Alec to the root of his vulnerable being .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 25]: Had Alec then seen his own face , he would have seen upon it the sneer that he hated so upon that of Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 16]: For all wickedness tends to destroy individuality , and declining natures assimilate as they sink .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 34]: Other visitors arrived , and Alec found a strange delight in behaving as if he knew of no hidden wound , and his mind were in a state of absolute _ neglig _ .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 14]: But how would he meet the cold wind blowing over the desolate links ?
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 23]: Some music , and a good deal of provincial talk -- not always less human and elevating than the metropolitan -- followed .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 32]: Beauchamp moderated his attentions to Kate ; but Alec saw that it was in compliance with his desire that , though reluctant , she went a second time to the piano .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 67]: The song she had just sung was insignificant enough ; but the second was one of the ballads of her old Thulian nurse , and had the merit of an antique northern foundation at least , although it had evidently passed through the hands of a lowland poet before it had , in its present form , found its way northwards again to the Shetland Isles .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 25]: The first tone of the ghostly music startled Alec , and would have arrested him even if the voice had not been Kate 's .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 8]: `` Sweep up the flure , Janet .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 5]: Put on anither peat .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 16]: It 's a lown and starry nicht , Janet , And neither cauld nor weet .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 16]: And it 's open hoose we keep the nicht For ony that may be oot .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 33]: It 's the nicht atween the Sancts and Souls , Whan the bodiless gang aboot Set the chairs back to the wa ' , Janet ; Mak ' ready for quaiet fowk .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 19]: Hae a ' thing as clean as a win ` in ' sheet : They comena ilka ook .
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 26]: There 's a spale * upo ' the flure , Janet ; And there 's a rowan-berry : Sweep them into the fire , Janet .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 8]: -- They 'll be welcomer than merry .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 34]: Syne set open the door , Janet -- Wide open for wha kens wha ; As ye come benn to yer bed , Janet , Set it open to the wa ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 37]: She set the chairs back to the wa ' , But ane made o ' the birk ; She sweepit the flure , -- left that ae spale , A lang spale o ' the aik .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 37]: The nicht was lowne , and the stars sat still , Aglintin ' doon the sky ; And the souls crap oot o ' their mooly graves , A ' dank wi ' lyin ' by .
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 33]: She had set the door wide to the wa ' , And blawn the peats rosy reid ; They war shoonless feet gaed oot and in , Nor clampit as they gaed .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 16]: Whan midnicht cam ' , the mither rase -- She wad gae see and hear .
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 19]: Back she cam ' wi ' a glowerin ' face , And sloomin ' wi ' verra fear .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 4]: * A wood-shaving .
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 13]: `` There 's ane o ' them sittin ' afore the fire !
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 25]: Janet , gang na to see : Ye left a chair afore the fire , Whaur I tauld ye nae chair sud be . ''
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 29]: Janet she smiled in her mother 's face : She had brunt the roddin reid ; And she left aneath the birken chair The spale frae a coffin-lid .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 16]: She rase and she gaed butt the hoose , Aye steekin ' door and door .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 15]: Three hours gaed by or her mother heard Her fit upo ' the floor .
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 36]: But whan the grey cock crew , she heard The sound o ' shoeless feet ; Whan the red cock crew , she heard the door , And a sough o ' wind and weet .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 36]: And Janet cam ' back wi ' a wan face , But never a word said she ; No man ever heard her voice lood oot , It cam ' like frae ower the sea .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 32]: And no man ever heard her lauch , Nor yet say alas or wae ; But a smile aye glimmert on her wan face , Like the moonlicht on the sea .
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 38]: And ilka nicht ` tween the Sancts and the Souls , Wide open she set the door ; And she mendit the fire , and she left ae chair , And that spale upo ' the floor .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 16]: And at midnicht she gaed butt the hoose , Aye steekin ' door and door .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 35]: Whan the reid cock crew , she cam ' benn the hoose , Aye wanner than afore -- Wanner her face , and sweeter her smile ; Till the seventh All Souls ' eve .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 19]: Her mother she heard the shoeless feet , Said `` she 's comin ' , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 17]: But she camna benn , and her mother lay ; For fear she cudna stan ' .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 16]: But up she rase and benn she gaed , Whan the gowden cock had crawn .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 33]: And Janet sat upo ' the chair , White as the day did daw ; Her smile was a sunlight left on the sea , Whan the sun has gane awa ' .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 10]: Alec had never till now heard her sing really .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 11]: Wild music and eerie ballad together filled and absorbed him .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 30]: He was still gazing at her lovely head , when the last wailing sounds of the accompaniment ceased , and her face turned round , white as Janet 's .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 33]: She gave one glance of unutterable feeling up into Beauchamp 's face , and hiding her own in her handkerchief , sobbed out , `` You would make me sing it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 5]: and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 8]: Alec 's heart swelled with indignant sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 6]: But what could he do ?
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 20]: The room became insupportable the moment she had quitted it , and he made his way to the door .
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 13]: As he opened it , he could not help glancing at Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 24]: Instead of the dismay he expected , he saw triumph on his pale countenance , and in the curl of his scarred lip .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 8]: -- He flew frantic from the house .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 11]: The sky was crowded with the watchings of starry eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 15]: To his fancy , they were like Beauchamp 's , and he hated them .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 31]: Seeking refuge from their gaze , he rushed to the library , and threw himself on a heap of foreign books , which he had that morning arranged for binding .
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 44]: A ghostly glimmer from the snow , and the stars overhead , made the darkness thinner about the windows ; but there was no other light in the place ; and there he lay , feeling darker within than the night around him .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 28]: Kate was weeping in her room ; that contemptible ape had wounded her ; and instead of being sorry for it , was rejoicing in his power .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 16]: And he could not go to her ; she would receive no comfort from him .
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 6]: It was a bitter hour .
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 13]: Eternity must be very rich to make up for some such hours .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 21]: He had lain a long time with his face down upon the books , when he suddenly started and listened .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 18]: He heard the sound of an opening door , but not of the door in ordinary use .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 12]: Thinking it proceeded from some thievish intent , he kept still .
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 21]: There was another door , in a corner , covered with books , but it was never opened at all .
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 26]: It communicated with a part of the buildings of the quadrangle which had been used for the abode of the students under a former economy .
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 21]: It had been abandoned now for many years , as none slept any longer within the walls of the college .
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 44]: Alec knew all this , but he did not know that there was also a communication between this empty region and Mr Fraser 's house ; or that the library had been used before as a _ tryst _ by Beauchamp and Kate .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 15]: The door closed , and the light of a lantern flashed to the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 43]: Wondering that such a place should excite the cupidity of housebreakers , yet convinced that such the intruders were , Alec moved gently into the embrasure of one of the windows , against the corner of which abutted a screen of book-shelves .
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 21]: A certain light rustling , however , startled him into doubt , and the doubt soon passed into painful conviction .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 10]: `` Why were you so unkind , Patrick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 6]: said the voice of Kate .
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 11]: `` You know it kills me to sing that ballad .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 7]: I can not bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 15]: `` Why should you mind singing an old song your nurse taught you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 9]: `` My nurse learned it from my mother .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 3]: Oh Patrick !
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 17]: what _ would _ my mother say if she knew that I met you this way ?
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 6]: You should n't ask me .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 15]: You know I can refuse you nothing ; and you should be generous . ''
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 12]: Alec could not hear his answer , and he knew why .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 6]: That scar on his lip !
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 5]: Kate 's lips there !
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 9]: Of course Alec ought not to have listened .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 26]: But the fact was , that , for the time , all consciousness of free will and capability of action had vanished from his mind .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 17]: His soul was but a black gulf into which poured the Phlegethontic cataract of their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 7]: `` Ah , yes , Patrick !
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 4]: Kisses are easy .
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 7]: But you hurt me terribly sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 5]: And I know why .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 8]: You hate my cousin , poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 10]: -- and you want me to hate him too .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 12]: I wonder if you love me as much as he does !
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 18]: -- or did ; for surely I have been unkind enough to cure him of loving me .
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 9]: Surely you are not jealous of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 7]: `` Jealous of _ him _ !
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 7]: -- I should think not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 12]: Human expression could have thrown no more scorn into the word .
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 7]: `` But you hate him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 7]: `` I do n't hate him .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 10]: He 's not worth hating -- the awkward steer !
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 19]: -- although I confess I have cause to dislike him , and have some gratification in mortifying him .
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 11]: But he 's not a pleasant subject to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 10]: `` His mother has been very kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 15]: I wish you would make it up with him for my sake , Patrick .
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 21]: He may be uncouth and awkward -- I do n't know -- but that 's no reason for hating him .
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 13]: I love you so that I could love anybody that loved you .
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 17]: You do n't know how I love you , Patrick -- though you are unkind sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 31]: The world used to look so cold , and narrow , and grey ; but now there is a flush like sunset over everything , and I am so happy !
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 17]: Patrick , do n't make me do things before my cousin that will hurt him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 15]: Alec knew that she pressed closer to Beauchamp , and offered him her face .
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 10]: `` Listen , my Kate , '' said Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 20]: `` I know there are things you can not bear to hear ; but you must hear this . ''
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 9]: `` No , no , not now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 5]: answered Kate , shuddering .
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 33]: Alec knew how she looked -- saw her with the eyes of his memory as she had looked once or twice -- and listened unconscious of any existence but that of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 14]: `` You must , Kate , and you shall , '' said Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 16]: `` You asked me only yesterday how I came by that scar on my lip .
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 5]: I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 21]: I rebuked that cousin of yours for unmanly behaviour in the dissecting-room , the very first time he entered it .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 16]: He made no reply ; but when we came out , he struck me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 36]: The icy mood passed away , and such a glow of red anger rushed through Alec 's veins , that he felt as if the hot blast from molten metal were playing upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 8]: That Kate should marry such a man !
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 23]: The same moment he stood in the light of the lantern , with one word on his lips : `` Liar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 11]: Beauchamp 's hand sprang to the hilt of his dirk .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 6]: Alec laughed with bitter contempt .
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 14]: he said ; `` even you will not say I am a coward .
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 6]: Do if you dare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 13]: After her first startled cry , Kate had stood staring and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 7]: Beauchamp 's presence of mind returned .
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 25]: He thrust his half-drawn dirk into its sheath , and with a curl of the scarred lip , said coldly -- `` Eaves-dropping . ''
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 7]: `` Lying , '' retorted Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 35]: `` Well , I must say , '' returned Beauchamp , assuming his most polished tone , `` that this kind of conversation is at least unusual in the presence of a lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 11]: Without making him any reply , Alec turned to Kate .
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 32]: `` Kate , '' he said , `` I swear to you that I struck him only after fair warning , after insult to myself , and insult to the dead .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 17]: He did not know that I was able to give him the chastisement he deserved . ''
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 10]: I doubt if Kate heard any of this speech .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 19]: She had been leaning against a book-case , and from it she now slipped sideways to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 5]: `` You brute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 3]: said Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 10]: `` You will answer to me for this . ''
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 9]: `` When you please , '' returned Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 15]: `` Meantime you will leave this room , or I will make you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 7]: `` Go to the devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 11]: said Beauchamp , again laying his hand on his dirk .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 25]: `` You can claim fair play no more than a wolf , '' said Alec , keeping his eye on his enemy 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 6]: `` You had better go .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 15]: I have only to ring this bell and the sacrist will be here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 9]: `` That is your regard for your cousin !
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 9]: You would expose her to the servants ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 12]: `` I will expose her to anything rather than to you .
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 9]: I have held my tongue too long . ''
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 10]: `` And you will leave her lying here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 9]: `` You will leave her lying here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 10]: `` That is your revenge , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 11]: `` I want no revenge even on you , Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 3]: Go . ''
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 23]: `` I will neither forestall nor forget mine , '' said Beauchamp , as he turned and went out into the quadrangle .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 18]: When Alec came to think about it , he could not understand the ease of his victory .
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 45]: He did not know what a power their first encounter had given him over the inferior nature of Beauchamp , in whom the animal , unsupported by the moral , was cowed before the animal in Forbes , backed by the sense of right .
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 29]: And above all things Beauchamp hated to find himself in an awkward position , which certainly would have been his case if Alec had rung for the sacrist .
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 14]: Nor was he capable of acting well on the spur of any moment .
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 12]: He must have plans : those he would carry out remorselessly .
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 10]: -- So he went away to excogitate further revenge .
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 23]: But he was in love with Kate just enough to be uneasy as to the result of Alec 's interview with her .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 9]: Returning to Kate , Alec found her moaning .
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 22]: He supported her head as she had done for him in that old harvest field , and chafed her chilly hands .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 25]: Before her senses had quite returned , she began to talk , and , after several inarticulate attempts , her murmured words became plain .
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 16]: `` Never mind , dear , '' she said ; `` the boy is wild .
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 8]: He does n't know what he says .
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 13]: Oh , Patrick , my heart is aching with love to you .
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 29]: It is good love , I know ; and you must be kind to me , and not make me do what I do n't like to do .
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 17]: And you must forgive my poor cousin , for he did not mean to tell lies .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 15]: He fancies you bad , because I love you so much more than him .
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 18]: But you know I ca n't help it , and I daresay he ca n't either . ''
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 12]: Alec felt as if a green flame were consuming his brain .
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 22]: And the blood surged so into his head and eyes , that he saw flashes of fire between him and Kate .
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 18]: He could not remain in such a false position , with Kate taking him for her lover .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 16]: But what an awful shock it would be to her when she discovered the truth !
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 7]: How was it to be avoided ?
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 10]: He must get her home before she recovered quite .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 16]: For this there was but one chance , and that lay in a bold venture .
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 13]: Mr Fraser 's door was just across a corner of the quadrangle .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 9]: He would carry her to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 26]: The guests must be gone , and it was a small household , so that the chance of effecting it undiscovered was a good one .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 39]: He did effect it ; in three minutes more he had laid her on her own bed , had rung her bell , and had sped out of the house as fast and as quietly as he could .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 31]: His gratification at having succeeded in escaping Kate 's recognition , bore him up for a little , but before he reached home his heart felt like a burnt-out volcano .
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 21]: Meantime Mr Cupples had been fretting over his absence , for he had come to depend very much upon Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 42]: At last he had rung the bell , knowing that Mrs Leslie was out , and that it would be answered by a dirty girl in nailed shoes turned down at the heel ; she would be open to a bribe .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 8]: Nor did she need much persuasion besides .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 20]: Off she ran with his empty bottle , to get it filled at the grocer 's over the way .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 33]: When Alec came home , he found his friend fast asleep in bed , the room smelling strongly of toddy , and the bottle standing on the table beside the empty tumbler .
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 26]: Faint in body , mind , and spirit , as if from the sudden temptation of an unholy power , he caught up the bottle .
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 21]: The _ elixir mortis _ flowed gurgling from the narrow neck into the tumbler which Mr Cupples had lately emptied .
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 42]: Heedless and reckless , he nearly filled it , and was just lifting it to his lips , when a cry half-moulded into a curse rang from the bed , and the same instant the tumbler was struck from his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 23]: It flew in fragments against the grate , and the spirit rushed in a roaring flame of demoniacal wrath up the chimney .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 5]: `` Damn you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 41]: half-shrieked , half-panted Mr Cupples in his night-shirt , at Alec 's elbow , still under the influence of the same spirit he had banned on its way to Alec Forbes 's empty house -- `` damn you , bantam !
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 8]: ye 've broken my father 's tumler .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 9]: De'il tak ' ye for a vaigabon ' !
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 15]: I 've a guid min ' to thraw the neck o ' ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 29]: Seeing Mr Cupples was only two-thirds of Alec 's height , and one-half of his thickness , the threat , as he then stood , was rather ludicrous .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 11]: Miserable as he was , Alec could not help laughing .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 7]: `` Ye may lauch , bantam !
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 15]: but I want no companion in hell to cast his damnation in my teeth .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 39]: Gin ye touch that bottle again , faith , I 'll brain ye , and sen ' ye into the ither warl ' withoot that handle at least for Sawtan to catch a grip o ' ye by .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 43]: And there _ may _ be a handle somewhaur o ' the richt side o ' ye for some saft-hertit angel to lay han ' upo ' and gie ye a lift whaur ye ill deserve to gang , ye thrawn buckie !
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 10]: Efter a ' that I hae said to ye !
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 5]: -- Damn ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 9]: Alec burst into a loud roar of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 27]: For there was the little man standing in his shirt , shaking a trembling fist at him , stammering with eagerness , and half-choked with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 20]: `` Gang to yer bed , Mr Cupples , or ye 'll tak ' yer deith o ' cauld .
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 4]: Luik here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 8]: And Alec seized the bottle once more .
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 33]: Mr Cupples flew at him , and would have knocked the bottle after the glass , had not Alec held it high above his reach , exclaiming , `` Toots , man !
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 12]: I 'm gaein ' to pit it intil its ain neuk .
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 12]: Gang ye to yer bed , and lippen to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 17]: `` Ye gie me yer word , ye winna pit it to yer mou ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 8]: `` I do , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 20]: The same moment Mr Cupples was floundering on the bed in a perplexed attempt to get under the bed-clothes .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 12]: A violent fit of coughing was the consequence of the exertion .
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 22]: `` Ye 're like to toom yer ain kist afore ye brain my pan , Mr Cupples , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 20]: `` Haud yer tongue , and lat me host -LRB- cough -RRB- in peace , '' panted Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 15]: When the fit was over , he lay still , and stared at Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 17]: Alec had sat down in Mr Cupples 's easy-chair , and was staring at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 9]: `` I see , '' muttered Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 7]: `` This 'll do no longer .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 17]: The laddie 's gaein ' to the dogs for want o ' bein ' luikit efter .
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 7]: I maun be up the morn .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 5]: It 's thae wimmen !
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 3]: thae wimmen !
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 3]: Puir things !
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 16]: they canna aye help it ; but , de'il tak ' them for bonnie oolets !
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 15]: mony 's the fine laddie they drive into the cluiks o ' auld Horney .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 22]: Michtna some gran ' discovery be made in Pheesiology , to enable the warl ' to gang on wantin ' them ?
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 6]: But , Lord preserve me !
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 11]: I wad hae naething left worth greetin ' aboot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 8]: He hid his face in the bed-clothes .
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 19]: Alec hearing part of this muttered discourse , had grown attentive , but there was nothing more forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 12]: He sat for a little , staring helplessly into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 8]: The world was very blank and dismal .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 17]: Then he rose to go to bed ; for Mr Cupples did not require him now .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 17]: Finding him fast asleep under the bed-clothes , he made him as comfortable as he could .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 17]: Then he locked the closet where the whisky was , and took the key with him .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 9]: Their mutual care in this respect was comical .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXX .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 14]: The next morning , Alec saw Mr Cupples in bed before he left .
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 30]: His surprise therefore was great when , entering the library after morning lectures , he found him seated in his usual place , hard at work on his catalogue .
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 29]: Except that he was yet thinner and paler than before , the only difference in his appearance was that his eyes were brighter and his complexion was clearer .
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 8]: `` You here , Mr Cupples ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 14]: `` What garred ye lock the press last nicht , ye deevil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 14]: returned the librarian , paying no attention to Alec 's expression of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 45]: `` But I say , bantam , '' he continued , not waiting for a reply , which indeed was unnecessary , `` ye hae dune yer wark weel -- verra near as weel 's I cud hae dune ' t mysel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 18]: `` I 'm sure , Mr Cupples , it was the least thing I could do . ''
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 5]: `` Ye impident cock !
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 20]: It was the verra best you cud do , or ye wadna hae come within sicht o ' me .

Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 3]: `` Faith !

Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 5]: `` Ay , ay .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 23]: It 's a forlorn hope , a ' ` at I 'm fit for , Alec Forbes , '' returned Cupples sadly .
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 18]: This struck Alec so near his own grief that he could not reply with even seeming cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 4]: He said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 4]: Mr Cupples resumed .
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 14]: `` I hae twa three words to say to you , Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 16]: Can ye believe in a man as weel 's ye can in a wumman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 10]: `` I can believe in you , Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 7]: That I 'll sweir till . ''
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 17]: `` Weel , jist sit doon there , and carry on frae whaur ye loot sit .

Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 26]: But we 'll come back here , and i ' the gloamin ' , I 'll gie ye a bit episode i ' my life .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 9]: -- Episode did I ca ' ` it ?
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 15]: Faith it 's my life itsel ' , and no worth muckle , eyther .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 15]: Ye 'll be the first man that ever I tell ' t it till .
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 16]: And ye may judge o ' my regaird for ye frae that fac ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 14]: Alec worked away at his catalogue , and then attended the afternoon lecture .
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 15]: The dinner at Luckie Cumstie 's followed -- of the plainest , but good .
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 18]: Alec 's trouble had not yet affected the region in which Paley seats the organ of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 12]: And while an appetite exists , a dinner will be interesting .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 16]: Just as the gloaming was fading into night , they went back to the library .
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 14]: `` Will I rin ower to the sacrist 's for a licht ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 3]: asked Alec .
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 8]: `` Na , na ; lat be .
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 9]: The mirk 's mercifu ' , whiles . ''
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 10]: `` I canna unnerstan ' ye , Mr Cupples .

Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 12]: `` I didna mean to anger ye , Mr Cupples . ''
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 10]: `` Whaur naething 's meant , naething 's dune .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 5]: I 'm nae angert .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 7]: And that ye 'll sune see .
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 19]: Sit ye doon there , and tak yer plaid aboot ye , or ye 'll be cauld . ''
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 7]: `` Ye hae nae plaid yersel .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 12]: Ye 're mair like to be cauld nor I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 10]: `` I weir my plaid o ' my inside .
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 6]: Ye haena had ony toddy .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 4]: Deil 's broo !
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 8]: It may weel haud a body warm .
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 8]: It comes frae a het quarter . ''
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 40]: The open oak ceiling overhead was getting very dark by this time ; and the room , divided and crowded with books in all directions , left little free course to the light that struggled through the dusty windows .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 25]: The friends seated themselves on the lower steps of an open circular oak staircase which wound up to a gallery running round the walls .
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 109]: `` Efter I had taen my degree , '' began Mr Cupples , `` frae the han ' o ' this same couthy auld mither , I heard o ' a grit leebrary i ' the north -- I winna say whaur -- that wantit the han ' o ' a man that kenned what he was aboot , to pit in dacent order , sae that a body cud lay his han 's upon a buik whan he wantit it , and no be i ' the condition o ' Tantalus , wi ' watter at the mou , but nane for the hause -LRB- throat -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 9]: Dinna imaigin ' it was a public library .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 4]: Na , na .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 40]: It belonged to a grit an ' gran ' hoose -- the Lord hae respec till ` t , for it 's no joke o ' a hoose that -- as I weel kent afore a ' was ower !

Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 34]: But I was speikin ' aboot buiks an ' no aboot women , only somehoo whatever a man begins wi ' , he 'll aye en ' aff wi ' the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 16]: The Lord hae a care o ' them , for they 're awfu ' craters !
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 10]: They 're no like ither fowk a ` thegither .
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 30]: Weel , ye see , I had a room till mysel ' , forby the library an ' my bedroom -- an ' a gran ' place that was !
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 35]: I didna see onything o ' the family , for I had my denner and my wine and ' a thing human stammack cud desire served up till me i ' my ain room .
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 39]: But ae day , my denner was made up o ' ae mess efter anither , vera fine nae doot , but unco queer and ootlandish , and I had nae appeteet , and I cudna eat it .
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 17]: Sae I rase , afore my ordinar ' time , and gaed back to my wark .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 32]: I had taen twa or three glasses o ' a dooms fine tipple they ca ' Madeira , an ' a moufu ' o ' cheese -- that was a ' .
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 121]: Weel , I sat doon to my catalogue there , as it micht be here ; but I hadna sat copyin ' the teetles o ' the buiks laid out upo ' the muckle table afore me , for mair nor twa minutes , whan I heard a kin ' o ' a reestlin ' , an ' I thocht it was mice , to whilk I 'm a deidly enemy ever sin they ate half o ' a first edition o ' the _ Fairy Queen _ , conteenin ' only the first three buiks , ye ken , o ' whilk they consumed an ' nae doot assimilated ae haill buik and full a half o ' anither .

Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 7]: I winna say what it was .

Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 14]: ` Dinna touch that buik , my bonny leddy , ' I cried .

Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 17]: Only she was gey sma ' for a seraph , though they 're nae ower big .

Weel , to mak a lang story short , and the shorter the better , for it 's nae a pleesant ane to me , she cam aftener and aftener .

Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 10]: Ye 'll be wonnerin ' what like she was .
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 51]: As I tell ' t ye , she was a wee body , wi ' muckle black een , that lay quaiet in her face and never cam oot till they war wantit , an ' a body gimp and sma ' , but roon ' and weel proportioned throughoot .

Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 16]: And she had a licht way wi ' her , that was jist dazin ' .
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 128]: She seemed to touch ilka thing wi ' the verra tips o ' her fingers , and syne ken a ` thing aboot it , as gin she had a universal insicht ; or raither , I wad say , her natur , notwithstandin ' its variety , was sae homogeneous , that whan ae nerve o ' her spiritual being cam in contack wi ' onything , the haill sowl o ' her cam in contack wi ' ' t at the same time and thereby ; and ilka pairt read the report efter its ain fashion , translatin ' ' t accordin ' to ` ts ain experience : as the different provinces and languages o ' the Chinese Empire read the universal written tongue .

Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 58]: But I ken nae mair than this : that for endless ages I gaed followin ' her through the heavenly halls , aye kennin as sure 's gospel that she was ahint the neist door , and aye openin ' that door upon an empty glory , to be equally certain that she was ahint the neist .

Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 7]: Alec was in a feverous glow .
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 44]: When they reached home , Mr Cupples went straight to the cupboard , swallowed a glass of the _ merum _ , put coals on the fire , drew his chair close to it , and said : `` It 's dooms cauld !
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 6]: Sit doon there , bantam .
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 6]: Pit on the kettle first .
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 19]: It 's an ac ' o ' the purest disinteresstitness , for deil a drap sall ye drink !
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 16]: But I 'll sing ye a sang , by way o ' upmak ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 10]: `` I never heard ye sing , Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 11]: Ye can do a ' thing , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 39]: `` I cudna gar a bonnie , high-born , white-handit leddy fa ' in love wi ' a puir futteret -LRB- weasel -RRB- o ' a crater -- a shargar -LRB- scrag -RRB- like Cosmo Cupples , bantam .
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 70]: But I can do twa or three things ; an ' ane o ' them is , I can mak ' a sang ; and anither is , I can mak ' a tune till ` t ; and a third is , I can sing the tane to the tither , that is whan I haena had either ower muckle or ower little o ' the tappit hen .
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 5]: Noo , heark ye .
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 14]: This ane 's a ' my ain : GAEIN ' AND COMIN ' .
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 29]: Whan Andrew frae Strathbogie gaed , The lift was lowerin ' dreary ; The sun he wadna lift his heid ; The win ' blew laich and eerie .
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 29]: In 's pouch he had a plack or twa , I vow he hadna mony ; Yet Andrew like a lintie sang , For Lizzie was sae bonny !
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 8]: O Lizzie , Lizzie , bonnie lassie !
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 5]: Bonnie , saucy hizzie !
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 16]: What richt had ye to luik at me , And drive me daft and dizzy ?
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 30]: Whan Andrew to Strathbogie cam ' , The sun was shinin ' rarely ; He rade a horse that pranced and sprang -- I vow he sat him fairly .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 35]: And he had gowd to spend and spare , And a heart as true as ony ; But 's luik was doon , and his sigh was sair , For Lizzie was sae bonny !
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 8]: O Lizzie , Lizzie , bonny hizzie !
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 7]: Ye 've turned the daylicht dreary .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 14]: Ye 're straucht and rare , ye 're fause and fair -- Hech !
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 7]: auld John Armstrong 's dearie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 12]: His voice was mellow , and ought to have been even .
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 5]: His expression was perfect .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 5]: The kettle was boiling .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 11]: Mr Cupples made his toddy , and resumed his story .
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 19]: `` As sune 's I was able , I left my mither greitin ' -- God bless her !
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 25]: -- and cam to this toon , for I wasna gaein ' to be eaten up with idleset as weel 's wi ' idolatry .
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 10]: The first thing I tuik till was teachin ' .
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 26]: Noo that 's a braw thing , whan the laddies and lassies want to learn , and hae questons o ' their ain to speir .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 12]: But whan they dinna care , it 's the verra deevil .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 9]: Or lang , a ` thing grew grey .
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 7]: I cared for naething and naebody .
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 28]: My verra dreams gaed frae me , or cam only to torment me , wi ' the reid hert o ' them changed to yallow and grey .
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 36]: `` Weel , ae nicht I had come hame worn oot wi ' warstlin ' to gar bairns eat that had no hunger , I spied upo ' the table a bottle o ' whusky .
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 29]: A frien ' o ' mine -- a grocer he was -- had sent it across the street to me , for it was hard upo ' Hogmanay .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 6]: I rang the bell incontinent .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 24]: Up comes the lass , and says I , ` Bell , lat 's hae a kettlefu ' o ' het water . '
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 18]: And to mak ' a lang story short , I could never want het water sin syne .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 29]: For I hadna drunken aboon a twa glaiss , afore the past began to revive as gin ye had come ower ' t wi ' a weet sponge .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 59]: A ' the colours cam ' oot upo ' ' t again , as gin they had never turned wan and grey ; and I said to mysel ' wi ' pride : ` My leddy canna , wi ' a ' her breedin ' and her bonnie skin , haud Cosmo Cupples frae lo'ein ' her . '
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 27]: And I followed aboot at her again throu a ' the oots and ins o ' the story , and the past was restored to me .
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 11]: -- That 's hoo it appeared to me that nicht .
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 28]: -- Was ' t ony wonner that the first thing I did whan I cam ' hame the neist nicht was to ring for the het water ?
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 24]: I wantit naething frae Providence or Natur ' but jist that the colour michtna be a ' ta'en oot o ' my life .
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 44]: The muckle deevil was i n't , that I cudna stan ' up to my fate like a man , and , gin my life was to cast the colour , jist tak my auld cloak aboot me , and gang on content .
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 4]: But I cudna .
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 14]: I bude to see things bonnie , or my strength gaed frae me .
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 11]: But ye canna slink in at back doors that gait .
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 11]: I was pitten oot , and oot I maun bide .
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 20]: It wasna that lang afore I began to discover that it was a ' a delusion and a snare .
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 37]: Whan I fell asleep , I wad dream whiles that , openin ' the door into ane o ' thae halls o ' licht , there she was stan ` in ' lauchin ' at me .
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 18]: And she micht hae gane on lauchin ' to a ' eternity -- for onything I cared .
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 45]: And -- ten times waur -- I wad whiles come upon her greitin ' and repentin ' , and haudin ' oot her han ' to me , and me carin ' no more for her than for the beard o ' a barley-stalk .
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 31]: And for makin ' a sang -- I jist steikit my lugs -LRB- stopped my ears -RRB- whan I heard a puir misguidit canary singin ' i ' the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 33]: And I begud to hear a laich lauch far awa ' , and it cam ' nearer and nearer ilka week , till it was ringin ' i ' my verra lug .
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 8]: But a ' that was naething compairateevely .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 42]: I ' the mids o ' a quaiet contemplation , suddenly , wi ' an awfu ' stoon , a ghaistly doobt pat it 's heid up i ' my breist , and cried : ` It 's a ' fause .
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 24]: The grey luik o ' life 's the true ane , and the only aspec ' ye hae a richt to see . '
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 14]: And efter that , a ' the whusky in Glenlivat cudna console me .
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 6]: -- Luik at me noo .
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 6]: Ye see what I am .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 15]: I can whiles sing an auld sang -- but mak ' a new ane !
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 5]: -- Lord , man !
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 16]: I can hardly believe ` at ever I made a sang i ' my life .
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 9]: Luik at my han ' hoo it trimles .
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 5]: Luik at my hert .

Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 13]: Gin it warna for buiks , I wad amaist cut my throat .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 39]: And the senawtus disna think me bye and aboon half a proper companion for buiks even ; as gin Cupples micht corrup ' Milton himsel , although he was ten feet ower his heid bottled in a buik .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 39]: And whan I saw ye poor oot the whusky in that mad-like mainner , as gin ' t had been some sma ' tipple o ' penny ale , it jist drave me mad wi ' anger . ''
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 26]: `` Weel , Mr Cupples , '' Alec ventured to say , `` what for dinna ye sen ' the bottle to the devil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 10]: `` What , my ain auld tappit hen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 32]: exclaimed Mr Cupples , with a sudden reaction from the seriousness of his late mood ; `` Na , na , she shanna gang to the deil till we gang thegither .
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 17]: but we 'll baith hae dry insides or we win frae him again , I doobt .
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 10]: That drouth 's an awfu ' thing to contemplate .
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 10]: But speyk o ' giein ' ower the drink !
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 18]: The verra attemp ' -- an ' dinna ye think that I haena made it -- aich !
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 11]: What for sud I gang to hell afore my time ?
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 8]: The deils themselves compleen o ' that .
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 4]: Na , na .
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 63]: Ance ye hae learned to drink , ye _ canna _ do wantin ' ` t. Man , dinna touch ` t. For God 's sake , for yer mither 's sake , for _ ony _ sake , dinna lat a drap o ' the hell-broth gang ower yer thrapple -- or ye 're damned like me for ever and ever .
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 23]: It 's as guid 's signin ' awa ' yer sowl wi ' yer ain han ' and yer ain blude . ''
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 30]: Mr Cupples lifted his glass , emptied it , and , setting it down on the table with a gesture of hatred , proceeded to fill it yet again .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXI .
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 23]: `` I say , Forbes , you keep yourself all to yourself and old Cupples , away there in the new town .
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 9]: Come and take some supper with me to-night .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 9]: It 's my birthday , old boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 16]: `` I do n't do much in that way , you know , Gibby . ''
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 7]: `` Oh yes , I know .
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 9]: You 're never jolly but amongst the shell-fish .
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 11]: At least that 's what the Venall thinks of you .
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 11]: But for once in a way you might come . ''
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 33]: `` Well , I do n't mind , '' said Alec , really not caring what came to him or of him , and glad of anything to occupy him with no-thinking .
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 7]: `` When shall I come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 4]: `` At seven .
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 8]: We 'll have a night of it .
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 5]: To-morrow 's Saturday . ''
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 9]: It was hardly worth while to go home .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 6]: He would not dine to-day .
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 12]: He would go and renew his grief by the ever-grieving sea .
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 26]: For his was a young love , and his sorrow was interesting to him : he embalmed his pangs in the amber of his consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 65]: So he crossed the links to the desolate sandy shore ; there let the sound of the waves enter the portals of his brain and fill all its hollow caves with their moaning ; and then wandering back to the old city , stood at length over the keystone of the bridge , and looked down into the dark water below the Gothic arch .
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 10]: He heard a footstep behind him on the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 6]: Looking round he saw Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 15]: Without reason or object , he walked up to him and barred his way .
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 7]: Beauchamp started , and drew back .
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 14]: `` Beauchamp , '' said Alec , `` you are my devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 14]: `` Granted , '' said Beauchamp , coolly , but on his guard .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 10]: `` What are you about with my cousin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 8]: `` What is that to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 7]: `` She is my cousin . ''
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 6]: `` I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 6]: She 's not mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 16]: `` If you play her false , as you have played me -- by heavens !
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 5]: -- '' `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 8]: I 'll be very kind to her .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 6]: You need n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 10]: I only wanted to take down your damned impudence .
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 10]: You may go to her when you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 15]: Alec 's answer was a blow , which Beauchamp was prepared for and avoided .
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 16]: Alec pursued the attack with a burning desire to give him the punishment he deserved .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 37]: But he turned suddenly sick , and , although he afterwards recalled a wrestle , knee to knee , the first thing he was aware of was the cold waters of the river closing over him .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 5]: The shock restored him .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 24]: When he rose to the surface he swam down the stream , for the banks were precipitous in the neighbourhood of the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 13]: At length he succeeded in landing , and set out for home .
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 23]: He had not gone far , however , before he grew very faint , and had to sit down on a door-step .
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 17]: Then he discovered that his arm was bleeding , and knew that Beauchamp had stabbed him .
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 18]: He contrived to tie it up after a fashion , and reached home without much more difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 7]: Mr Cupples had not come in .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 19]: So he got his landlady to tie up his arm for him , and then changed his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 33]: Fortunately the wound , although long and deep , ran lengthways between the shoulder and elbow , on the outside of the arm , and so was not of a serious character .
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 20]: After he was dressed , feeling quite well , he set off to keep his engagement with Gilbert Gordon .
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 18]: Now how could such a thing have taken place in the third decade of the nineteenth century ?
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 11]: -- The parapet was low and the struggle was fierce .
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 23]: I do not think that Beauchamp intended murder , for the consequences of murder must be a serious consideration to every gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 21]: He came of a wild race , with whom a word and a steel blow had been linked for ages .
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 6]: And habits transmitted become instincts .
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 46]: He was of a cold temperament , and such a nature , once roused , is often less under control than one used to excitement : a saint will sometimes break through the bonds of the very virtue which has gained him all his repute .
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 26]: If we combine these considerations with the known hatred of Beauchamp , the story Alec told Cupples the next day may become in itself credible .
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 38]: Whether Beauchamp tried to throw him from the bridge may remain doubtful , for when the bodies of two men are locked in the wrestle of hate , their own souls do not know what they intend .
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 35]: Beauchamp must have sped home with the conscience of a murderer ; and yet when Alec made his appearance in the class , most probably a revival of hatred was his first mental experience .
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 32]: But I have had no opportunity of studying the morbid anatomy of Beauchamp , and I do not care about him , save as he influences the current of this history .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 12]: When he vanishes , I shall be glad to forget him .
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 24]: Soon after Alec had left the house , Cupples came home with a hurried inquiry whether the landlady had seen anything of him .
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 58]: She told him as much as she knew , whereupon he went up-stairs to his schylus , & c. Alec said nothing about his adventure to any of his friends , for , like other Scotchmen young and old , he liked to keep things in his own hands till he knew what to do with them .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 56]: At first , notwithstanding his loss of blood , he felt better than he had felt for some time ; but in the course of the evening he grew so tired , and his brain grew so muddy and brown , that he was glad when he heard the order given for the boiling water .
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 51]: He had before now , although Mr Cupples had never become aware of the fact , partaken of the usual source of Scotch exhilaration , and had felt nothing the worse ; and now heedless of Mr Cupples 's elaborate warning -- how could he be expected to mind it ?
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 8]: -- he mixed himself a tumbler eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 55]: But although the earth brightened up under its influences , and a wider horizon opened about him than he had enjoyed for months before , yet half-frightened at the power of the beverage over his weakened frame , he had conscience enough to refuse a second tumbler , and rose early and went home .
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 25]: The moment he entered the garret , Mr Cupples , who had already consumed his nightly portion , saw that he had been drinking .
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 21]: He looked at him with blue eyes , wide-opened , dismay and toddy combining to render them of uncertain vision .
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 5]: `` Eh , bantam !
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 3]: bantam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 23]: he said , and sank back in his chair ; `` ye hae been at it in spite o ' me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 22]: And Mr Cupples burst into silent tears -- no unusual phenomenon in men under the combined influences of emotion and drink .
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 10]: Notwithstanding his own elevated condition , Alec was shocked .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 19]: `` Mr Cupples , '' he said , `` I want to tell you all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 6]: Mr Cupples took no notice .
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 43]: Alec began his story notwithstanding , and as he went on , his friend became attentive , inserting here and there an expletive to the disadvantage of Beauchamp , whose behaviour with regard to Kate he now learned for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 18]: When Alec had finished , Cupples said solemnly : `` I warned ye against him , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 18]: But a waur enemy nor Beauchamp has gotten a sickerer haud o ' ye , I doobt .
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 34]: Do ` at he like , Beauchamp 's dirk couldna hurt ye sae muckle as yer ain han ' , whan ye liftit the first glass to yer ain mou ' the nicht .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 8]: Ye hae despised a ' my warnings .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 41]: And sorrow and shame 'll come o ' ` t. And I 'll hae to beir a ' the wyte o ' ` t. Yer mither 'll jist hate me like the verra black taed that no woman can bide .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 7]: Gang awa ' to yer bed .
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 10]: I canna bide the sicht o ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 9]: Alec went to bed , rebuked and distressed .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 32]: But not having taken enough to hurt him much , he was unfortunately able , the next morning , to regard Mr Cupples 's lecture from a ludicrous point of view .
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 34]: And what danger was he in more than the rest of the fellows , few of whom would refuse a tumbler of toddy , and fewer of whom were likely to get drunk ?
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 24]: -- Had not Alec been unhappy , he would have been in less danger than most of them ; but he was unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 30]: And although the whisky had done him no great immediate injury , yet its reaction , combined with the loss of blood , made him restless all that day .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 33]: So that , when the afternoon came , instead of going to Mr Cupples in the library , he joined some of the same set he had been with the evening before .
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 20]: And when he came home , instead of going up-stairs to Mr Cupples , he went straight to bed .
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 19]: The next morning , while he was at breakfast , Mr Cupples made his appearance in his room .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 13]: `` What cam ' o ' ye last nicht , bantam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 9]: he asked kindly , but with evident uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 16]: `` I cam ' hame some tired , and gaed straucht to my bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 10]: `` But ye warna hame verra ear ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 7]: `` I wasna that late . ''
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 8]: `` Ye hae been drinkin ' again .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 11]: I ken by the luik o ' yer een . ''
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 7]: Alec had a very even temper .
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 14]: But a headache and a sore conscience together were enough to upset it .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 17]: To be out of temper with oneself is to be out of temper with the universe .
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 15]: `` Did my mother commission you to look after me , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 16]: he asked , and could have dashed his head against the wall the next moment .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 23]: But the look of pitying and yet deprecating concern in Mr Cupples 's face fixed him so that he could say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 16]: Mr Cupples turned and walked slowly away , with only the words : `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 2]: bantam !
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 2]: bantam !
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 13]: The Lord hae pity upo ' ye - and me too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 12]: He went out at the door bowed like an old man .
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 7]: `` Preserve 's , Mr Cupples !
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 5]: What ails ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 9]: exclaimed his landlady meeting him in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 13]: `` The whusky 's disagreed wi ' me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 21]: `` It 's verra ill-faured o ' ` t. I 'm sure I pay ' t ilka proper attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 12]: Then he went down the stairs , murmuring -- `` Rainbows !
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 2]: Rainbows !
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 6]: Naething for me but rainbows !
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 6]: God help the laddie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXII .
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 25]: It may appear strange to some of my renders that Alec should fall into this pit immediately upon the solemn warning of his friend .
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 22]: He had listened to the story alone ; he had never felt the warning : he had never felt the danger .
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 9]: Had he not himself in his own hands ?
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 7]: He was not fond of whisky .
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 8]: He could take it or leave it .
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 33]: And so he took it ; and finding that there was some comfort in it , took it again and again , seeking the society in which it was the vivifying element .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 66]: -- Need I depict the fine gradations by which he sank -- gradations though fine yet so numerous that , in a space of time almost too brief for credit , the bleared eye , the soiled garments , and the disordered hair , would reveal how the night had been spent , and the clear-browed boy looked a sullen , troubled , dissatisfied youth ?
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 14]: The vice had laid hold of him like a fast-wreathing , many-folded serpent .
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 8]: He had never had any conscious religion .
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 10]: His life had never looked up to its source .
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 15]: All that was good in him was good of itself , not of him .
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 20]: So it was easy to go down , with grief staring at him over the edge of the pit .
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 31]: All return to the unific rectitude of a manly life must be in the face of a scorching past and a dank future -- and those he could not face .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 30]: And as his life thus ebbed away from him , his feelings towards Beauchamp grew more and more bitter , approximating in character to those of Beauchamp towards him .
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 31]: And he soon became resolved to have his revenge on him , though it was long before he could make up his mind as to what the revenge should be .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 5]: Beauchamp avoided him constantly .
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 8]: And Mr Cupples was haunting him unseen .
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 61]: The strong-minded , wise-headed , weak-willed little poet , wrapped in a coat of darkness , dogged the footsteps of a great handsome , good-natured , ordinary-gifted wretch , who _ could _ never make him any return but affection , and had now withdrawn all interchange of common friendship in order that he might go the downward road unchecked .
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 6]: Cupples was driven almost distracted .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 21]: He drank harder than ever , but with less satisfaction than ever , for he only grew the more miserable .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 45]: He thought of writing to Alec 's mother , but , with the indecision of a drunkard , he could not make up his mind , and pondered over every side of the question , till he was lost in a maze of incapacity .
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 5]: Bad went to worse .
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 5]: Vice grew upon vice .
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 13]: There are facts in human life which human artists can not touch .
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 27]: The great Artist can weave them into the grand whole of his Picture , but to the human eye they look too ugly and too painful .
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 13]: Even the man who can do the deeds dares not represent them .
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 18]: Mothers have to know such facts of their sons , and such facts of women like themselves .
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 40]: Alec had fallen amongst a set of men who would not be satisfied till he should be as low as they -- till there should be nothing left in him to remind them that they had once been better .
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 14]: The circle in which he began to drink had gradually contracted about him .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 48]: The better sort had fallen away , and the worse had remained -- chiefly older men than he , men who had come near to the enjoyment of vileness for its own sake , if that be possible , and who certainly enjoyed making others like themselves .
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 32]: Encouraged by their laughter and approbation , Alec began to emulate them , and would soon have had very little to learn if things had not _ taken a turn _ .
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 15]: A great hand is sometimes laid even on the fly-wheel of life 's engine .
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 33]: Andrew Constable , with his wife and old-fashioned child Isie , was seated at tea in the little parlour opening from the shop , when he was called out by a customer .
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 22]: He remained longer than was likely to be accounted for by the transaction of business at that time of the day .
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 10]: And when he returned his honest face looked troubled .
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 6]: `` Wha was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 4]: asked his wife .
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 21]: it was naebody but Jeames Johnston , wantin ' a bit o ' flannin for 's wife 's coatie . ''
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 21]: `` And what had he to say ` at keepit ye till yer tay 's no fit to drink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 7]: my tay 'll do weel eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 9]: It 's nae by ordinar ' cauld . ''
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 7]: `` But what said he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 3]: `` Weel !
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 2]: hm !
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 2]: hm !
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 10]: -- He said it was fine frosty weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 6]: `` Ay , nae doobt !
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 10]: He kent that by the way the shuttle flew .
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 6]: Was that a ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 6]: `` Na , nae freely .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 12]: But cogues hae lugs , and bairns hae muckle een . ''
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 34]: For Isie sat on her stool staring at her father and mother alternately , and watching for the result of her mother 's attempt at picking the lock of her father 's reticence .
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 30]: But the moment she heard the word _ lugs _ , she knew that she had no chance , and her eyes grew less and their pupils grew larger .
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 19]: Fearing he had hurt her , Andrew said , `` Winna ye hae a starnie jam , Isie ?
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 5]: It 's grosert-jam . ''
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 8]: `` Na , thank ye , daddie .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 18]: Maybe it wad gie me a sair wame , '' answered the solemn old-faced Scotchwoman of seven .
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 31]: A child who refuses jam lest it should serve her as the little book did the Apostle John , might be considered prudent enough to be intrusted with a secret .
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 34]: But not a word more was said on the subject , till Isie was in bed , and supposed to be fast asleep , in a little room that opened off the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 6]: But she was not asleep .
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 20]: And the door was always left open , that she might fall asleep in the presence of her parents .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 39]: Their words therefore flowed freely into her ears , although the meaning only played on her mind with a dull glimmer like that which played on her wall from the fire in the room where they sat talking .
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 26]: `` Ay , woman , '' began Andrew , `` it 'll be sair news , this , to the lady ower the watter . ''
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 11]: `` Ye dinna mean Mistress Forbes , Anerew ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 8]: ` Deed I mean jist her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 7]: `` Is ' t her son ?
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 8]: Has he met wi ' ony mischeef ?
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 6]: What 's happent till him ?
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 7]: Is he droont , or killt ?
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 5]: The Lord preserve 's !
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 13]: She 'll dee o ' ` t. '' `` Na , lass .
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 11]: It 's a hantle waur nor a ' that . ''
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 45]: The woodcuts in Fox 's _ Book of Martyrs _ , of which three folio volumes in black letter lay in the room whence the conversation flowed to Isie 's ears , rose in all their hideousuess before the mental vision of the child .
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 16]: In no other way than as torture could she conceive of worse than being killed .
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 15]: `` Ye gar me grue , '' said Mrs Constable , with a shudder .
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 58]: `` Ay , woman , ye ken little o ' the wickedness o ' great toons -- hoo they lie in wait at ilka corner , wi ' their gins and their snares and their pits that they howk to catch the unwary yowth , '' said Andrew , in something of the pride of superior knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 28]: From this elevation , however , he was presently pulled down in a rather ignominious fashion by his more plain-spoken though not a whit more honest wife .
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 29]: `` Anerew , dinna ye mint -LRB- aim -RRB- at speikin ' like a chapter o ' the Proverbs o ' Solomon , the son o ' Dawvid .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 26]: Say straucht oot ` at thae coorse jawds that hing aboot i ' the gloamin ' hae gotten a grip o ' the bonnie lad .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 22]: but he 'll fair ill ; and the Lord hae mercy upo ' him -- and nane upo ' them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 3]: `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 2]: hoot !
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 10]: lass ; dinna speik wi ' sic a venom .
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 11]: Ye ken wha says _ Vengeance is mine _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 8]: `` Ay , ay , weel eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 14]: And I houp He 'll tak 's ain upo ' sic brazen hizzies .
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 18]: You men-fowk think ye ken a hantle o ' things that ye wad haud us ohn kent .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 25]: But nane kens the wiles o ' a wumman , least awa them ` at fa 's into them , but anither wumman . ''
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 27]: `` It 's nae savin ' lore , '' said Andrew , a little troubled that his wife should assert a familiar acquaintance with such things .
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 5]: But she went on .
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 7]: `` Women 's jist dreidfu ' .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 17]: Whan ance they gang the ill gait , they 're neither to haud nor bin ' .
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 50]: And to think o ' them layin ' han 's upo ' sic a bonnie weel-behaved laddie as that Alec Forbes , a ceevil , herty cratur , wi ' a kin ' word an ' a joke even for the beggar ` at he geid a bawbee till !
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 33]: Weel , he 'll come oot o ' their cluiks , maybe no that nmckle the waur efter a ' , as mony a man frae King Dawvid doonwith afore him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 6]: `` Noo , wumman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 41]: said Andrew , in a tone of authority blended with rising indignation ; `` ye 're slidin ' aff o ' yer ain stule , and ye 'll be upo ' the grun ' afore ye win on to mine .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 70]: Richt or wrang aboot the women , I bude to ken mair aboot the men nor ye do ; and I daur affirm and uphaud that never man cam ' oot o ' the grip o ' thae poor deluded craters -- '' Mrs Constable interposed with one single emphatic epithet , not admittable to the ears of this generation ; but Andrew resumed , and went on . ''
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 29]: -- poor deluded craters , withoot losin ' a great pairt o ' what was left in him o ' the eemage o ' God efter the fall .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 11]: Woman , he tynes -LRB- loses -RRB- a heap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 12]: `` Hoo sud ye ken onything aboot that , Anerew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 5]: returned his wife sharply .
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 20]: `` The same way than ye ken sae weel aboot the she side o ' the queston , lass .
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 15]: We may jist enlichten ane anither a wee aboot some things , mayhap . ''
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 19]: Meantime the ears of the little pitcher in bed had been growing longer and longer with curious horror .
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 45]: The something in itself awfully vague about Alec 's fate was wrapt in yet deeper clouds of terror and mystery by the discord of opinion with regard to it on the part of her father and mother , whom she had rarely heard differ .
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 37]: She pictured to herself the image of his Maker being scratched off Alec by the claws of furies ; and hot pincers tearing nail after nail from the hand which had once given her a penny .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 50]: And her astonishment was therefore paralyzing when she heard her father say : `` But ye maun haud a quaiet tongue i ' yer heid , guidwife ; for weel as ye like the laddie , ye may blast his character gin ye say a word aboot it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 26]: `` I s ' warran ' it 's a ' ower Glamerton afore it comes to your lugs , Anerew , '' returned her mother .
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 10]: `` They 're no that gleg efter sic news .
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 28]: But I wad like sair to ken wha sent hame the word o ' ` t. '' `` I 'm thinking it 's been young Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 10]: `` The Lord be praised for a lee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs Constable .
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 50]: `` Haena I tell ' t ye afore noo , sae that it 's no upmak to pick the lock o ' the occasion , Anerew , that Rob Bruce has a spite at that faimily for takin ' sic a heap o ' notice o ' Annie Annerson .
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 33]: And I wadna wonner gin he had set 's hert upo ' merryin ' her upo ' 's ain Rob , and sae keepin ' her bit siller i ' the faimily .
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 20]: Gin that be sae , he micht weel gie Alec Forbes a back-handit cloot -LRB- blow -RRB- . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 3]: ` Deed !
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 4]: maybe , gudewife .
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 37]: He 's a burnin ' and a shinin ' licht amo ' you missioners , though ; and ye maunna say ill o ' 'm , for fear he has ye up afore the kirk . ''
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 7]: `` Ay , deed is he !
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 62]: He 's a burnin ' shame , and a stinkin ' lamp ; for the grace o ' God wasna hauden to the nib o ' 'm lang eneuch to set him in a low -LRB- flame -RRB- , but only lang eneuch to gar the ile o ' 'm reek fit to scomfish -LRB- suffocate -RRB- a haill Sodom . ''
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 5]: `` Hoot , lass !
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 9]: Ye 're ower sair even upo ' him .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 27]: But it 's verra true that gin the story cam ' frae that en ' o ' the toon , there 's room for rizzonable doobts .
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 25]: Sae we 'll awa ' to our beds , and houp things mayna be sae far gane as the soun ' o ' them .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 14]: Only I drede there 's aye some water whaur the stirkie droons . ''
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 33]: It was long before little Isie got to sleep , what with attempting to realize the actual condition of Alec Forbes , and trying to excogitate the best means for his deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 15]: Why should not all Glamerton set out in a body with flails and pitchforks ?
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 41]: And if she must not meddle for that , seeing her father had said the matter must not be mentioned , yet his prohibition could not include Alec 's mother , whom it would be wicked to keep in ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 22]: For what would Isie think if she was taken prisoner by a cruel woman and they would not tell her mother ?
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 22]: So she fell asleep , to wake in the morning with the sense of a mission upon her important little mind .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 68]: What rendered it probable that the rumour came from `` that end of the town '' was , that Bruce the younger was this year a bejan at Alec 's college , and besides was the only other scion of Glamerton there grafted , so that any news about Alec other than he would care to send himself , must in all likelihood have come through him .
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 49]: -- For Bruce the elder had determined that in his son he would restore the fallen fortunes of the family , giving him such an education as would entitle him to hold up his head with the best , and especially with that proud upstart , Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 13]: The news had reached Thomas Crann , and filled him with concern .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 39]: He had , as was his custom in trouble , betaken himself straightway to `` the throne of grace , '' and `` wrestled in prayer '' with God that he would restore the prodigal to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 77]: What would Thomas have thought if he had been told that his anxiety , genuine as it was , that his love , true as it was , did not come near the love and anxiety of another man who spent his evenings in drinking whisky and reading heathen poets , and who , although he knew not a little of his Bible , never opened it from one end of the year to the other ?
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 113]: If he had been told that Cosmo Cupples had more than once , after the first tumbler of toddy and before the second , betaken himself to his prayers for his poor Alec Forbes , and entreated God Almighty to do for him what he could not do , though he would die for him -- to rescue him from the fearful pit and the miry clay of moral pollution -- if he had heard this , he would have said that it was a sad pity , but such prayers could not be answered , seeing he that prayed was himself in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 12]: There was much shaking of the head amongst the old women .
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 12]: Many an ejaculation and many a meditative _ eh me _ !
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 39]: were uttered over Alec 's fall ; and many a word of tender pity for his poor mother floated forth on the frosty air of Glamerton ; but no one ventured to go and tell the dreary tidings .
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 34]: The men left it to the women ; and the woman knew too well how the bearer of such ill news would appear in her eyes , to venture upon the ungracious task .
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 26]: So they said to themselves she must know it just as well as they did ; or if she did not know , poor woman !
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 14]: she would know time enough for all the good it would do her .
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 9]: And that came of sending sons to colleges !
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 6]: & c. , & c .
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 22]: But there was just one not so easily satisfied about the extent of her duties : that was little Isie Constable .
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 15]: The tertians gave a supper at Luckie Cumstie 's , and invited the magistrands .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 22]: On such an occasion Beauchamp , with his high sense of his own social qualities , would not willingly be absent .
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 16]: When the hour arrived , he took his place near the head of the table .
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 49]: After all the solid and a part of the liquid entertainment was over , Alec rose in the space between two toasts , and said : `` Mr Chairman and gentlemen , I propose , at my own proper cost , to provide something for your amusement . ''
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 8]: Beauchamp and all stared at the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 25]: `` It is to be regretted , '' Alec went on , `` that students have no court of honour to which to appeal .
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 28]: This is the first opportunity I have had of throwing myself on the generosity of my equals , and asking them to listen to my story . ''
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 9]: The interest of the company was already roused .
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 26]: All the heads about the long table leaned towards the speaker , and cries of _ hear , hear _ , arose in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 16]: Alec then gave a brief statement of the facts of the encounter upon the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 32]: This was the only part of his relations with Beauchamp which he chose to bring before the public ; for the greater wrong of lying defamation involved his cousin 's name .
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 29]: He told how Beauchamp had sought the encounter by deliberate insult , had used a weapon against an unarmed enemy , and then thrown him from the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 46]: `` Now , '' he concluded , `` all I ask of you , gentlemen , is to allow me the fair arena of your presence while I give this sneaking chieftain the personal chastisement which he has so richly merited at my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 14]: Beauchamp had soon recovered his self-possession after the first surprise of the attack .
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 24]: He sat drinking his toddy all the time Alec spoke , and in the middle of his speech he mixed himself another tumbler .
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 45]: When Alec sat down , he rose , glanced round the assembly , bent his lip into its most scornful curves , and , in a clear , unwavering voice , said : `` Mr Chairman and gentlemen , I repel the accusation . ''
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 8]: Alec started to his feet in wrath .
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 21]: `` Mr Forbes , sit down , '' bawled the chairman ; and Alec obeyed , though with evident reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 12]: `` I say the accusation is false , '' repeated Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 29]: `` I do not say that Mr Forbes consciously invented the calumny in order to take away my character : such an assertion would preclude its own credence .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 18]: Nor do I venture to affirm that he never was stabbed , or thrown into the river .
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 73]: But I ask any gentleman who happens to be aware of Mr Forbes 's devotions at the shrine of Father Lyaeus , which is the more likely -- that a fellow-student should stab and throw him into the water , or that , as he was reeling home at midnight , the treacherous divinity of the bowl should have handed him over to the embrace of his brother deity of the river .
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 16]: Why then should even his imagination fix upon me as the source of the injury ?
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 55]: Gentlemen , a foolish attachment to the customs of a long line of ancestors has led me into what I find for the first time to be a dangerous habit -- that of wearing arms ; -- dangerous , I mean , to myself ; for now I am wounded with my own weapon .
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 17]: But the real secret of the affair is -- I am ashamed to say -- jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 22]: Mr Forbes knows what I say to be true -- that a lady whom he loves prefers me to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 12]: `` Do n't bring her name in , you brute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 19]: roared Alec , starting again to his feet , `` or I 'll tear your tongue out . ''
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 14]: `` You hear , gentlemen , '' said Beauchamp , and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 4]: A murmur arose .
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 5]: Heads gathered into groups .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 5]: No one stood up .
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 22]: Alec felt with the deepest mortification that his adversary 's coolness and his own violence had turned the scale against him .
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 38]: This conviction , conjoined with the embarrassment of not knowing how to say a word in his own defence without taking some notice of the close of his adversary 's speech , fixed him to his seat .
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 25]: For he had not yet fallen so low as to be capable of even alluding to the woman he loved in such an assembly .
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 10]: He would rather abandon the field to his adversary .
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 47]: Probably not many seconds had passed , but his situation was becoming intolerable , when a well-known voice rose clear above the confused murmur ; and glancing to the lower end of the room , he saw Cosmo Cupples standing at the end of the table .
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 22]: `` I ken weel eneuch , gentlemen , '' he said , `` that I hae no richt to be here .
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 13]: Ye a ' ken me by the sicht o ' the een .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 18]: I 'm a graduate o ' this university , and at present your humble servant the librarian .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 25]: I intrude for the sake o ' justice , and I cast mysel ' upo ' your clemency for a fair hearin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 26]: This being accorded by general acclamation , `` Gentlemen , '' he resumed , `` I stan ' afore ye wi ' a sair hert .
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 76]: I hae occupied the position o ' tutor to Mr Forbes ; for , as Sir Pheelip Sidney says in a letter to his brither Rob , wha was efterwards Yerl o ' Leicester upo ' the demise o ' Robert Dudley , ` Ye may get wiser men nor yersel ' to converse wi ' ye and instruck ye , in ane o ' twa ways -- by muckle ootlay or muckle humility . '
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 37]: Noo , that laddie was ane o ' the finest naturs I ever cam ' across , and his humility jist made it a pleesur to tak ' chairge o ' 'm baith mentally and morally .
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 20]: That I had a sair doon come whan he took to the drink , I am forced to confess .
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 13]: But I aye thocht he was strauchtforet , notwithstandin ' the whusky .
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 11]: I wasna prepared for sic a doonfa ' as this .
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 22]: -- I maun jist confess , Mr Cheerman , that I heard him throu ' the crack o ' the door-cheek .
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 13]: And he broucht sic deevilich accusations -- '' `` Mr Cupples ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 3]: cried Alec .
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 15]: `` Haud yer tongue , Alec Forbes , and lat this company hear me .
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 13]: Ye appealed to the company yersel ' first o ' a ' .
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 29]: -- I say hoo cud he bring sic deevilich accusations against a gentleman o ' sic birth and breedin ' and accomplishments as the Laird o ' Chattachan !
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 57]: -- Maybe the Laird wad jist condescend to say whaur he was upo ' the nicht in queston ; for gin we cud get the rampaugin ' misguidit laddie ance fairly into the yard , wi ' the yetts steekit -LRB- gates closed -RRB- , he wad see that leein ' wadna serve his turn . ''
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 6]: Alec was in chaotic confusion .
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 20]: Notwithstanding the hard words Mr Cupples had used , he could ill believe that he had turned his enemy .
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 18]: He had behaved very badly to Mr Cupples , but was Mr Cupples one to revenge himself ?
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 11]: Mr Cupples had paused with his eyes resting on Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 25]: He , without rising , replied carelessly : `` Really , sir , I do not keep a register of my goings and comings .
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 11]: I might have done so had I known its importance .
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 17]: I have not even been informed when the occurrence is said to have taken place . ''
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 15]: `` I can gie your memory a prod upo ' the dates , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 37]: For I ken weel the nicht whan Alec Forbes cam ' hame wi ' a lang and a deep cut upo ' the ootside o ' 's left airm atween the shouther an ' the elbuck .
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 66]: I may weel remember ' t to my grief ; for though he cam ' hame as sober as he was drippin ' weet -- I hae oor guidwife 's testimony to that -- he gaed oot again , and whan he cam ' hame ance mair , he was the waur o ' drink for the first time sin ' ever I kent him .
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 36]: Noo , sir , it a ' took place the same day that ye cam ' to the leebrary , and tuik awa ' wi ' ye a novell ca 'd _ Aiken Drum _ .
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 17]: I tauld ye it wad ill repay ye , for it was but a fule thing .
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 32]: And I remember ' t the better that I was expeckin ' Alec Forbes in ilka minute , and I was feared for a collieshangie -LRB- outbreak -RRB- atween ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 17]: `` I remember all about that night perfectly , now you call it to my recollection .
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 24]: I went straight home , and did not go out again -- I was so taken up with _ Aiken Drum _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 9]: `` I tell ' t ye sae ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 5]: cried Cupples , triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 12]: `` Wha wadna tak ' the word o ' The MacChattachan ?
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 54]: There 's sma ' profit in addin ' my testimony to the weight o ' that ; but I wad jist like to tell this company , Mr Cheerman and gentlemen , hoo I cam ' to ken mair aboot the affair nor my frien ' Alec Forbes is awar ' o ' .
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 46]: That same efternoon , I expeckit him i ' the leebrary as I hae said , and whan he didna come , I took my hat -- that was about a half-hoor efter the laird left me -- and gaed oot to luik for him .
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 76]: I gaed ower the links ; for my man had the profitless habit at that time , whilk he 's gien up for a mair profitless still , o ' stravaguin ' aboot upo ' the seashore , wi ' 's han 's in 's pooches , and his chin reposin ' upo ' the third button o ' 's waistcoat -- all which bears hard upo ' what the laird says aboot 's jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 30]: The mune was jist risin ' by the time I wan to the shore , but I saw no sign o ' man or woman alang that dreary coast .
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 24]: I was jist turnin ' to come hame again , whan I cam ' upo ' tracks i ' the weet san ' .
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 29]: And I kent the prent o ' the fit , and I followed it on to the links again , and sae I gaed back at my leisure .
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 48]: And it was sic a bonny nicht , though the mune wasna that far up , drivin ' lang shaidows afore her , that I thocht I wad jist gang ance ower the brig and back again , and syne maybe turn into Luckie Cumstie 's here .
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 37]: But afore I wan to the brig , whan I was i ' the shaidow o ' Baillie Bapp 's hoose , I heard sic a scushlin ' and a shochlin ' upo ' the brig !
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 46]: and I saw something gang reelin ' aboot ; and afore I cud gaither my wits and rin foret , I heard an awfu ' splash i ' the water ; and by gangs somebody wi ' lang quaiet strides , and never saw me .
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 13]: He had on the kilts and the lave o ' the fandangles .
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 94]: And he turned into the quadrangle , and throu ' t he gaed and oot at the corner o ' ` t. I was close ahint him -- that is , I was into the quadrangle afore he was oot o ' ` t. And I saw the sacrist come oot at the door o ' the astronomical tooer jist afore the Hielanman turned the neuk o ' ` t. And I said to Thomson , says I , ` Wha was that gaed by ye , and oot the back gait ? '
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 11]: And says he , ` It was Maister Beauchamp . '
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 9]: ` Are ye sure o ' that ? '
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 12]: says I. ` As sure 's deith , ' says he .
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 9]: Ye ken William 's phrase , gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 9]: Beauchamp 's nonchalance had disappeared for some time .
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 22]: When his own name came out , his cheeks grew deathly pale , and thin from the falling of his jaw .
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 8]: Cupples , watching him , went on .
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 25]: `` As sune 's I was sure o ' my man , I saw what a damned idiot I was to rin efter him .
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 19]: And back I flew to the brig. I kent full weel wha the ither man bude to be .
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 53]: It could be nane but my ain Alec Forbes ; for I sweir to ye , gentlemen , I hae watched The MacChattachan watchin ' Alec Forbes mair nor twa or three times sin ' Alec throosh him for bein ' foul-mou 'd i ' the face o ' the deid . ''
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 21]: By this time Beauchamp , having swallowed the rest of his tumbler at a gulp , had recovered a little .
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 8]: He rose with defiance on his face .
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 23]: `` Dinna lat him gang , gentlemen , '' cried Cupples , `` till I tell ye ae ither God 's trowth .
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 46]: -- I ran back to the brig , as hard 's my legs cud carry me , consolin ' mysel ' wi ' the reflection that gin Alec had na been sair hurtit i ' the scuffle , there was no fear o ' him .
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 25]: For I heard him fa ' clean into the water , and I kent ye micht as sune droon a herrin as Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 36]: I ran richt to the mids ' o ' the brig and there was the black heid o ' him bobbin ' awa ' doon the water i ' the hert o ' the munelicht .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 7]: I 'm terrible lang-sichtit , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 43]: I canna sweir that I saw the face o ' 'm , seein ' the back o ' 's heid was to me ; but that it was Alec Forbes , I hae no more doobt than o ' my ain existence .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 48]: I was jist turnin ' , nearhan ' the greetin ' , for I lo'ed the laddie weel , whan I saw something glintin ' bonnie upo ' the parapet o ' the brig. And noo I beg to restore ' t till ` ts richtful owner .
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 11]: Wad ye pass ' t up the table , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 19]: Some o ' ye will recogneeze ' t as ane o ' the laird 's bonnie cairngorum-buttons . ''
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 24]: Handing the button to the man nearest him , Mr Cupples withdrew into a corner , and leaned his back against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 27]: The button made many a zigzag from side to side of the table , but Beauchamp saw the yellow gleam of it coming nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 6]: It seemed to fascinate him .
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 30]: At last bursting the bonds of dismay , the blood rushed into his pale face , and he again moved to go : `` A conspiracy , gentlemen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 7]: `` You are all against me .
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 10]: I will not trouble you longer with my presence .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 7]: I will bide my time . ''
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 23]: `` Stop a moment , Mr Beauchamp , '' said the chairman - the pale-faced son of a burly ploughman - rising .
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 9]: `` Your departure will scarcely satisfy us now .
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 17]: Gentlemen , form yourselves in a double row , and grace the exit of a disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 16]: I leave it to yourselves to kick him or not as you may think proper .
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 14]: But I think myself the way is to be merciful to the confounded .
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 9]: Better leave him to his own conscience . ''
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 17]: Beauchamp 's hand , following its foolish habit , fell upon the hilt of his dirk .
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 31]: `` Draw that dirk one inch , '' said the chairman hastily , clenching his fist , `` and I 'll have you thrown on Luckie Cumstie 's midden . ''
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 5]: Beauchamp 's hand dropped .
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 6]: The men formed as directed .
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 9]: `` Now , '' said the chairman sternly .
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 20]: And Beauchamp without a word marched down the long avenue white as a ghost , and looking at nobody .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 31]: Each made him a low bow as he passed , except the wag of the tertians , who turned his back on him and bowed to the universe in general .
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 12]: Mr Cupples was next the door , and bowed him out .
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 5]: Alec alone stood erect .
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 6]: He could not insult him .
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 10]: Beauchamp 's feelings I do not care to analyze .
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 13]: As he passes from that room , he passes from my history .
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 24]: - I do not think a man with such an unfavourable start , could arrive at the goal of repentance in this life .
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 25]: `` Mr Cupples , '' cried the chairman , `` will you oblige us by spending the rest of the evening with us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 44]: `` You do me mair honour nor I deserve , sir , '' replied Mr Cupples ; `` but that villain Alec Forbes has cost me sae muckle in drink to haud my hert up , that I winna drink in his company .
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 12]: I micht tak ' ower muckle and disgrace mysel ' forbye .
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 15]: Good nicht to ye a ' , gentlemen , and my best thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 23]: So saying , Mr Cupples left the room before Alec could get near him with a word or a sign of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 13]: But sorry and ashamed as he was , his spirits soon returned .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 22]: Congratulation restored him to his worse self ; and ere long he felt that he had deserved well of the community .
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 36]: The hostess turned him out with the last few at midnight , for one of the professors was provost ; and he went homewards with another student , who also lived in the new town .
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 38]: The two , however , not having had enough of revelry yet , turned aside into a lane , and thence up a court leading to a low public-house , which had a second and worse reputation .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 7]: Into this Alec 's companion went .
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 3]: Alec followed .
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 14]: But he was suddenly seized in the dark , and ejected with violence .
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 17]: Recovering himself from his backward stagger into the court , he raised his arm to strike .
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 17]: Before him stood a little man , who had apparently followed him out of the public-house .
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 23]: His hands were in the pockets of his trowsers , and the wind was blowing about the tails of his old dress-coat .
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 10]: Nor was Alec too far gone to recognize him .
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 7]: `` You , Mr Cupples ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 10]: `` I didna expect to see you here . ''
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 38]: `` I never was across the door-sill o ' sic a place afore , '' said Mr Cupples , `` nor , please God , will either you or me ever cross sic a door-sill again . ''
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 8]: `` Hooly , hooly , Mr Cupples !
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 7]: Speak for ane at a time .
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 7]: I 'm gaein in this minute .
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 13]: Luckie Cumstie turned on the caller air ower sune for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 4]: `` Man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 18]: said Cupples , laying hold of Alec 's coat , `` think that ye hae a mither .
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 17]: Ilka word that ye hear frae a worthless woman is an affront to yer mither . ''
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 9]: `` Dinna stan ' preachin ' to me .
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 6]: I 'm past that . ''
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 21]: `` Alec , ye 'll wiss to God ye hadna , whan ye come to marry a bonnie wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 8]: It was a true but ill-timed argument .
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 5]: Alec flared up wildly .
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 4]: `` Wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 11]: he cried , `` there 's no wife for me .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 7]: Haud oot o ' my gait .
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 9]: Dinna ye see I hae been drinkin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 7]: And I winna be contred . ''
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 5]: `` Drinkin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 8]: `` Little ye ken aboot drinkin ' .
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 10]: I hae drunken three times as muckle as you .
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 30]: And gin that be ony argument for me haudin ' oot o ' your gait , it 's mair argument yet for you to haud oot o ' mine .
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 12]: I sweir to God I winna stan ' this ony langer .
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 22]: Ye 're to come hame wi ' me frae this mou ' o ' hell and ugsome -LRB- frightful -RRB- deith .
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 10]: It gangs straucht to the everlastin ' burnin 's .
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 4]: Eh , man !
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 13]: to think nae mair o ' women nor _ that _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 26]: And the brave little man placed himself right between Alec and the door , which now opened half-way , showing several peering and laughing faces .
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 37]: But the opposition of Mr Cupples had increased the action of the alcohol upon Alec 's brain , and he blazed up in a fury at the notion of being made a laughter to the women .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 36]: He took one step towards Mr Cupples , who had restored his hands to his pockets and backed a few paces towards the door of the house , to guard against Alec 's passing him .
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 19]: `` Haud oot o ' my gait , or I 'll gar ye , '' he said fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 20]: `` I will not , '' answered Mr Cupples , and lay senseless on the stones of the court .
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 13]: Alec strode into the house , and the door closed behind him .
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 9]: By slow degrees Mr Cupples came to himself .
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 14]: He was half dead with cold , and his head was aching frightfully .
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 11]: A pool of blood lay on the stones already frozen .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 22]: He crawled on his hands and knees , till he reached a wall , by which he raised and steadied himself .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 35]: Feeling along this wall , he got into the street ; but he was so confused and benumbed that if a watchman had not come up , he would have died on some doorstep .
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 9]: The man knew him and got him home .
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 31]: He allowed both him and his landlady to suppose that his condition was the consequence of drink ; and so was helped up to his garret and put to bed .
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXV .
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 47]: All the night during which Isie Constable lay dreaming of racks , pincers , screws , and Alec Forbes , the snow was busy falling outside , shrouding the world once more ; so that next day the child could not get out upon any pretence .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 47]: Had she succeeded in escaping from the house , she might have been lost in the snow , or drowned in the Glamour , over which there was as yet only a rude temporary bridge to supply the place of that which had been swept away .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 21]: But although very uneasy at the obstruction of her projects , she took good care to keep her own counsel .
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 9]: - The snow was very obstinate to go .
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 25]: At length , after many days , she was allowed to go out with stockings over her shoes , and play in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 29]: No sooner was she alone , than she darted out of the garden by the back-gate , and before her mother missed her , was crossing the Glamour .
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 18]: She had never been so far alone , and felt frightened ; but she pushed bravely forward .
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 36]: Mrs Forbes and Annie Anderson were sitting together when Mary put her head in at the door and told her mistress that the daughter of Mr Constable , the clothier , wanted to see her .
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 12]: `` Why , she 's a mere infant , Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 5]: exclaimed Mrs Forbes . ''
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 21]: ` Deed is she , mem ; but she 's nane the less doon the stair i ' the kitchie .
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 14]: Ye wad hae seen her come yersel ' but she 's ower wee .
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 25]: Ye cudna get a glimp o ' her ower the edge o ' the snaw i ' the cuttin ' doon to the yett .
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 8]: Hoo her fowk cud lat her oot !
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 34]: She 's a puir wee white-faced elf o ' a crater , but she 's byous auld-farrand and wise-like , and naething will do but she maun see yersel ' , mem . ''
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 7]: `` Bring her up , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 4]: Poor little thing !
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 6]: What can she want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 11]: Presently Isie entered the room , looking timidly about her .
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 12]: `` Well , my dear , what do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 16]: `` It 's aboot Alec , mem , '' said Isie , glancing towards Annie .
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 8]: `` Well , what about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 20]: asked Mrs Forbes , considerably bewildered , but not fearing bad news from the mouth of such a messenger .
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 11]: `` Hae ye heard naething aboot him , mem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 4]: `` Nothing particular .
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 11]: I have n't heard from him for a fortnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 10]: `` That 's easy accoontit for , mem . ''
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 9]: `` What do you mean , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 4]: Speak out . ''
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 25]: `` Weel , mem , the way I heard it was raither particlar , and I wadna like a ` body to ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 7]: Here she glanced again at Annie .
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 16]: `` You need n't be afraid of Annie Anderson , '' said Mrs Forbes smiling .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 10]: `` Weel , mem , I didna richtly ken .
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 61]: But they hae ta'en him intil a dreidfu ' place , and whether they hae left a haill inch o ' skin upon 's body , is mair nor I can tell ; but they hae rackit him , and pu 'd o ' 's nails aff , maybe them a ' , and - '' `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 35]: exclaimed Mrs Forbes , with a most unusual inclination to hysterics , seeing something terrible peep from behind the grotesque report of Isie , `` what _ do _ you mean , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 15]: `` I 'm tellin ' ye ' t as I heard it , mem .
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 8]: I houp they haena brunt him yet .
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 15]: Ye maun gang and tak ' him oot o ' their han 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 6]: `` Whose hands , child ?
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 9]: Who 's doing all this to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 49]: `` They stan ' aboot the corners o ' the streets , mem , in muckle toons , and they catch a haud o ' young laads , and they trail them awa ' wi ' them , and they jist torment the life oot o ' them .
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 12]: They say they 're women ; but I dinna believe that .
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 5]: It 's no possible .
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 12]: They maun be men dressed up in women 's claes . ''
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 23]: Was it a great relief to the mother 's heart to find that the childish understanding of Isie had misinterpreted and misrepresented ?
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 17]: She rose and left the room , and her troubled step went to and fro overhead .
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 9]: And the spirit of Annie was troubled likewise .
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 25]: How much she understood , I can not determine ; but I believe that a sense of vague horror and pity overwhelmed her heart .
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 20]: Yet the strength of her kindness forced her to pay some attention to the innocent little messenger of evil .
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 13]: `` Whaur heard ye a ' that , Isie , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 30]: `` I heard my father and my mither gaein ' on lamentin ' ower him efter I was i ' my bed , and they thocht I was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 33]: But gin Mistress Forbes winna tak ' him awa ' , I 'll gang and tell a ' the ministers in Glamerton , and see whether they winna raise the toon . ''
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 21]: Annie stared in amazement at the wee blue-eyed wizened creature before her speaking with the decision of a minor prophet .
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 8]: `` Is the child here still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 12]: said Mrs Forbes with some asperity as she re-entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 13]: `` I must go by the mail this afternoon , Annie . ''
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 11]: `` That 's richt , mem , '' said Isie .
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 10]: `` The suner the better , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 7]: He mayna be deid yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 8]: `` What a very odd child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 4]: said Mrs Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 13]: `` Would n't it be better to write first , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 3]: suggested Annie .
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 24]: Before Mrs Forbes could reply , the white mutch of Mrs Constable appeared over the top of the snow that walled the path .
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 15]: She was in hot pursuit of her child , whose footsteps she had traced .
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 26]: When shown into the dining-room , she rushed up to her , and caught her to her bosom , crying , `` Ye ill-contrived smatchit !
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 13]: What hae ye been aboot , rinnin ' awa ' this gait ?
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 11]: I wonner ye wasna droont i ' the Glamour . ''
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 35]: `` I do n't see what better you could expect of your own child , Mrs Constable , if you go spreading reports against other people 's children , '' said Mrs Forbes bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 15]: `` It 's a lee whaever said sae , '' retorted Mrs Constable fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 9]: `` Wha tell ' t ye that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 14]: `` Where else could your child have heard such reports , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 3]: `` Isie !
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 2]: Isie !
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 5]: My poor wee bairn !
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 17]: What hae ye been aboot to tak ' awa ' yer mither 's gude name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 8]: And she hugged the child closer yet .
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 25]: Isie hung down her head , and began to have dim perceptions that she might have been doing mischief with the best possible intentions .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 16]: `` I only tell ' t Mistress Forbes hoo ill they war to Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 17]: After a moment 's reflection , Mrs Constable turned with a subdued manner to Mrs Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 14]: `` The bairn 's a curious bairn , mem , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 23]: `` And she 's owerheard her father and me speakin ' thegither as gi n't had been only ae body thinkin ' .
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 20]: For gin ever twa was ane , that twa and that ane is Andrew Constable and mysel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 13]: `` But what right had you to talk about my son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 11]: `` Weel , mem , that queston gangs raither far .
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 26]: What 's already procleemed frae the hoose-taps may surely be spoken i ' the ear in closets - for oor back-room is but a closet .
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 25]: Gin ye think that fowk 'll haud their tongues about your bairn mair nor ony ither body 's bairn ye 're mista'en , mem .
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 36]: But never ane heard o ' ' t frae me , and I can tak ' my bodily aith for my man , for he 's jist by ordinar ' for haudin ' his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 13]: I cud hardly worm it oot o ' 'm mysel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 10]: Mrs Forbes saw that she had been too hasty .
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 11]: `` What does it all mean , Mrs Constable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 11]: she said , `` for I am quite ignorant . ''
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 9]: `` Ye may weel be that , mem .
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 33]: And maybe there 's no a word o ' trouth i ' the story , for I 'm doobtin ' the win ' that brocht it blew frae an ill airt . ''
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 11]: `` I really do n't understand you , Mrs Constable .
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 8]: What do they say about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 20]: `` Ow , jist that he 's consortin ' wi ' the warst o ' ill company , mem .
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 27]: But as I said to Anerew , maybe he 'll come oot o ' their cluiks no that muckle the waur , efter a ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 15]: Mrs Forbes sank on the sofa , and hid her face in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 11]: Annie turned white as death , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 16]: When Mrs Forbes lifted her head , Mrs Constable and her strange child had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 27]: Mrs Forbes and Annie wept together bitterly , in the shadow of death which the loved one cast upon them across the white plains and hills .
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 23]: Then the mother sat down and wrote , begging him to deny the terrible charge ; after which they both felt easier .
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 33]: But when the return of post had brought no reply , and the next day was likewise barren of tidings , Mrs Forbes resolved to go to the hateful city at once .
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 56]: When Alec woke in the morning , it rushed upon his mind that he had had a terrible dream ; and he reproached himself that even in a dream he should be capable of striking to the earth the friend who had just saved him from disgrace , and wanted to save him from more .
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 20]: But as his headache began to yield to cold water , discomposing doubts rose upon his clearing mental horizon .
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 10]: They were absurd , but still they were unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 32]: It _ could _ be only a dream that he had felled the man twice his age , and half his size , who had once shed his blood for him .
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 16]: But why did it look so like fact , if it was only a dream ?
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 3]: Horrible thought !
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 3]: Could it ?
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 13]: - It could - It must be - It was a fact !
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 55]: Haggard with horror as well as revelry , he rushed towards the stair , but was met by Mrs Leslie , who stopped him and said : `` Mr Forbes , gin you and Mr Cupples gang on at this rate , I 'll be forced to gie ye baith warnin ' to flit .
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 11]: I oucht to hae written to yer mither afore noo .
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 11]: Ye 'll brack her hert or a ' be dune .
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 23]: it 's a sair thing whan young lads tak to drink , and turn reprobates in a jiffie -LRB- moment -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 15]: `` I dinna gang to your kirk , and ye needna preach to me .
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 9]: What 's the maitter wi ' Mr Cupples ?
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 13]: He hasna ta'en to drink in a jiffie , has he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 4]: `` Ye scorner !
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 22]: He cam hame last nicht bleedin ' at the heid , and i ' the han 's o ' the watchman .
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 3]: Puir man !
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 8]: he cud hardly win up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 28]: I canna think hoo he cam ' to fa ' sae sair ; for they say there 's a special Providence watches ower drunk men and bairns .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 10]: He was an awfu ' sicht , honest man !
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 10]: A terrible mixter o ' reid and white . ''
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 8]: `` What said he about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 5]: asked Alec , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 5]: `` Ow , naething .
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 6]: He had naething till say .
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 13]: Ye maunna gang near him ; for I left him fest asleep .
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 21]: Gang awa benn to yer ain room , and I 'll be in wi ' yer brakfast in ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 21]: but ye wad be a fine lad gin ye wad only gie up the drink and the ill company . ''
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 9]: Alec obeyed , ashamed and full of remorse .
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 31]: The only thing he could do was to attend to Mr Cupples 's business in the library , where he worked at the catalogue till the afternoon lecture was over .
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 16]: Nobody had seen Beauchamp , and the blinds of Kate 's windows were drawn down .
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 40]: All day his heart was full of Mr Cupples ; and as he went home he recalled everything with perfect distinctness , and felt that his conduct had been as vile as it was possible for conduct to be .
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 36]: Because a girl could not love him , he had ceased to love his mother , had given himself up to Satan , and had returned the devotion of his friend with a murderous blow .
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 19]: Because he could not have a bed of roses , he had thrown himself down in the pig-stye .
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 13]: He rushed into a public-house , and swallowed two glasses of whisky .
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 17]: That done , he went straight home , and ran up to Mr Cupples 's room .
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 23]: Mr Cupples was sitting before the fire , with his hands on his knees and his head bound in white , bloodstained .
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 11]: He turned a ghastly face , and tried to smile .
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 7]: Alec 's heart gave way utterly .
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 25]: He knelt at Mr Cupples 's feet , laid his head on his knee , and burst into very unsaxon but most gracious tears .
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 18]: Mr Cupples laid a small trembling hand on the boy 's head , saying , `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 5]: bantam , bantam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 6]: and could say no more .
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 12]: `` Mr Cupples , '' sobbed Alec , `` forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 11]: I 'll cut my throat , gin ye like . ''
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 13]: `` Ye wad do better to cut the deevil 's throat . ''
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 7]: `` Hoo could I do that ?
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 19]: Tell me , and I 'll do ` t. '' `` Wi ' the broken whisky-bottle , man .
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 12]: That 's at the root o ' a ' the mischeef .
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 5]: It 's no you .
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 5]: It 's the drink .
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 3]: And eh !
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 11]: Alec , we micht be richt happy thegither efter that .
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 10]: I wad mak a scholar o ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 33]: `` Weel , Mr Cupples , ye hae a richt to demand o ' me what ye like ; for henceforth ye hae the pooer o ' life or deith ower me .
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 57]: But gin I try to brak throu the drinkin ' , I maun haud oot ower frae the smell o ' ` t ; an ' I doobt , '' added Alec slyly , `` ye wadna hae the chance o ' makin ' muckle o ' a scholar o ' me in that case . ''
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 17]: And now the dark roots of thought and feeling blossomed into the fair flower of resolution .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 40]: `` Bantam , '' said Mr Cupples solemnly , `` I sweir to God , gin ye 'll gie ower the drink and the lave o ' yer ill gaits , I 'll gie ower the drink as weel .
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 8]: I hae naething ither to gie ower .
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 20]: But that winna be easy , '' he added with a sigh , stretching his hand towards his glass .
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 62]: From a sudden influx of energy , Alec stretched his hand likewise towards the same glass , and laying hold on it as Mr Cupples was raising it to his lips , cried : `` I sweir to God likewise -- And noo , '' he added , leaving his hold of the glass , `` ye daurna drink it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 10]: Mr Cupples threw glass and all into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 15]: `` That 's my fareweel libation to the infernal Bacchus , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 12]: `` Lat it gang to swall the low o ' Phlegethon .
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 3]: But eh !
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 7]: it 's a terrible undertakin ' .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 14]: It 's mair nor Hercules himsel ' could hae made onything o ' .
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 2]: Bantam !
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 8]: I hae saicrifeesed mysel ' to you .
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 13]: Haud to your pairt , or I canna haud to mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 7]: It was indeed a terrible undertaking .
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 45]: I doubt whether either of them would have had courage for it , had he not been under those same exciting influences - which , undermining all power of manly action , yet give for the moment a certain amount of energy to expend .
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 21]: But the limits are narrow within which , by wasting his capital , a man secures a supply of pocket-money .
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 11]: And for them the tug of war was to come .
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 14]: They sat on opposite sides of the table and stared at each other .
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 21]: As the spirituous tide ebbed from the brain , more and more painful visions of the near future steamed up .
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 9]: Yet even already conscience began to sustain them .
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 19]: Her wine was strong , and they were so little used to it that it even excited them .
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 9]: With Alec the struggle would soon be over .
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 10]: His nervous system would speedily recover its healthy operations .
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 29]: But Cupples - from whose veins alcohol had expelled the blood , whose skull was a Circean cup of hurtful spells - would not delirium follow for him ?
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 9]: Suddenly Alec laid his hand on the bottle .
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 4]: Mr Cupples trembled .
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 9]: Was he going to break his vow already ?
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 18]: `` Wadna ' t be better to fling this into the neist yard , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 3]: said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 11]: `` We daurna fling ' t i ' the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 13]: It wad set the chimley in a low -LRB- flame -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 5]: `` Na , na .
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 11]: Lat ye ' t sit , '' returned Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 13]: `` I wad be clean affrontit gin I cudna see and forbear .
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 10]: Ye may jist pit it into the press though .
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 20]: A body needna lay burdens grievous to be borne upo ' himsel ' mair nor upo ' ither fowk .
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 20]: Noo , lat 's hae a game o ' cribbage , to haud 's ohn thocht aboot it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 7]: They played two or three games .
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 57]: It was pathetic to see how Mr Cupples 's right hand , while he looked at the cards in his left , would go blindly flitting about the spot where his glass had always used to stand ; and how , when he looked up unable to find it , his face shadowed over with disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 22]: After those two or three games , he threw down the cards , saying , `` It winna do , bantam .
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 8]: I dinna like the cairts the nicht .
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 12]: Wi'oot ony thing to weet them , they 're dooms dry .
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 11]: What say ye to a chorus o ' schylus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 13]: Alec 's habits of study had been quite broken up of late .
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 12]: Even the medical lectures and the hospital classes had been neglected .
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 18]: So schylus could not be much of a consolatory amusement in the blank which follows all exorcism .
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 30]: But Cupples felt that if no good spirit came into the empty house , sweeping and garnishing would only entice the seven to take the place of the one .
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 28]: So he tried to interest his pupil once again in his old studies ; and by frequent changes did ere long succeed in holding tedium at bay .
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 36]: But all his efforts would have resulted in nothing but that vain sweeping and garnishing , had not both their hearts been already tenanted by one good and strong spirit - essential life and humanity .
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 16]: That spirit was Love , which at the long last will expel whatsoever opposeth itself .
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 32]: While Alec felt that he must do everything to please Mr Cupples , he , on his part , felt that all the future of the youth lay in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 47]: He forgot the pangs of alcoholic desire in his fear lest Alec should not be able to endure the tedium of abstinence ; and Alec 's gratitude and remorse made him humble as a slave to the little big-hearted man whom he had injured so cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 27]: `` I 'm tired and maun gang to my bed , for I hae a sair heid , '' said Mr Cupples , that first night .
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 8]: `` That 's my doin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 5]: said Alec , sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 38]: `` Gin this new repentance o ' yours and mine turns oot to hae onything i n't , we 'll baith hae rizzon to be thankfu ' that ye cloured -LRB- dinted -RRB- my skull , Alec .
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 4]: But eh me !
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 11]: I 'm feared I winna sleep muckle the nicht . ''
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 13]: `` Wad ye like me to sit up wi ' ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 3]: asked Alec .
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 12]: `` I cud sleep i ' your cheir weel eneuch . ''
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 5]: `` Na , na .
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 17]: We hae baith need to say oor prayers , and we cudna do that weel thegither .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 19]: Gang ye awa ' to yer bed , and min ' yer vow to God and to me .
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 9]: And dinna forget yer prayers , Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 7]: Neither of them forgot his prayers .
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 10]: Alec slept soundly -- Mr Cupples not at all .
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 28]: `` I think , '' he said , when Alec appeared in the morning , `` I winna tak sic a hardship upo ' me anither nicht .
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 15]: Jist open the cat 's door and fling the bottle into somebody 's yard .
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 10]: I houp it winna cut onybody 's feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 12]: Alec flew to the cupboard , and dragged out the demon .
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 37]: `` Noo , '' said Mr Cupples , `` open the twa doors wide , and fling ' t wi ' a birr , that I may hear its last speech and dyin ' declaration . ''
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 19]: Alec did as he was desired , and the bottle fell on the stones of a little court .
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 10]: The clash rose to the ears of Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 6]: he said with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 43]: -- `` Alec , no man that hasna gane throu the same , can tell what I hae gane throu this past nicht , wi ' that deevil i ' the press there cryin ' ` Come pree -LRB- taste -RRB- me !
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 5]: come pree me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 7]: But I heard and hearkened not .
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 40]: And yet whiles i ' the nicht , although I 'm sure I didna sleep a wink , I thocht I was fumblin ' awa ' at the lock o ' the press an ' cudna get it opened .
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 35]: And the press was a coffin set up upo ' its en ' , an ' I kent that there was a corp inside it , and yet I tried sair to ope n't .
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 36]: An ' syne again , I thocht it was the gate o ' Paradees afore which stud the angel wi ' the flamin ' sword that turned ilka gait , and wadna lat me in .
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 29]: But I 'm some better sin the licht cam , and I wad fain hae a drappy o ' that fine caller tipple they ca ' watter . ''
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 33]: Alec ran down and brought it cold from the pump , saying , as Mr Cupples returned the tumbler with a look of thanks , `` But there 's the tappit hen .
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 21]: I doot gin we lea ' her i ' the press , she 'll be wantin ' to lay . ''
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 11]: `` Na , na , nae fear o ' that .
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 8]: She 's as toom 's a cock .
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 4]: Gang and luik .
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 16]: The last drap in her wame flaw oot at the window i ' that bottle .
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 18]: Alec , but I 'll hae a sair day , and ye maun be true to me .
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 14]: Gie me my Homer , or I 'll never win throu ` t .
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 29]: An ye may lay John Milton within my rax -LRB- reach -RRB- ; for I winna pit my leg oot o ' the blankets till ye come hame .
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 11]: Sae ye maunna be langer nor ye can help . ''
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 11]: Alec promised , and set off with a light heart .
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 8]: Beauchamp was at none of the classes .
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 12]: And the blinds of Kate 's windows were still drawn down .
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 22]: For a whole week he came home as early as possible and spent the rest of the day with Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 9]: But many dreary hours passed over them both .
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 40]: The suffering of Mr Cupples and the struggle which he had to sustain with the constant craving of his whole being , are perhaps indescribable ; but true to his vow and to his friend , he endured manfully .
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 29]: Still it was with a rueful-comical look and a sigh , sometimes , that he would sit down to his tea , remarking , `` Eh , man !
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 18]: this is meeserable stuff - awfu ' weyk tipple - a pagan invention a ` thegither . ''
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 43]: But the tea comforted the poor half-scorched , half-sodden nerves notwithstanding , and by slow degrees they began to gather tone and strength ; his appetite improved ; and at the end of the week he resumed his duties in the library .
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 49]: And thenceforth , as soon as his classes were over , Alec would go to the library to Mr Cupples , or on other days Mr Cupples would linger near the medical school or hospital , till Alec came out , and then they would go home together .
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 22]: Once home , both found enough to do in getting one of them up to the mark of the approaching examinations .
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 38]: -- Two pale-faced creatures they sat there , in Mr Cupples 's garret , looking wretched and subdued enough , although occasionally they broke out laughing , as the sparks of life revived and flickered into merriment .
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 12]: Inquiring after Miss Fraser , Alec learned that she was ill .
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 13]: The maid inquired in return if he knew anything about Mr Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXVII .
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 41]: Mr Cupples and Alec were hard at work - the table covered with books and papers ; when a knock came to the door - the rarest occurrence in that skyey region - and the landlady ushered in Mrs Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 16]: The two men sprang to their feet , and Mrs Forbes stared with gratified amazement .
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 20]: The place was crowded with signs of intellectual labour , and not even a pack of cards was visible .
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 13]: `` Why did n't you answer my last letter , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 14]: It had dropped behind some books , and he had never seen it .
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 15]: `` What is the meaning , then , of such reports about you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 22]: she resumed , venturing to put the question in the presence of Mr Cupples in the hope of a corroborated refutation .
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 11]: Alec looked confused , grew red , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 7]: Mr Cupples took up the reply .
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 41]: `` Ye see , mem , it 's a pairt o ' the edication o ' the human individual , frae the time o ' Adam and Eve doonwith , to learn to refuse the evil and chowse the guid .
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 25]: This doesna aye come o ' eatin ' butter and honey , but whiles o ' eatin ' aise -LRB- ashes -RRB- and dirt .
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 21]: Noo , my pupil , here , mem , your son , has eaten that dirt and made that chice .
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 23]: And I 'll be caution -LRB- security -RRB- for him that he 'll never mair return to wallow i ' that mire .
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 19]: It 's three weeks , mem , sin ae drop o ' whusky has passed his mou . ''
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 4]: `` Whisky ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 4]: exclaimed the mother .
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 3]: `` Alec !
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 5]: Is it possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 5]: `` Mem , mem !
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 43]: It wad become ye better to fa ' doon upo ' yer knees and thank the God that 's brocht him oot o ' a fearfu ' pit and oot o ' the miry clay and set his feet upon a rock .
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 26]: But the rock 's some sma ' i ' the fit-haud , and ae word micht jist caw him aff o ' ' t again .
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 22]: Gin ye fa ' to upbraidin ' o ' 'm , ye may gar him clean forget 's washin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 17]: But Mrs Forbes was proud , and did not like interference between her and her son .
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 17]: Had she found things as bad as she had expected , she would have been humble .
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 13]: Now that her fears had abated , her natural pride had returned .
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 14]: `` Take me to your own room , Alec , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 7]: `` Ay , ay , mem .
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 7]: Tak ' him wi ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 23]: But caw cannie , ye ken , or ye 'll gie me a deevil o ' a job wi ' 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 11]: With a smile to Cupples , Alec led the way .
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 14]: He would have told his mother almost everything if she had been genial .
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 42]: As she was , he contented himself with a general confession that he had been behaving very badly , and would have grown ten times worse but for Mr Cupples , who was the best friend that he had on earth .
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 9]: `` Better than your mother , Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 5]: she asked , jealously .
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 20]: `` I was no kith or kin of his , and yet he loved me , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 14]: `` He ought to have behaved more like a gentleman to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 10]: `` Mother , you do n't understand Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 6]: He 's a strange creature .
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 30]: He takes a pride in speaking the broadest Scotch , when he could talk to you in more languages than you ever heard of , if he liked . ''
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 13]: `` I do n't think he 's fit company for you anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 11]: We 'll change the subject , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 19]: So Alec was yet more annoyed , and the intercourse between mother and son was forced and uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 14]: As soon as she retired to rest , Alec bounded up stairs again .
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 10]: `` Never mind my mother , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 22]: `` She 's a good woman , but she 's vexed with me , and lets it out on you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 5]: `` Mind her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 22]: answered Mr Cupples ; `` she 's a verra fine woman ; and she may say what she likes to me .
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 12]: She 'll be a ' richt the morn 's mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 24]: A woman wi ' ae son 's like a coo wi ' ae horn , some kittle -LRB- ticklish -RRB- , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 12]: I cud see in her een haill coal-pits o ' affection .
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 18]: She wad dee for ye , afore ye cud say - ` Dinna , mither . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 10]: Next day they went to call on Professor Fraser .
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 16]: He received them kindly , and thanked Mrs Forbes for her attentions to his niece .
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 7]: But he seemed oppressed and troubled .
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 25]: His niece was far from well , he said - had not left her room for some weeks , and could see no one .
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 18]: Mrs Forbes associated Alec 's conduct with Kate 's illness , but said nothing about her suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 18]: After one day more , she returned home , reassured by but not satisfied with her visit .
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 31]: She felt that Alec had outgrown his former relation to her , and had a dim perception that her pride had prevented them from entering upon a yet closer relation .
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 17]: It is their own fault when mothers lose by the _ growth _ of their children .
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 10]: Meantime , Annie was passing through a strange experience .
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 20]: It gave her a dreadful shock to know that such things were reported of her hero , her champion .
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 12]: They could not be true , else Chaos was come again .
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 46]: But when no exultant denial of them arrived from the pen of his mother , although she wrote as she had promised , then she understood by degrees that the youth had erred from the path , and had denied the Lord that bought him .
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 32]: She brooded and fancied and recoiled till the thought of him became so painful that she turned from it , rather than from him , with discomfort amounting almost to disgust .
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 15]: He had been to her the centre of all that was noble and true .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 18]: And he revelled in company of which she knew nothing except from far-off hints of unapproachable pollution !
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 27]: Her idol all of silver hue was blackened with the breath of sulphur , and the world was overspread with the darkness which radiated from it .
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 15]: In this mood she went to the week-evening service at Mr Turnbull 's chapel .
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 20]: There she sat listless , looking for no help , and caring for none of the hymns or prayers .
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 14]: At length Mr Turnbull began to read the story of the Prodigal Son .
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 13]: And during the reading her distress vanished like snow in the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 32]: For she took for her own the character of the elder brother , prayed for forgiveness , and came away loving Alec Forbes more than ever she had loved him before .
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 19]: If God could love the Prodigal , might she not , ought she not to love him too ?
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 27]: - The deepest source of her misery , though she did not know that it was , had been the fading of her love to him .
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 16]: And as she walked home through the dark , the story grew into other comfort .
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 11]: A prodigal might see the face of God , then !
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 11]: He was no grand monarch , but a homely father .
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 15]: He would receive her one day , and let her look in his face .
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 8]: Nor did the trouble return any more .
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 17]: From that one moment , no feeling of repugnance ever mingled with her thought of Alec .
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 14]: For such a one as he could not help repenting , she said .
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 13]: He would be sure to rise and go back to his Father .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 139]: She would not have found it hard to believe even , that , come early , or linger late , no swine-keeping son of the Father will be able to help repenting at last ; that no God-born soul will be able to go on trying to satisfy himself with the husks that the swine eat , or to refrain from thinking of his Father 's house , and wishing himself within its walls even in the meanest place ; or that such a wish is prelude to the best robe and the ring and the fatted calf , when the Father would spend himself in joyous obliteration of his son 's past and its misery - having got him back his very own , and better than when he went , because more humble and more loving .
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 72]: When Mrs Forbes came home , she entered into no detail , and was disinclined to talk about the matter at all , probably as much from dissatisfaction with herself as with her son , But Annie 's heart blossomed into a quiet delight when she learned that the facts were not so bad as the reports , and that there was no doubt he would yet live them all down .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 26]: The evil time was drawing nigh , ushered by gentler gales and snowdrops , when she must be turned out for the spring and summer .
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 33]: She would feel it more than ever , but less than if her aunt had not explained to her that she had a right to the shelter afforded her by the Bruces .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 8]: Meantime arrived a letter from Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 65]: `` Dear Madam , - After all the efforts of Mr Alec , aided by my best endeavours , but counteracted by the grief of knowing that his cousin , Miss Fraser , entertained a devoted regard for a worthless class-fellow of his - after all our united efforts , Mr Alec has not been able to pass more than two of his examinations .
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 26]: I am certain he would have done better but for the unhappiness to which I have referred , combined with the illness of Miss Fraser .
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 52]: In the course of a day or two , he will return to you , when , if you can succeed , as none but mothers can , in restoring him to some composure of mind , he will be perfectly able during the vacation to make up for lost time .
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 16]: `` I am , dear madam , your obedient servant , `` Cosmo Cupples . ''
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 55]: Angry with Kate , annoyed with her son , vexed with herself , and indignant at the mediation of `` that dirty vulgar little man , '' Mrs Forbes forgot her usual restraint , and throwing the letter across the table with the words `` Bad news , Annie , '' left the room .
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 16]: But the effect produced upon Annie by the contents of the letter was very different .
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 13]: Hitherto she had looked up to Alec as a great strong creature .
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 10]: Her faith in him had been unquestioning and unbounded .
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 14]: Even his wrong-doings had not impressed her with any sense of his weakness .
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 42]: But now , rejected and disgraced , his mother dissatisfied , his friend disappointed , and himself foiled in the battle of life , he had fallen upon evil days , and all the woman in Annie rose for his defence .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 15]: In a moment they had changed places in the world of her moral imagination .
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 27]: The strong youth was weak and defenceless : the gentle girl opened the heart almost of motherhood , to receive and shelter the worn outraged man .
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 12]: A new tenderness , a new pity took possession of her .
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 46]: Indignant with Kate , angry with the professors , ready to kiss the hands of Mr Cupples , all the tenderness of her tender nature gathered about her fallen hero , and she was more like his wife defending him from _ her _ mother .
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 13]: Now she could be something if not to him yet for him .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 37]: He had been a `` bright particular star '' `` beyond her sphere , '' but now the star lay in the grass , shorn of its beams , and she took it to her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 4]: Two days passed .
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 21]: On the third evening in walked Alec , pale and trembling , evidently ill , too ill to be questioned .
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 9]: His breathing was short and checked by pain .
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 24]: `` If I had n't come at once , mother , '' he said , `` I should have been laid up there .
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 9]: It 's pleurisy , Mr Cupples says . ''
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 6]: `` My poor boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 6]: I do n't care . ''
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 11]: `` You 've been working too hard , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 4]: Alec laughed bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 13]: `` I did work , mother ; but it does n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 5]: She 's dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 6]: `` Who 's dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 4]: exclaimed his mother .
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 5]: `` Kate 's dead .
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 7]: And I could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 4]: I tried hard .
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 8]: And it 's all my fault too .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 7]: Cupples says she 's better dead .
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 8]: But I might have saved her . ''
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 24]: He started from the sofa , and went pacing about the room , his face flushed and his breath coming faster and shorter .
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 15]: His mother got him to lie down again , and asked no more questions .
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 16]: The doctor came and bled him at the arm , and sent him to bed .
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 21]: When Annie saw him worn and ill , her heart swelled till she could hardly bear the aching of it .
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 13]: She would have been his slave , and she could do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 6]: She must leave him instead .
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 26]: She went to her room , put on her bonnet and cloak , and was leaving the house when Mrs Forbes caught sight of her .
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 3]: `` Annie !
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 9]: what _ do _ you mean , child ?
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 9]: You 're not going to leave me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 14]: `` I thought you would n't want me any more , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 6]: `` You silly child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 19]: Annie ran back to her room , thus compromising with a strong inclination to dance back to it .
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 24]: When Mr Cupples and Alec had begun to place confidence in each other 's self-denial , they cared less to dog each other .
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 47]: - Alec finding at the Natural Philosophy examination that he had no chance , gathered his papers , and leaving the room , wandered away to his former refuge when miserable , that long desolate stretch of barren sand between the mouths of the two rivers .
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 13]: Here he wandered till long after the dusk had deepened into night .
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 18]: - A sound as of one singing came across the links , and drew nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 31]: He turned in the direction of it , for something in the tones reminded him of Kate ; and he almost believed the song was her nurse 's ghostly ballad .
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 18]: But it ceased ; and after walking some distance inland , he turned again towards the sea .
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 14]: The song rose once more , but now between him and the sea .
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 12]: He ran towards it , falling repeatedly on the broken ground .
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 35]: By the time he reached the shore , the singing had again ceased , but presently a wild cry came from seawards , where the waves far out were still ebbing from the shore .
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 25]: He dashed along the glimmering sands , thinking he caught glimpses of something white , but there was no moon to give any certainty .
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 13]: As he advanced he became surer , but the sea was between .
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 4]: He rushed in .
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 7]: Deeper and deeper grew the water .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 3]: He swam .
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 38]: But before he could reach the spot , for he had taken to the water too soon , with another cry the figure vanished , probably in one of those deep pits which abound along that shore .
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 13]: Still he held on , diving many times , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 44]: His vigour was not now what it had once been , and at length he was so exhausted , that when he came to himself , lying on his back in the dry sands , he had quite forgotten how he came there .
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 17]: He would have rushed again into the water , but he could scarcely move his limbs .
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 14]: He actually crawled part of the way across the links to the college .
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 11]: There he inquired if Miss Fraser was in the house .
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 17]: The maid assured him that she was in her own room , whereupon he went home .
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 21]: But he had scarcely gone before they discovered that her room was deserted , and she nowhere to be found .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 19]: The shock of this news rendered it impossible for him to throw off the effects of his exposure .
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 13]: But he lingered on till Mr Cupples compelled him to go home .
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 12]: Not even then , however , had her body been recovered .
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 36]: Alec was convinced that she had got into one of the quicksands ; but it was cast ashore a few days after his departure , and it was well that he did not see it .
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 11]: He did not learn the fact till many years after .
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 15]: It soon transpired that she had been out of her mind for some time .
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 10]: Indeed rumours of the sort had been afloat before .
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 11]: The proximate cause of her insanity was not certainly known .
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 28]: Some suspicion of the worthlessness of her lover , some enlightenment as to his perfidy , or his unaccountable disappearance alone , may have occasioned its manifestation .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 16]: But there is great reason to believe that she had a natural predisposition to it .
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 49]: And having never been taught to provide for her own mental sustenance , and so nourish a necessary independence , she had been too ready to squander the wealth of a rich and lovely nature upon an unworthy person , and the reaction had been madness and death .
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 8]: But anything was better than marrying Beauchamp .
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 38]: One strange fact in the case was her inexplicable aversion to water - either a crude prevision of her coming fate , or , in the mysterious operations of delirious reasoning , the actual cause of it .
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 27]: The sea , visible from her window over the dreary flat of the links , may have fascinated her , and drawn her to her death .
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 6]: Such cases are not unknown .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 24]: During the worst period of Alec 's illness , he was ever wandering along that shore , or swimming in those deadly waters .
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 18]: Sometimes he had laid hold of the drowning girl and was struggling with her to the surface .
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 39]: Sometimes he was drawing her in an agony from the swallowing gullet of a quicksand , which held her fast , and swallowed at her all the time that he fought to rescue her from its jawless throat .
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 30]: Annie took her turn in the sick chamber , watching beside the half-unconscious lad , and listening anxiously to the murmurs that broke through the veil of his dreams .
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 47]: The feeling with which she had received the prodigal home into her heart , spread its roots deeper and wider , and bore at length a flower of a pale-rosy flush - Annie 's love revealed to herself - strong although pale , delicate although strong .
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 20]: It seemed to the girl she had loved him so always , only she had not thought about it .
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 46]: He had fought for her and endured for her at school ; he had saved her life from the greedy waters of the Glamour at the risk of his own : she would be the most ungrateful of girls if she did not love him .
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 15]: - And she did love him with a quiet intensity peculiar to her nature .
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 23]: Never had she happier hours than those in which it seemed that only the stars and the angels were awake besides herself .
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 31]: And if while watching him thus at night she grew sleepy , she would kneel down and pray God to keep her awake , lest any harm should befall Alec .
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 30]: Then she would wonder if even the angels could do without sleep always , and fancy them lying about the warm fields of heaven between their own shadowy wings .
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 53]: She would wonder next if it would be safe for God to close his eyes for one minute - safe for the world , she meant ; and hope that , if ever he did close his eyes , that might not be the one moment when she should see his face .
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 26]: Then she would nod , and wake up with a start , flutter silently to her feet , and go and peep at the slumberer .
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 16]: Never was woman happier than Annie was during those blessed midnights and cold grey dawns .
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 44]: Sometimes , in those terrible hours after midnight that belong neither to the night nor the day , but almost to the primeval darkness , the terrors of the darkness would seize upon her , and she would sit `` inhabiting trembling . ''
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 25]: But the lightest movement of the sleeper would rouse her , and a glance at the place where he lay would dispel her fears .
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXIX .
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 51]: One night she heard a rustling amongst the bushes in the garden ; and the next moment a subdued voice began to sing : I waited for the Lord my God and patiently did bear ; At length to me he did incline , my voice and cry to hear .
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 27]: He took me from a fearful pit , and from the miry clay , And on a rock he set my feet , establishing my way .
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 14]: The tune was that wildest of trustful wailings - _ Martyrs _ ' .
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 17]: `` I didna ken that ye cared aboot psalm-tunes , Mr Cupples , '' murmured Alec .
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 9]: The singing went on and he grew restless .
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 18]: It was an _ eerie _ thing to go out , but she must stop the singing .
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 13]: If it was Mr Cupples , she could have nothing to fear .
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 11]: Besides , a bad man would not sing that song .
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 37]: - As she opened the door , a soft spring wind blew upon her full of genial strength , as if it came straight from those dark blue clefts between the heavy clouds of the cast .
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 15]: Away in the clear west , the half-moon was going down in dreaming stillness .
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 16]: The dark figure of a little man stood leaning against the house , singing gently .
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 7]: `` Are you Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 13]: The man started , and answered , `` Yes , my lass .
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 6]: And wha are ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 6]: `` I 'm Annie Anderson .
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 10]: Alec 's some disturbit wi ' your singin ' .
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 26]: Ye 'll wauk him up , and he 'll be a hantle the waur o ' ` t. '' `` I winna sing anither stave .
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 25]: It was lanesome stan ` in ' upo ' the ootside here , as gin I war ane o ' the foolish virgins . ''
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 7]: wadna that be dreidfu ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 4]: responded Annie simply .
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 17]: Her words awoke an echo in Mr Cupples 's conscience , but he returned no reply .
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 6]: `` Hoo 's Alec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 4]: `` Some better .
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 13]: He 's growin ' better , though it 's langsome like . ''
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 14]: `` And do they lippen you to luik efter him , no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 3]: `` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 4]: What for no ?
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 14]: His mither wad be worn to deith gin she sat up ilka nicht .
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 10]: He canna bide ouybody but her or me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 14]: `` Weel , ye 're a young crater to hae sic a chairge .
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 19]: - I wrote to Mrs Forbes twa or three times , but I got but ae scrimpit answer .
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 21]: Sae as sune 's I cud win awa ' , I cam ' to speir efter him mysel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 10]: `` Whan did ye come , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 4]: `` This nicht .
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 9]: Or I reckon it 's last nicht noo .
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 24]: But or I wan ower this le n'th , ye war a ' i ' yer beds , and I daurna disturb ye .
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 27]: Sae I sat doon in a summer-seat that I cam ' upo ' , and smokit my pipe and luikit at the stars and the cluds .
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 36]: And I tried to sing a sang , but naething but psalms wad come , for the nicht 's sae awfu ' solemn , whan ye win richt intil the mids o ' ` t !
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 23]: It jist distresses me that there 's naebody up to worship God a ' nicht in sic a nicht 's this . ''
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 15]: `` Nae doobt there 's mony praisin ' him that we canna see . ''
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 8]: `` Ow , ay ; nae doobt .
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 19]: But aneath this lift , and breathin ' the houpfu ' air o ' this divine darkness . ''
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 7]: Annie did not quite understand him .
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 12]: `` I maun gang back to Alec , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 19]: `` Ye 'll come ower the morn , Mr Cupples , and hear a ' aboot him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 9]: `` I will do that , my bairn .
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 15]: Hoo do they ca ' ye - for I forget names dreidfu ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 5]: `` Annie Anderson . ''
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 16]: `` Ay , ay ; Annie Anderson - I hae surely heard that name afore .
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 19]: - Weel , I winna forget _ you _ , whether I forget yer name or no . ''
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 8]: `` But hae ye a bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 21]: said the thoughtful girl , to whom the comfort of every one who came near her was an instinctive anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 5]: `` Ow , ay .
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 27]: I hae a bed at the hoose o ' a sma ' , jabberin ' , bitter-barkit crater they ca ' King Robert the Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 44]: Annie knew that he must be occupying her room ; and was on the point of expressing a hope that he `` wadna be disturbit wi ' the rottans , '' when she saw that it would lead to new explanations and delays .
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 16]: `` Good night , Mr Cupples , '' she said , holding out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 36]: Mr Cupples took it kindly , saying : `` Are ye a niece , or a gran ' - dochter o ' the hoose , or a hired servan ' , or what are ye ?
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 12]: - for ye 're a wice-spoken lass and a bonnie . ''
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 15]: `` I 'm a servan ' o ' the hoose , '' said Annie .
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 18]: Then after a moment 's hesitation , she added , `` but no a hired ane . ''
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 29]: `` Ye 're worth hirin ' onyhoo , hinnie -LRB- honey -RRB- ; and they 're weel aff that has ye i ' the hoose in ony capawcity .
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 12]: An auld man like me may say that to yer face .
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 22]: Sae I 'll awa ' to my bed , and sing the lave o ' my psalm as I gang . ''
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 8]: Mr Cupples had a proclivity to garrets .
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 13]: He could not be comfortable if any person was over his head .
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 15]: He could breathe , he said , when he got next to the stars .
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 19]: For the rats he cared nothing , and slept as if the garret were a cellar in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 9149 len. 27]: It had been a sore trial of his manhood to keep his vow after he knew that Alec was safe in the haven of a sick-bed .
Parsing [sent. 9150 len. 39]: He knew that for him , if he were once happy again , there was little danger of a relapse ; for his physical nature had not been greatly corrupted : there had not been time for that .
Parsing [sent. 9151 len. 8]: He would rise from his sickness newborn .
Parsing [sent. 9152 len. 21]: Hence it was the harder for Mr Cupples , in his loneliness , to do battle with his deep-rooted desires .
Parsing [sent. 9153 len. 18]: He would never drink as he had done , but might he not have just one tumbler ?
Parsing [sent. 9154 len. 9]: - That one tumbler he did not take .
Parsing [sent. 9155 len. 5]: And -- rich reward !
Parsing [sent. 9156 len. 48]: - after two months the well of song within him began to gurgle and heave as if its waters would break forth once more in the desert ; the roseate hue returned to the sunsets ; and the spring came in with a very childhood of greenness .
Parsing [sent. 9157 len. 20]: - The obfuscations of self-indulgence will soon vanish where they have not been sealed by crime and systematic selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 9158 len. 25]: Another though inferior reward was , that he had money in his pocket : with this money he would go and see Alec Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 9159 len. 14]: The amount being small , however , he would save it by walking .
Parsing [sent. 9160 len. 10]: Hence it came that he arrived late and weary .
Parsing [sent. 9161 len. 15]: Entering the first shop he came to , he inquired after a cheap lodging .
Parsing [sent. 9162 len. 40]: For he said to himself that the humblest inn was beyond his means ; though probably his reason for avoiding such a shelter was the same as made him ask Alec to throw the bottle out of the garret .
Parsing [sent. 9163 len. 45]: Robert Bruce heard his question , and , regarding him keenly from under his eyebrows , debated with himself whether the applicant was respectable - that is , whether he could pay , and would bring upon the house no discredit by the harbourage .
Parsing [sent. 9164 len. 19]: The signs of such a man as Cupples were inscrutable to Bruce ; therefore his answer hung fire .
Parsing [sent. 9165 len. 8]: `` Are ye deif , man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9166 len. 24]: said Cupples ; `` or are ye feared to tyne a chance by giein ' a fair answer to a fair queston ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9167 len. 12]: The arrow went too near the mark not to irritate Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 9168 len. 10]: `` Gang yer wa 's , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 9169 len. 11]: `` We dinna want tramps i ' this toon . ''
Parsing [sent. 9170 len. 53]: `` Weel , I am a tramp , nae doobt , '' returned Cupples ; `` for I hae come ilka bit o ' the road upo ' my ain fit ; but I hae read in history o ' twa or three tramps that war respectable fowk for a ' that .
Parsing [sent. 9171 len. 18]: Ye winna _ gie _ onything i ' this chop , I doobt - nae even information .
Parsing [sent. 9172 len. 14]: - Will ye _ sell _ me an unce o ' pigtail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9173 len. 5]: `` Ow , ay .
Parsing [sent. 9174 len. 30]: I 'll sell ' t gin ye 'll buy ` t. '' `` There 's the bawbees , '' said Cupples , laying the orthodox pence on the counter .
Parsing [sent. 9175 len. 21]: `` And noo will ye tell me whaur I can get a respectable , dacent place to lie doon in ?
Parsing [sent. 9176 len. 13]: I 'll want it for a week , at ony rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 9177 len. 21]: Before he had finished the question , the door behind the counter had opened , and young Bruce had entered .
Parsing [sent. 9178 len. 15]: Mr Cupples knew him well enough by sight as a last year 's bejan .
Parsing [sent. 9179 len. 6]: `` How are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9180 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 9181 len. 14]: `` I know you , though I do n't know your name . ''
Parsing [sent. 9182 len. 11]: `` My name 's Robert Bruce , Mr Cupples . ''
Parsing [sent. 9183 len. 12]: `` A fine name - Robert Bruce , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 9184 len. 23]: The youth turned to his father , and said - `` This gentleman is the librarian of our college , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 9185 len. 15]: Bruce took his hat off his head , and set it on the counter .
Parsing [sent. 9186 len. 12]: `` I beg your pardon , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 9187 len. 11]: `` I 'm terrible short-sichtit in can ` le-licht . ''
Parsing [sent. 9188 len. 25]: `` I 'm used to bein ' mista'en ' , '' answered Cupples simply , perceiving that he had got hold of a character .
Parsing [sent. 9189 len. 15]: `` Mak nae apologies , I beg ye , but answer my queston . ''
Parsing [sent. 9190 len. 23]: `` Weel , sir , to tell the trowth , seein ' ye 're a gentleman , we hae a room oorsels .
Parsing [sent. 9191 len. 67]: But it 's a garret-room , and maybe - '' `` Then I 'll hae ` t , whatever it be , gin ye dinna want ower muckle for ` t. '' `` Weel , ye see , sir , your college is a great expense to heumble fowk like oorsels , and we hae to mak it up the best way that we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 9192 len. 4]: `` Nae doot .
Parsing [sent. 9193 len. 7]: Hoo muckle do ye want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9194 len. 11]: `` Wad ye think five shillins ower muckle ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 9195 len. 22]: ` Deed wad I. '' `` Weel , we 'll say three than - to _ you _ , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 9196 len. 10]: `` I winna gie ye mair nor half-a-croon . ''
Parsing [sent. 9197 len. 5]: `` Hoot , sir !
Parsing [sent. 9198 len. 6]: It 's ower little . ''
Parsing [sent. 9199 len. 23]: `` Well , I 'll look further , '' said Mr Cupples , putting on English , and moving to the door .
Parsing [sent. 9200 len. 12]: `` Na , sir ; ye 'll do nae sic thing .
Parsing [sent. 9201 len. 34]: Do ye think I wad lat the leebrarian o ' my son 's college gang oot at my door this time o ' nicht , to luik for a bed till himsel ' ?
Parsing [sent. 9202 len. 15]: Ye s ' jist hae ' t at yer ain price , and welcome .
Parsing [sent. 9203 len. 19]: Ye 'll hae yer tay and sugar and bitties o ' cheese frae me , ye ken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9204 len. 7]: `` Of course - of course .
Parsing [sent. 9205 len. 19]: And if you could get me some tea at once , I should be obliged to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9206 len. 22]: `` Mother , '' cried Bruce through the house-door , and held a momentary whispering with the partner of his throne .
Parsing [sent. 9207 len. 11]: `` So your name 's Bruce , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9208 len. 11]: resumed Cupples , as the other returned to the counter .
Parsing [sent. 9209 len. 11]: `` Robert Bruce , sir , at your service . ''
Parsing [sent. 9210 len. 17]: `` It 's a gran ' _ name _ , '' said Cupples with emphasis . ''
Parsing [sent. 9211 len. 35]: ` Deed is ` t , and I hae a richt to beir ` t. '' `` Ye 'll be a descendant , nae doot , o ' the Yerl o ' Carrick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9212 len. 8]: said Cupples , guessing at his weakness .
Parsing [sent. 9213 len. 8]: `` O ' the king , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9214 len. 18]: Fowk may think little o ' me ; but I come o ' him that freed Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 9215 len. 18]: Gin it hadna been for Bannockburn , sir , whaur wad Scotland hae been the day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9216 len. 35]: `` Nearhan ' civileezed unner the fine influences o ' the English , wi ' their cultivation and their mainners , and , aboon a ' , their gran ' Edwards and Hairries . ''
Parsing [sent. 9217 len. 14]: `` I dinna richtly unnerstan ' ye , sir , '' said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 9218 len. 23]: `` Ye hae heard hoo the king clave the skull o ' Sir Henry dee Bohunn - haena ye , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9219 len. 5]: `` Ow , aye .
Parsing [sent. 9220 len. 11]: But it was a pity it wasna the ither gait .
Parsing [sent. 9221 len. 20]: Lat me see the way to my room , for I want to wash my han 's and face .
Parsing [sent. 9222 len. 12]: They 're jist barkit wi ' stour -LRB- dust -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 9223 len. 11]: Bruce hesitated whether to show Mr Cupples out or in .
Parsing [sent. 9224 len. 12]: His blue blood boiled at this insult to his great progenitor .
Parsing [sent. 9225 len. 16]: But a half-crown would cover a greater wrong than that even , and he obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 9226 len. 17]: Cupples followed him up-stairs , murmuring to himself : `` Shades o ' Wallace and Bruce !
Parsing [sent. 9227 len. 3]: forgie me .
Parsing [sent. 9228 len. 83]: But to see sma ' craters cock their noses and their tails as gin they had inherited the michty deeds as weel as the names o ' their forbears , jist scunners me , and turns my blude into the gall o ' bitterness - and that 's scripter for ` t. '' After further consultation , Mr and Mrs Bruce came to the conclusion that it might be politic , for Robert 's sake , to treat the librarian with consideration .
Parsing [sent. 9229 len. 17]: Consequently Mrs Bruce invited him to go down to his tea in _ the room _ .
Parsing [sent. 9230 len. 12]: Descending before it was quite ready , he looked about him .
Parsing [sent. 9231 len. 13]: The only thing that attracted his attention was a handsomely bound Bible .
Parsing [sent. 9232 len. 73]: This he took up , thinking to get some amusement from the births of the illustrious Bruces ; but the only inscription he could find , besides the name of _ John Cowie _ , was the following in pencil : '' _ Super Davidis Psalmum tertium vicesimum , syngrapham pecuniariam centum solidos valentem , qu , me mortuo , a Annie Anderson , mihi dilecta , sit , posui _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 9233 len. 18]: Then came some figures , and then the date , with the initials _ J. C _ .
Parsing [sent. 9234 len. 17]: Hence it was that Mr Cupples thought he had heard the name of Annie Anderson before .
Parsing [sent. 9235 len. 19]: `` It 's a gran ' Bible this , gudewife , '' he said as Mrs Bruce entered .
Parsing [sent. 9236 len. 6]: `` Aye is ` t .
Parsing [sent. 9237 len. 7]: It belanged to oor pairis-minister . ''
Parsing [sent. 9238 len. 10]: Nothing more passed , for Mr Cupples was hungry .
Parsing [sent. 9239 len. 36]: After a long sleep in the morning , he called upon Mrs Forbes , and was kindly received ; but it was a great disappointment to him to find that he could not see Alec .
Parsing [sent. 9240 len. 25]: As he was in the country , however , he resolved to make the best of it , and enjoy himself for a week .
Parsing [sent. 9241 len. 21]: For his asserted dislike to the country , though genuine at the time , was anything but natural to him .
Parsing [sent. 9242 len. 30]: So every day he climbed to the top of one or other of the hills which inclosed the valley , and was rewarded with fresh vigour and renewed joy .
Parsing [sent. 9243 len. 28]: He had not learned to read Wordsworth ; yet not a wind blew through a broom-bush , but it blew a joy from it into his heart .
Parsing [sent. 9244 len. 19]: He too was a prodigal returned at least into _ the vestibule _ of his Father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 9245 len. 47]: And the Father sent the servants out there to minister to him ; and Nature , the housekeeper , put the robe of health upon him , and gave him new shoes of strength , and a ring , though not the Father 's white stone .
Parsing [sent. 9246 len. 19]: The delights of those spring days were endless to him whose own nature was budding with new life .
Parsing [sent. 9247 len. 59]: Familiar with all the cottage ways , he would drop into any _ hoosie _ he came near about his dinnertime , and asking for a _ piece _ -LRB- of oat-cake -RRB- and a _ coguie o ' milk _ , would make his dinner off those content , and leave a trifle behind him in acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 9248 len. 27]: But he would always contrive that as the gloamin began to fall , he should be near Howglen , that he might inquire after his friend .
Parsing [sent. 9249 len. 9]: And Mrs Forbes began to understand him better .
Parsing [sent. 9250 len. 52]: - Before the week was over , there was not a man or woman about Howglen whom he did not know even by name ; for to his surprise , even his forgetfulness was fast vanishing in the menstruum of the earth-spirit , the world 's breath blown over the corn .
Parsing [sent. 9251 len. 20]: In particular he had made the acquaintance of James Dow , with whose knowing simplicity he was greatly taken .
Parsing [sent. 9252 len. 34]: On the last day but one of his intended stay , as he went to make his daily inquiry , he dropped in to see James Dow in the `` harled hypocrite . ''
Parsing [sent. 9253 len. 27]: James had come in from his work , and was sitting alone on a bench by the table , in a corner of the earth-floored kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 9254 len. 28]: The great pot , lidless , and full of magnificent potatoes , was hanging above the fire , that its contents might be quite dry for supper .
Parsing [sent. 9255 len. 58]: Through the little window , a foot and a half square , Cupples could see the remains of a hawthorn hedge , a hundred years old - a hedge no longer , but a row of knobby , gnarled trees , full of knees and elbows ; and through the trees the remains of an orange-coloured sunset .
Parsing [sent. 9256 len. 51]: - It was not a beautiful country , as I have said before ; but the spring was beautiful , and the heavens were always beautiful ; and , like the plainest woman 's face , the country itself , in its best moods , had no end of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 9257 len. 9]: `` Hoo are ye , Jeames Doo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9258 len. 14]: `` Fine , I thank ye , sir , '' said James rising .
Parsing [sent. 9259 len. 24]: `` I wad raither sit doon mysel ' , nor gar you stan ' up efter yer day 's work , Jeames . ''
Parsing [sent. 9260 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 9261 len. 13]: I dinna warstle mysel ' to the deith a ` thegither . ''
Parsing [sent. 9262 len. 29]: But James , who was not a healthy man , was often in the wet field when another would have been in bed , and righteously in bed .
Parsing [sent. 9263 len. 36]: He had a strong feeling of the worthlessness of man 's life in comparison with the work he has to do , even if that work be only the spreading of a fother of dung .
Parsing [sent. 9264 len. 10]: His mistress could not keep him from his work .
Parsing [sent. 9265 len. 11]: Mr Cupples sat down , and James resumed his seat .
Parsing [sent. 9266 len. 16]: `` Ye 're awfu ' dubby -LRB- miry -RRB- aboot the feet , Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 9267 len. 32]: Jist gie me aff yer shune , and I 'll gie them a scrape and a lick wi ' the blackin ' - brush , '' said James , again rising .
Parsing [sent. 9268 len. 13]: `` Deil tak ' me gin I do ony sic thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9269 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 9270 len. 9]: `` My shune 'll do weel eneuch . ''
Parsing [sent. 9271 len. 11]: `` Whaur got ye a ' that dub , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 9272 len. 9]: The roads is middlin ' the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 9273 len. 11]: `` I dinna aye stick to the roads , Jeames .
Parsing [sent. 9274 len. 30]: I wan intil a bog first , and syne intil some plooed lan ' that was a ' lumps o ' clay shinin ' green i ' the sun .
Parsing [sent. 9275 len. 11]: Sae it 's nae wonner gin I be some clortit .
Parsing [sent. 9276 len. 20]: Will ye gie me a pitawta , Jeames , in place o ' the blackin ' - brush ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9277 len. 5]: `` Ay , twenty .
Parsing [sent. 9278 len. 18]: But winna ye bide till Mysie comes in , and hae a drappy milk wi ' them ?
Parsing [sent. 9279 len. 8]: They 're fine pitawtas the year . ''
Parsing [sent. 9280 len. 10]: `` Na , na , I haena time . ''
Parsing [sent. 9281 len. 28]: `` Weel , jist dip into the pot , and help yersel ' , sir ; and I 'll luik for a grainy o ' saut . ''
Parsing [sent. 9282 len. 8]: `` Hoo 's yer mistress , Jeames ?
Parsing [sent. 9283 len. 6]: A fine woman that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9284 len. 15]: `` Nae that ill , but some forfochten wi ' norsin ' Mr Alec .
Parsing [sent. 9285 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 9286 len. 16]: sir , that 's a fine lad , gin he wad only haud steady . ''
Parsing [sent. 9287 len. 12]: `` I 'm thinkin ' he winna gang far wrang again .
Parsing [sent. 9288 len. 15]: He 's gotten the arles -LRB- earnest -RRB- and he winna want the wages .
Parsing [sent. 9289 len. 23]: - That 's a fine lassie that 's bidin ' wi ' them - Annie Anderson they ca ' her . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 9290 len. 7]: ` Deed is she , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9291 len. 20]: I kent her father afore her day , and I hae kent her sin ever she had a day .
Parsing [sent. 9292 len. 13]: She 's ane o ' the finest bairns ever was seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 9293 len. 10]: `` Is she ony relation to the mistress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9294 len. 5]: `` Ow , na .
Parsing [sent. 9295 len. 14]: Nae mair relation nor ` at a ' gude fowk 's sib . ''
Parsing [sent. 9296 len. 25]: And Dow told Cupples the girl 's story , including the arrangement made with Bruce in which he had had a principal part . ''
Parsing [sent. 9297 len. 19]: _ Annie Anderson _ - I canna mak ' oot whaur I hae heard her name afore . ''
Parsing [sent. 9298 len. 16]: `` Ye 're bidin ' at Bruce 's , arena ye , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9299 len. 3]: `` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 9300 len. 30]: That is , I 'm sleepin ' there , and payin ' for ` t. '' `` Weel , I hae little doobt ye hae heard it there . ''
Parsing [sent. 9301 len. 6]: `` I dinna think it .
Parsing [sent. 9302 len. 3]: But maybe .
Parsing [sent. 9303 len. 12]: - What kin ' o ' chiel ' 's Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9304 len. 7]: `` He 's terrible greedy . ''
Parsing [sent. 9305 len. 21]: `` A moudiwarp -LRB- mole -RRB- wi ' ae ee wad see that afore he had winkit twice . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 9306 len. 6]: ` Deed micht he . ''
Parsing [sent. 9307 len. 6]: `` Is he honest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9308 len. 7]: `` That 's hard to answer .
Parsing [sent. 9309 len. 19]: But I s ' gar him be honest wi ' regaird to her , gin I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 9310 len. 6]: `` Wad he chait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9311 len. 3]: `` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 9312 len. 2]: Na .
Parsing [sent. 9313 len. 7]: He wadna chait _ muckle _ .
Parsing [sent. 9314 len. 20]: I wadna turn my back till him , though , ohn keekit ower my shouther to haud him sicker .
Parsing [sent. 9315 len. 13]: He wadna min ' doin ' ill that gude micht come . ''
Parsing [sent. 9316 len. 9]: `` Ay , ay ; I ken him .
Parsing [sent. 9317 len. 23]: - And the _ ill _ wad be whatever hurtit anither man , and the _ gude _ whatever furthered himsel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9318 len. 27]: said Mr Cupples as he dipped the last morsel of his third potato in the salt which he held in the palm of his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 9319 len. 10]: `` Ye hae said it , Mr Cupples . ''
Parsing [sent. 9320 len. 17]: And therewith , Mr Cupples bade James good-night , and went to _ the hoose _ .
Parsing [sent. 9321 len. 13]: There he heard the happy news that Alec insisted on seeing him .
Parsing [sent. 9322 len. 18]: Against her will , Mrs Forbes had given in , as the better alternative to vexing him .
Parsing [sent. 9323 len. 24]: The result of the interview was , that Cupples sat up with him that night , and Mrs Forbes and Annie both slept .
Parsing [sent. 9324 len. 25]: In the morning he found a bed ready for him , to which he reluctantly betook himself and slept for a couple of hours .
Parsing [sent. 9325 len. 22]: The end of it was , that he did not go back to Mr Bruce 's except to pay his bill .
Parsing [sent. 9326 len. 9]: Nor did he leave Howglen for many weeks .
Parsing [sent. 9327 len. 52]: At length , one lovely morning , when the green corn lay soaking in the yellow sunlight , and the sky rose above the earth deep and pure and tender like the thought of God about it , Alec became suddenly aware that life was good , and the world beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 9328 len. 9]: He tried to raise himself , but failed .
Parsing [sent. 9329 len. 9]: Cupples was by his side in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 9330 len. 13]: Alec held out his hand with his old smile so long disused .
Parsing [sent. 9331 len. 39]: Cupples propped him up with pillows , and opened the window that the warm waves of the air might break into the cave where he had lain so long deaf to its noises and insensible to its influences .
Parsing [sent. 9332 len. 14]: The tide flowed into his chamber like Pactolus , all golden with sunbeams .
Parsing [sent. 9333 len. 29]: He lay with his hands before him and his eyes closed , looking so happy that Cupples gazed with reverent delight , for he thought he was praying .
Parsing [sent. 9334 len. 6]: But he was only blessed .
Parsing [sent. 9335 len. 9]: So easily can God make a man happy !
Parsing [sent. 9336 len. 15]: The past had dropped from him like a wild but weary and sordid dream .
Parsing [sent. 9337 len. 22]: He was reborn , a new child , in a new bright world , with a glowing summer to revel in .
Parsing [sent. 9338 len. 23]: One of God 's lyric prophets , the larks , was within earshot , pouring down a vocal summer of jubilant melody .
Parsing [sent. 9339 len. 25]: The lark thought nobody was listening but his wife ; but God heard in heaven , and the young prodigal heard on the earth .
Parsing [sent. 9340 len. 20]: He would be a good child henceforth , for one bunch of sunrays was enough to be happy upon .
Parsing [sent. 9341 len. 4]: His mother entered .
Parsing [sent. 9342 len. 36]: She saw the beauty upon her boy 's worn countenance ; she saw the noble watching love on that of his friend ; her own filled with light , and she stood transfixed and silent .
Parsing [sent. 9343 len. 20]: Annie entered , gazed for a moment , fled to her own room , and burst into adoring tears .
Parsing [sent. 9344 len. 32]: - For she had seen the face of God , and that face was Love - love like the human , only deeper , deeper - tenderer , lovelier , stronger .
Parsing [sent. 9345 len. 34]: She could not recall what she had seen , or how she had known it ; but the conviction remained that she had seen his face , and that it was infinitely beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 9346 len. 15]: `` He has been wi ' me a ' the time , my God !
Parsing [sent. 9347 len. 31]: He gied me my father , and sent Broonie to tak ' care o ' me , and Dooie , and Thomas Crann , and Mrs Forbes , and Alec .
Parsing [sent. 9348 len. 14]: And he sent the cat whan I gaed till him aboot the rottans .
Parsing [sent. 9349 len. 21]: An ' he 's been wi ' me I kenna hoo lang , and he 's wi ' me noo .
Parsing [sent. 9350 len. 15]: And I hae seen his face , and I 'll see his face again .
Parsing [sent. 9351 len. 11]: And I 'll try sair to be a gude bairn .
Parsing [sent. 9352 len. 3]: Eh me !
Parsing [sent. 9353 len. 5]: It 's jist wonnerfu !
Parsing [sent. 9354 len. 12]: And God 's jist ... naething but God himsel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 9355 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXX .
Parsing [sent. 9356 len. 41]: Although Mr Cupples had been educated for the Church , and was indeed at this present time a licentiate , he had given up all thought of pursuing what had been his mother 's ambition rather than his own choice .
Parsing [sent. 9357 len. 62]: But his thoughts had not ceased to run in some of the old grooves , although a certain scepticism would sometimes set him examining those grooves to find out whether they had been made by the wheels of the gospel-chariot , or by those of Juggernaut in the disguise of a Hebrew high priest , drawn by a shouting Christian people .
Parsing [sent. 9358 len. 41]: Indeed , as soon as he ceased to go to church , which was soon after ceasing to regard the priesthood as his future profession , he began to look at many things from points of view not exclusively ecclesiastical .
Parsing [sent. 9359 len. 37]: So that , although he did go to church at Glamerton for several Sundays , the day arriving when he could not face it again , he did not scruple to set off for the hills .
Parsing [sent. 9360 len. 35]: Coming home with a great grand purple foxglove in his hand , he met some of the missionars returning from their chapel , and amongst the rest Robert Bruce , who stopped and spoke .
Parsing [sent. 9361 len. 21]: `` I 'm surprised to see ye carryin ' that thing o ' the Lord 's day , Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 9362 len. 9]: Fowk 'll think ill o ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 9363 len. 41]: `` Weel , ye see , Mr Bruce , it angert me sae to see the ill-faured thing positeevely growin ' there upo ' the Lord 's day , that I pu 'd it up ` maist by the reet .
Parsing [sent. 9364 len. 25]: To think o ' a weyd like that prankin ' itsel ' oot in its purple and its spots upo ' the Sawbath day !
Parsing [sent. 9365 len. 8]: It canna ken what it 's aboot .
Parsing [sent. 9366 len. 19]: I 'm only feared I left eneuch o ' ' t to be up again afore lang . ''
Parsing [sent. 9367 len. 19]: `` I doobt , Mr Cupples , ye haena come unner the pooer o ' grace yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 9368 len. 10]: `` A pour o ' creysh -LRB- grease -RRB- !
Parsing [sent. 9369 len. 5]: Na , thank ye .
Parsing [sent. 9370 len. 12]: I dinna want to come unner a pour o ' creysh .
Parsing [sent. 9371 len. 8]: It wad blaud me a ` thegither .
Parsing [sent. 9372 len. 12]: Is that the gait ye baptize i ' your conventicle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9373 len. 20]: `` There 's nane sae deif 's them ` at winna hear , Mr Cupples , '' said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 9374 len. 11]: `` I mean - ye 're no convertit yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 9375 len. 3]: `` Na .
Parsing [sent. 9376 len. 5]: I 'm no convertit .
Parsing [sent. 9377 len. 4]: ` Deed no .
Parsing [sent. 9378 len. 7]: I wadna like to be convertit .
Parsing [sent. 9379 len. 7]: What wad ye convert me till ?
Parsing [sent. 9380 len. 3]: A swine ?
Parsing [sent. 9381 len. 24]: Or a sma ' peddlin ' crater that tak 's a bawbee mair for rowin ' up the pigtail in a foul paper ?
Parsing [sent. 9382 len. 6]: Ca ' ye that conversion ?
Parsing [sent. 9383 len. 8]: I 'll bide as I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 9384 len. 28]: `` It 's waste o ' precious time speikin ' to you , Mr Cupples , '' returned Bruce , moving off with a red face . ''
Parsing [sent. 9385 len. 21]: ` Deed is ` t , '' retorted Cupples ; `` and I houp ye winna forget the fac ' ?
Parsing [sent. 9386 len. 9]: It 's o ' consequens to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9387 len. 31]: But he had quite another word on the same subject for Annie Anderson , whom he overtook on her way to Howglen - she likewise returning from the missionar kirk .
Parsing [sent. 9388 len. 18]: `` Isna that a bonnie ring o ' _ deid man 's bells _ , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9389 len. 21]: said he , holding out the foxglove , and calling it by its name in that part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 9390 len. 6]: `` Ay is ` t .
Parsing [sent. 9391 len. 17]: But that was ower muckle a flooer to tak ' to the kirk wi ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 9392 len. 8]: Ye wad gar the fowk lauch . ''
Parsing [sent. 9393 len. 16]: `` What 's the richt flooer to tak ' to the kirk , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9394 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 9395 len. 15]: sober floories that smell o ' the yird -LRB- earth -RRB- , like . ''
Parsing [sent. 9396 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 9397 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 9398 len. 6]: Sic like 's what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9399 len. 16]: asked Cupples , for he had found in Annie a poetic nature that delighted him .
Parsing [sent. 9400 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 9401 len. 16]: sic like 's thyme and southren-wood , and maybe a bittie o ' mignonette . ''
Parsing [sent. 9402 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 9403 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 9404 len. 17]: And sae the cowmon custom abuses you , young , bonnie lammies o ' the flock .
Parsing [sent. 9405 len. 26]: Wadna ye tak ' the rose o ' Sharon itsel ' , nor the fire-reid lilies that made the text for the Saviour 's sermon ?
Parsing [sent. 9406 len. 2]: Ow !
Parsing [sent. 9407 len. 2]: na .
Parsing [sent. 9408 len. 38]: Ye maun be sober , wi ' flooers bonnie eneuch , but smellin ' o ' the kirkyard raither nor the blue lift , which same 's the sapphire throne o ' Him that sat thereon . ''
Parsing [sent. 9409 len. 39]: `` Weel , but allooin ' that , ye sudna gar fowk lauch , wi ' a bonnie flooer , but ridickleous for the size o ' ` t , ` cep ' ye gie ' t room .
Parsing [sent. 9410 len. 18]: A kirk 's ower little for ` t. '' `` Ye 're richt there , my dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 9411 len. 10]: And I haena been to the kirk ava ' .
Parsing [sent. 9412 len. 8]: I hae been to the hills . ''
Parsing [sent. 9413 len. 8]: `` And what got ye there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9414 len. 11]: `` I got this upo ' the road hame . ''
Parsing [sent. 9415 len. 8]: `` But what got ye there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9416 len. 10]: `` Weel , I got the blue lift . ''
Parsing [sent. 9417 len. 9]: `` And what was that to ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9418 len. 54]: `` It _ said _ to me that I was a foolish man to care aboot the claiks and the strifes o ' the warl ' ; for a ' was quaiet aboon , whatever stramash they micht be makin ' doon here i ' the cellars o ' the speeritual creation . ''
Parsing [sent. 9419 len. 26]: Annie was silent : while she did not quite understand him , she had a dim perception of a grand meaning in what he said .
Parsing [sent. 9420 len. 24]: The fact was that Annie was the greater of the two _ in esse _ ; Cupples the greater _ in posse _ .
Parsing [sent. 9421 len. 18]: His imagination let him see things far beyond what he could for a long time attain unto .
Parsing [sent. 9422 len. 12]: `` But what got ye at the kirk , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9423 len. 13]: `` Weel , I canna say I got verra muckle the day .
Parsing [sent. 9424 len. 27]: Mr Turnbull 's text was , ` Thou , Lord , art merciful , for thou renderest to every man according to his works . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 9425 len. 13]: `` Ye micht hae gotten a hantel oot o ' that . ''
Parsing [sent. 9426 len. 3]: `` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 9427 len. 25]: But ye see , he said the Lord was merciful to ither fowk whan he rendert to the wicked the punishment due to them .
Parsing [sent. 9428 len. 20]: And I cudna richtly feel i ' my hert that I cud praise the Lord for that mercy . ''
Parsing [sent. 9429 len. 9]: `` I dinna wonner , my bairn . ''
Parsing [sent. 9430 len. 4]: `` But eh !
Parsing [sent. 9431 len. 11]: Mr Cupples , Mr Turnbull 's no like that aye .
Parsing [sent. 9432 len. 9]: He 's bonnie upo ' the Gospel news .
Parsing [sent. 9433 len. 11]: I wiss ye wad gang and hear him the nicht .
Parsing [sent. 9434 len. 12]: I canna gang , cause Mrs Forbes is gaun oot . ''
Parsing [sent. 9435 len. 31]: `` I 'll gang and hear him , to please you , my lassie ; for , as I said , I haena been to the kirk the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 9436 len. 17]: `` But do ye think it 's richt to brak the Sawbath , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9437 len. 6]: `` Ay and no . ''
Parsing [sent. 9438 len. 8]: `` I dinna unnerstan ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 9439 len. 47]: `` What the clergy ca ' brakin ' the Sawbath 's no brakin ' o ' ` t. I 'll tell ye what seems to me the differ atween the like o ' your Mr Turnbull and the Pharisees - and it 's a great differ .
Parsing [sent. 9440 len. 47]: They band heavy burdens and grievous to be borne , and laid them upo ' men 's shouthers , but wadna touch sic like to carry them wi ' ane o ' their fingers : Mr Turnbull and the like o ' him beirs their share .
Parsing [sent. 9441 len. 17]: But the burden 's nane the less a heavy ane and grievous to be borne . ''
Parsing [sent. 9442 len. 17]: `` But the burden 's no _ that _ grievous to me , Mr Cupples . ''
Parsing [sent. 9443 len. 33]: `` There 's no sayin ' what you women-fowk will _ not _ tak ' a pleesur ' in bearin ' ; but the passage refers expressly to the men 's shouthers .
Parsing [sent. 9444 len. 20]: And faith mine _ will _ not endure to be loadent wi ' ither fowks fykes -LRB- trifles -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 9445 len. 11]: And sae come alang , deid man 's bells . ''
Parsing [sent. 9446 len. 37]: Annie thought all this rather dreadful , but she was not shocked as a Christian who lives by the clergy and their traditions , instead of by the fresh Spirit of God , would have been .
Parsing [sent. 9447 len. 13]: For she could not help seeing that there was truth in it .
Parsing [sent. 9448 len. 42]: But although Cupples could say much to set Annie thinking , and although she did find enlightenment at last from pondering over his words , yet she could have told him far deeper things than he had yet suspected to exist .
Parsing [sent. 9449 len. 15]: For she knew that the goal of all life is the face of God .
Parsing [sent. 9450 len. 47]: Perhaps she had to learn a yet higher lesson : that our one free home is the Heart , the eternal lovely Will of God , than that which should fail , it were better that we and all the worlds should go out in blackness .
Parsing [sent. 9451 len. 7]: But this Will is our Salvation .
Parsing [sent. 9452 len. 8]: Because He liveth we shall live also .
Parsing [sent. 9453 len. 14]: Mr Cupples found in the missionar kirk a certain fervour which pleased him .
Parsing [sent. 9454 len. 46]: For Mr Turnbull , finding that his appeals to the ungodly were now of little avail to attract listeners of the class , had betaken himself to the building up of the body of Christ , dwelling in particular upon the love of the brethren .
Parsing [sent. 9455 len. 34]: But how some of them were to be loved , except with the love of compassionate indignation , even his most rapt listener Thomas Crann could not have supposed himself capable of explaining .
Parsing [sent. 9456 len. 20]: As I said , however , Mr Cupples found the sermon in some degree impressive , and was attentive .
Parsing [sent. 9457 len. 20]: As he was walking away , questioning with himself , he heard a voice in the air above him .
Parsing [sent. 9458 len. 30]: It came from the lips of Thomas Crann , who , although stooping from asthma and rheumatism , still rose nearly a foot above the head of Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 9459 len. 17]: `` I was glaid to see ye at oor kirk , sir , '' said Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 9460 len. 6]: `` What for that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9461 len. 30]: returned the librarian , who always repelled first approaches , in which he was only like Thomas himself , and many other worthy people , both Scotch and English .
Parsing [sent. 9462 len. 13]: `` A stranger sud aye be welcomed to onybody 's hoose . ''
Parsing [sent. 9463 len. 10]: `` I didna ken it was your hoose . ''
Parsing [sent. 9464 len. 4]: `` Ow na .
Parsing [sent. 9465 len. 6]: It 's no my hoose .
Parsing [sent. 9466 len. 7]: It 's the Lord 's hoose .
Parsing [sent. 9467 len. 60]: But a smile frae the servan ' - lass that opens the door 's something till a man that gangs to ony hoose for the first time , ye ken , '' returned Thomas , who , like many men of rough address , was instantly put upon his good behaviour by the exhibition of like roughness in another .
Parsing [sent. 9468 len. 5]: This answer disarmed Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 9469 len. 109]: He looked up into Thomas 's face , and saw first a massive chin ; then a firmly closed mouth ; then a nose , straight as a Greek 's , but bulky and of a rough texture ; then two keen grey eyes , and lastly a big square forehead supported by the two pedestals of high cheek bones - the whole looking as if it had been hewn out of his professional granite , or rather as if the look of the granite had passed into the face that was so constantly bent over it fashioning the stubborn substance to the yet more stubborn human will .
Parsing [sent. 9470 len. 41]: And Cupples not only liked the face , but felt that he was in the presence of one of the higher natures of the world - made to command , or rather , which is far better , to influence .
Parsing [sent. 9471 len. 34]: Before he had time to reply , however , Thomas resumed : `` Ye hae had a heap o ' tribble , I doobt , wi ' that laddie , Alec Forbes . ''
Parsing [sent. 9472 len. 11]: `` Naething mair nor was nateral , '' answered Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 9473 len. 9]: `` He 's a fine crater , though .
Parsing [sent. 9474 len. 5]: I ken that weel .
Parsing [sent. 9475 len. 10]: Is he come back , do ye think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9476 len. 6]: `` What do ye mean ?
Parsing [sent. 9477 len. 15]: He 's lyin ' in 's bed , quaiet eneuch , puir fallow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9478 len. 10]: `` Is he come back to the fold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9479 len. 12]: `` Nae to the missionars , I 'm thinkin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 9480 len. 5]: `` Dinna anger me .
Parsing [sent. 9481 len. 11]: Ye 're nae sae ignorant as ye wad pass for .
Parsing [sent. 9482 len. 8]: Ye ken weel eneuch what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 9483 len. 35]: What care I for the missionars mair nor ony ither o ' the Lord 's fowk , ` cep that they 're mair like his fowk nor ony ither that I hae seen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9484 len. 12]: `` Sic like 's Robert Bruce , for a sample . ''
Parsing [sent. 9485 len. 19]: Thomas stopped as if he had struck against a stone wall , and went back on his track .
Parsing [sent. 9486 len. 29]: `` What I want to ken is whether Alec unnerstans yet that the prodigal 's aye ill aff ; and - '' `` Na , '' interrupted Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 9487 len. 11]: `` He 's never been cawed to the swine yet .
Parsing [sent. 9488 len. 19]: Nor he sudna be , sae lang 's I had a saxpence to halve wi ' him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9489 len. 13]: `` Ye 're no richt , frien ' , _ there _ .
Parsing [sent. 9490 len. 12]: The suner a prodigal comes to the swine the better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9491 len. 12]: `` Ay ; that 's what you richteous elder brithers think .
Parsing [sent. 9492 len. 7]: I ken that weel eneuch . ''
Parsing [sent. 9493 len. 14]: `` Mr Cupples , I 'm nae elder brither i ' that sense .
Parsing [sent. 9494 len. 12]: God kens I wad gang oot to lat him in . ''
Parsing [sent. 9495 len. 15]: `` What ken ye aboot him , gin it be a fair queston ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9496 len. 14]: `` I hae kent him , sir , sin he was a bairn .
Parsing [sent. 9497 len. 16]: I perilled his life - no my ain - to gar him do his duty .
Parsing [sent. 9498 len. 17]: I trust in God it wad hae been easier for me to hae perilled my ain .
Parsing [sent. 9499 len. 10]: Sae ye see I do ken aboot him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9500 len. 25]: `` Weel , '' said Mr Cupples , to whom the nature of Thomas had begun to open itself , `` I alloo that .
Parsing [sent. 9501 len. 5]: Whaur do ye bide ?
Parsing [sent. 9502 len. 5]: What 's yer name ?
Parsing [sent. 9503 len. 18]: I 'll come and see ye the morn 's nicht , gin ye 'll lat me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9504 len. 7]: `` My name 's Thomas Crann .
Parsing [sent. 9505 len. 5]: I 'm a stonemason .
Parsing [sent. 9506 len. 17]: Speir at Robert Bruce 's chop , and they 'll direc ye to whaur I bide .
Parsing [sent. 9507 len. 11]: Ye may come the morn 's nicht , and welcome .
Parsing [sent. 9508 len. 6]: Can ye sup parritch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9509 len. 7]: `` Ay , weel that . ''
Parsing [sent. 9510 len. 11]: `` My Jean 's an extrornar han ' at parritch .
Parsing [sent. 9511 len. 13]: I only houp puir Esau had half as guid for 's birthricht .
Parsing [sent. 9512 len. 10]: Ye 'll hae a drappy wi ' me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9513 len. 12]: `` Wi ' a ' my hert , '' answered Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 9514 len. 6]: And here their ways diverged .
Parsing [sent. 9515 len. 11]: When he reached home , he asked Annie about Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 9516 len. 23]: Annie spoke of him in the highest terms , adding , `` I 'm glaid ye like him , Mr Cupples . ''
Parsing [sent. 9517 len. 37]: `` I dinna think , wi ' sic an opingon o ' 'm , it can maitter muckle to you whether I like him or no , '' returned Mr Cupples , looking at her quizzically .
Parsing [sent. 9518 len. 9]: `` Na , nae muckle as regairds him .
Parsing [sent. 9519 len. 18]: But it says weel for you , ye ken , Mr Cupples , '' replied Annie archly .
Parsing [sent. 9520 len. 27]: Mr Cupples laughed good-humouredly , and said , `` Weel , I s ' gang and see him the morn 's nicht , ony gait . ''
Parsing [sent. 9521 len. 5]: And so he did .
Parsing [sent. 9522 len. 10]: And the porridge and the milk were both good .
Parsing [sent. 9523 len. 13]: `` This is heumble fare , Mr Cupples , '' said Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 9524 len. 30]: `` It maitters little compairateevely what a man lives upo ' , '' said Cupples sententiously , `` sae it be first-rate o ' ` ts ain kin ' .
Parsing [sent. 9525 len. 8]: And this _ is _ first-rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 9526 len. 10]: `` Tak ' a drappy mair , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 9527 len. 11]: `` Na , nae mair , I thank ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 9528 len. 11]: `` They 'll be left , gin ye dinna . ''
Parsing [sent. 9529 len. 20]: `` Weel , sen ' them ower to Mr Bruce , '' said Cupples , with a sly wink .
Parsing [sent. 9530 len. 17]: `` I s ' warran ' he 'll coup them ower afore they sud be wastit .
Parsing [sent. 9531 len. 6]: He canna bide waste . ''
Parsing [sent. 9532 len. 8]: `` Weel , that 's a vertue .
Parsing [sent. 9533 len. 12]: The Saviour himsel ' garred them gaither up the fragments . ''
Parsing [sent. 9534 len. 4]: `` Nae doobt .
Parsing [sent. 9535 len. 22]: But I 'm feared Bruce wad hae coontit the waste by hoo mony o ' the baskets gaed by his door .
Parsing [sent. 9536 len. 28]: I 'm surprised at ye , Mr Crann , tryin ' to defen ' sic a meeserable crater , jist 'cause he gangs to your kirk . ''
Parsing [sent. 9537 len. 15]: `` Weel , he is a meeserable crater , and I canna bide him .
Parsing [sent. 9538 len. 15]: He 's jist a Jonah in oor ship , an Achan in oor camp .
Parsing [sent. 9539 len. 14]: But I sudna speyk sae to ane that 's no a member . ''
Parsing [sent. 9540 len. 6]: `` Never ye min ' .
Parsing [sent. 9541 len. 12]: I 'm auld eneuch to hae learned to haud my tongue .
Parsing [sent. 9542 len. 10]: But we 'll turn till a better subjec ' .
Parsing [sent. 9543 len. 14]: Jist tell me hoo ye made Alec peril 's life for conscience sake .
Parsing [sent. 9544 len. 19]: Ye dinna burn fowk here for nae freely haudin ' by the shorter Carritchis , do ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9545 len. 9]: And hereupon followed the story of the flood .
Parsing [sent. 9546 len. 22]: Both these men , notwithstanding the defiance they bore on their shields , were of the most friendly and communicative disposition .
Parsing [sent. 9547 len. 15]: So soon as they saw that a neighbour was trustworthy , they trusted him .
Parsing [sent. 9548 len. 12]: Hence it is not marvellous that communication should have been mutual .
Parsing [sent. 9549 len. 21]: Cupples told Thomas in return how he had come to know Alec , and what compact had arisen between them .
Parsing [sent. 9550 len. 57]: Thomas , as soon as he understood Mr Cupples 's sacrifice , caught the delicate hand in his granite grasp - like that with which the steel anvil and the stone block held Arthur 's sword - and said solemnly , `` Ye hae done a great deed , which winna gang wantin ' its reward .
Parsing [sent. 9551 len. 14]: It canna hae merit , but it maun be pleesant in His sicht .
Parsing [sent. 9552 len. 24]: Ye hae baith conquered sin i ' yersel , and ye hae turned the sinner frae the error o ' his ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 9553 len. 4]: `` Hoots ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9554 len. 32]: interrupted Cupples , `` do ye think I was gaun to lat the laddie gang reid-wud to the deevil , ohn stud in afore 'm and cried _ Hooly _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9555 len. 11]: After this the two were friends , and met often .
Parsing [sent. 9556 len. 16]: Cupples went to the missionars again and again , and they generally walked away together .
Parsing [sent. 9557 len. 24]: `` What gart ye turn frae the kirk o ' yer fathers , and tak to a conventicle like that , Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9558 len. 6]: asked Mr Cupples one evening .
Parsing [sent. 9559 len. 29]: `` Ye hae been to them baith , and I wad hae thocht ye wad hae kent better nor to speir sic a question , '' answered Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 9560 len. 5]: `` Ay , ay .
Parsing [sent. 9561 len. 12]: But what gart ye think o ' ' t first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9562 len. 11]: `` Weel , I 'll tell ye the haill story .
Parsing [sent. 9563 len. 57]: Whan I was a callan , I took the play to mysel ' for a week , or maybe twa , and gaed wi ' a frien ' i ' the same trade 's mysel ' , to see what was to be seen alang a screed o ' the sea-coast , frae toon to toon .
Parsing [sent. 9564 len. 40]: My compaingon wasna that gude at the traivellin ' ; and upo ' the Setterday nicht , there we war in a public-hoose , and him no able to gang ae fit further , for sair heels and taes .
Parsing [sent. 9565 len. 27]: Sae we bude to bide still ower the Sawbath , though we wad fain hae been oot ' o ' the toon afore the kirk began .
Parsing [sent. 9566 len. 39]: But seein ' that we cudna , I thocht it wad be but dacent to gang to the kirk like ither fowk , and sae I made mysel ' as snod as I could , and gaed oot .
Parsing [sent. 9567 len. 18]: And afore I had gane mony yairds , I cam upo ' fowk gaein to the kirk .
Parsing [sent. 9568 len. 33]: And sae I loot the stream carry me alang wi ' ` t , and gaed in and sat doon , though the place wasna exackly like a kirk a ` thegither .
Parsing [sent. 9569 len. 51]: But the minister had a gift o ' prayer and o ' preaching as weel ; and the fowk a ' sang as gi n't was pairt o ' their business to praise God , for fear he wad tak it frae them and gie ' t to the stanes .
Parsing [sent. 9570 len. 83]: Whan I cam oot , and was gaein quaietly back to the public , there cam first ae sober-luikin man up to me , and he wad hae me hame to my denner ; and syne their cam an auld man , and efter that a man that luikit like a sutor , and ane and a ' o ' them wad hae me hame to my denner wi ' them - for no airthly rizzon but that I was a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 9571 len. 20]: But ye see I cudna gang 'cause my frien ' was waitin ' for his till I gaed back .
Parsing [sent. 9572 len. 72]: Efter denner , I speirt at the landlady gin she cud tell me what they ca 'd themsels , the fowk ` at gathered i ' that pairt o ' the toon ; and says she , ' I dinna ken what they ca ' them - they 're nae customers o ' mine - but I jist ken this , they 're hard-workin ' fowk , kind to ane anither .
Parsing [sent. 9573 len. 5]: A'body trusts their word .
Parsing [sent. 9574 len. 51]: Gif ony o ' them be sick , the rest luiks efter them till they 're better ; and gin ony o ' them happens to gang the wrang gait , there 's aye three or four o ' them aboot him , till they get him set richt again .
Parsing [sent. 9575 len. 33]: ` Weel , ' says I , ' I dinna care what they ca ' them ; but gin ever I jine ony kirk , that s ' be the kirk . '
Parsing [sent. 9576 len. 55]: Sae , efter that , whan ance I had gotten a sure houp , a rael grun ' for believin ' that I was ane o ' the called and chosen , I jist jined mysel ' to them that sud be like them - for they ca 'd them a ' Missionars . ''
Parsing [sent. 9577 len. 8]: `` Is that lang sin syne ? ''

''
Parsing [sent. 9612 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXXI .
Parsing [sent. 9613 len. 46]: Annie began to perceive that it was time for her to go , partly from the fact that she was no longer wanted so much , and partly from finding in herself certain conditions of feeling which she did not know what to do with .
Parsing [sent. 9614 len. 40]: `` Annie 's coming back to you in a day or two , Mr Bruce , '' said Mrs Forbes , having called to pay some of her interest , and wishing to prepare the way for her return .
Parsing [sent. 9615 len. 27]: `` She has been with me a long time , but you know she was ill , and I could not part with her besides . ''
Parsing [sent. 9616 len. 39]: `` Weel , mem , '' answered Bruce , `` we 'll be verra happy to tak ' her hame again , as sune 's ye hae had a ' the use ye want o ' her . ''
Parsing [sent. 9617 len. 18]: He had never assumed this tone before , either to Mrs Forbes or with regard to Annie .
Parsing [sent. 9618 len. 8]: But she took no notice of it .
Parsing [sent. 9619 len. 21]: Both Mr and Mrs Bruce received the girl so kindly that she did not know what to make of it .
Parsing [sent. 9620 len. 14]: Mr Bruce especially was all sugar and butter - rancid butter of course .
Parsing [sent. 9621 len. 15]: When she went up to her old rat-haunted room , her astonishment was doubled .
Parsing [sent. 9622 len. 43]: For the holes in floor and roof had been mended ; the sky-light was as clean as glass a hundred years old could be ; a square of carpet lay in the middle of the floor ; and cheque-curtains adorned the bed .
Parsing [sent. 9623 len. 25]: She concluded that these luxuries had been procured for Mr Cupples , but could not understand how they came to be left for her .
Parsing [sent. 9624 len. 32]: Nor did the consideration shown her decrease after the first novelty of her return had worn off ; and altogether the main sources of her former discomfort had ceased to flow .
Parsing [sent. 9625 len. 28]: The baby had become a sweet-tempered little girl ; Johnnie was at school all day ; and Robert was a comparatively well-behaved , though still sulky youth .
Parsing [sent. 9626 len. 17]: He gave himself great airs to his former companions , but to Annie he was condescending .
Parsing [sent. 9627 len. 19]: He was a good student , and had the use of _ the room _ for a study .
Parsing [sent. 9628 len. 23]: Robert Bruce the elder had disclosed his projects to his heir , and he had naturally declined all effort for their realization .
Parsing [sent. 9629 len. 48]: But he began at length to observe that Annie had grown very pretty ; and then he thought it would be a nice thing to fall in love with her , since , from his parents ' wishes to that end , she must have some money .
Parsing [sent. 9630 len. 30]: Annie , however , did not suspect anything , till , one day , she overheard the elder say to the younger , `` Ye dinna push , man .
Parsing [sent. 9631 len. 27]: Gang benn to the chop and get a cnottie o ' reid candy-sugar , and gie her that the neist time ye see her her lane .
Parsing [sent. 9632 len. 10]: The likes o ' her kens what that means .
Parsing [sent. 9633 len. 20]: And gin she tak 's ' t frae ye , ye may hae the run o ' the drawer .
Parsing [sent. 9634 len. 8]: It 's worth while , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 9635 len. 9]: Them ` at winna saw winna reap . ''
Parsing [sent. 9636 len. 9]: From that moment she was on her guard .
Parsing [sent. 9637 len. 17]: Nor did she give the youth a chance of putting his father 's advice into operation .
Parsing [sent. 9638 len. 34]: Meantime Alec got better and better , went out with Mr Cupples in the gig , ate like an ogre , drank like a hippopotamus , and was rapidly recovering his former strength .
Parsing [sent. 9639 len. 56]: As he grew better , his former grief did draw nearer , but such was the freshness of his new life , that he seemed to have died and risen again like Lazarus , leaving his sorrow behind him in the grave , to be communed with only in those dim seasons when ghosts walk .
Parsing [sent. 9640 len. 18]: One evening over their supper , he was opposing Mr Cupples 's departure for the twentieth time .
Parsing [sent. 9641 len. 24]: At length the latter said : `` Alec , I 'll bide wi ' ye till the neist session upon ae condition . ''
Parsing [sent. 9642 len. 9]: `` What is that , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9643 len. 4]: said Mrs Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 9644 len. 10]: `` I shall be delighted to know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9645 len. 46]: `` Ye see , mem , this young rascal here made a fule o ' ` msel ' last session and didna pass ; and - '' `` Let bygones be bygones , if you please , Mr Cupples , said Mrs Forbes pleasantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9646 len. 6]: ` Deed no , mem .
Parsing [sent. 9647 len. 18]: What 's the use o ' byganes but to learn frae them hoo to meet the bycomes ?
Parsing [sent. 9648 len. 28]: Ye 'll please to hear me oot ; and gin Alec doesna like to hear me , he maun jist sit _ and _ hear me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9649 len. 11]: `` Fire away , Mr Cupples , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 9650 len. 4]: `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 9651 len. 84]: - For them that didna pass i ' the en ' o ' the last session , there 's an examination i ' the beginnin ' o ' the neist - gin they like to stan ' ` t. Gin they dinna , they maun gang throu the same classes ower again , and stan ' the examination at the end - that is , gin they want a degree ; and that 's a terrible loss o ' time for the start .
Parsing [sent. 9652 len. 42]: Noo , gin Alec 'll set to wark like a man , I 'll help him a ' that I can ; and by the gatherin ' again , he 'll be up wi ' the lave o ' the fleet .
Parsing [sent. 9653 len. 2]: Faith !
Parsing [sent. 9654 len. 22]: I 'll sit like Deith i ' the spectre-bark , and blaw intil his sails a ' that I can blaw .
Parsing [sent. 9655 len. 18]: Maybe ye dinna ken that verse i ' _ The Rhyme o ' the Ancient Mariner _ ?
Parsing [sent. 9656 len. 43]: It was left oot o ' the later editions : ' A gust of wind sterte up behind , And whistled through his bones ; Through the holes of his eyes and the hole of his mouth , Half-whistles and half-groans . '
Parsing [sent. 9657 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 9658 len. 12]: that 's spicy - for them ` at likes ghaistry . ''
Parsing [sent. 9659 len. 6]: That very day Alec resumed .
Parsing [sent. 9660 len. 18]: Mr Cupples would not let him work a moment after he began to show symptoms of fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 9661 len. 20]: But the limit was moved further and further every day , till at length he could work four hours .
Parsing [sent. 9662 len. 17]: His tutor would not hear of any further extension , and declared he would pass triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 9663 len. 37]: The rest of the summer-day they spent in wandering about , or lying in the grass , for it was a hot and dry summer , so that the grass was a very bed of health .
Parsing [sent. 9664 len. 9]: Then came all the pleasures of the harvest .
Parsing [sent. 9665 len. 27]: And when the evenings grew cool , there were the books that Mr Cupples foraged for in Glamerton , seeming to find them by the scent .
Parsing [sent. 9666 len. 36]: And Mr Cupples tried to lead Alec into philosophical ways of regarding things ; for he had just enough of religion to get some good of philosophy - which itself is the religion of skeletons .
Parsing [sent. 9667 len. 18]: `` Ye see , '' he would say , `` it 's pairt o ' the machine .
Parsing [sent. 9668 len. 45]: What a body has to do is to learn what pinion or steam-box , or piston , or muckle water-wheel he represents , and stick to that , defyin ' the deevil , whase wark is to put the machine out o ' gear .
Parsing [sent. 9669 len. 31]: And sae he maun grin ' awa ' , and whan Deith comes , he 'll say , as Andrew Wylie did - ` Weel run , little wheelie ! '
Parsing [sent. 9670 len. 34]: and tak ' him awa ' wi ' him some gait or ither , whaur , maybe , he may mak ' choice o ' his ain machine for the neist trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 9671 len. 15]: `` That 's some cauld doctrine , Mr Cupples , '' Alec would say .
Parsing [sent. 9672 len. 30]: `` Weel , '' he would return with a smile , `` gang to yer frien ' Thamas Crann , and he 'll gie ye something a hantle better .
Parsing [sent. 9673 len. 16]: That 's ane o ' the maist extrornar men I ever made acquantance wi ' .
Parsing [sent. 9674 len. 14]: He 'll gie ye divine philosophy - a dooms sicht better nor mine .
Parsing [sent. 9675 len. 4]: But , eh !
Parsing [sent. 9676 len. 9]: he 's saft for a ' that . ''
Parsing [sent. 9677 len. 14]: Annie would have got more good from these readings than either of them .
Parsing [sent. 9678 len. 67]: Mr Cupples was puzzled to account for her absence , but came to see into the mother 's defensive strategy , who had not yet learned to leave such things to themselves ; though she might have known by this time that the bubbles of scheming mothers , positive or negative , however well-blown , are in danger of collapsing into a drop of burning poison .
Parsing [sent. 9679 len. 20]: He missed Annie very much , and went often to see her , taking her what books he could .
Parsing [sent. 9680 len. 62]: With one or other of these she would wander along the banks of the clear brown Glamour , now watching it as it subdued its rocks or lay asleep in its shadowy pools , now reading a page or two , or now seating herself on the grass , and letting the dove of peace fold its wings upon her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 9681 len. 17]: Even her new love did not more than occasionally ruffle the flow of her inward river .
Parsing [sent. 9682 len. 14]: She had long cherished a deeper love , which kept it very calm .
Parsing [sent. 9683 len. 45]: Her stillness was always wandering into prayer ; but never did she offer a petition that associated Alec 's fate with her own ; though sometimes she would find herself holding up her heart like an empty cup which knew that it was empty .
Parsing [sent. 9684 len. 6]: She missed Tibbie Dyster dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 9685 len. 40]: One day , thinking she heard Mr Cupples come upstairs , she ran down with a smile on her face , which fell off it like a withered leaf when she saw no one there but Robert the student .
Parsing [sent. 9686 len. 21]: He , taking the smile for himself , rose and approached her with an ugly response on his heavy countenance .
Parsing [sent. 9687 len. 22]: She turned and flew up again to her room ; whither to her horror he followed her , demanding a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 9688 len. 60]: An ordinary Scotch maiden of Annie 's rank would have answered such a request from a man she did not like with a box on the ear , tolerably delivered ; but Annie was too proud even to struggle , and submitted like a marble statue , except that she could not help wiping her lips after the salute .
Parsing [sent. 9689 len. 19]: The youth walked away more discomfited than if she had made angry protestations , and a successful resistance .
Parsing [sent. 9690 len. 6]: Annie sat down and cried .
Parsing [sent. 9691 len. 11]: Her former condition in the house was enviable to this .
Parsing [sent. 9692 len. 46]: - That same evening , without saying a word to any one , for there was a curious admixture of outward lawlessness with the perfect inward obedience of the girl , she set out for Clippenstrae , on the opposite bank of the Wan Water .
Parsing [sent. 9693 len. 6]: It was a gorgeous evening .
Parsing [sent. 9694 len. 25]: The sun was going down in purple and crimson , divided by such bars of gold as never grew in the mines of Ophir .
Parsing [sent. 9695 len. 30]: A faint rosy mist hung its veil over the hills about the sunset ; and a torrent of red light streamed down the westward road by which she went .
Parsing [sent. 9696 len. 17]: The air was soft , and the light sobered with a sense of the coming twilight .
Parsing [sent. 9697 len. 21]: It was such an evening as we have , done into English , in the ninth Evening Voluntary of Wordsworth .
Parsing [sent. 9698 len. 6]: And Annie felt it such .
Parsing [sent. 9699 len. 15]: Thank God , is does not need a poetic education to feel such things .
Parsing [sent. 9700 len. 56]: It needs a poetic education to _ say _ such things so , that another , not seeing , yet shall see ; but that such a child as Annie should not be able to feel them , would be the one argument to destroy our belief in the genuineness of the poet 's vision .
Parsing [sent. 9701 len. 14]: For if so , can the vision have come from Nature 's self ?
Parsing [sent. 9702 len. 22]: Has it not rather been evoked by the magic rod of the poet 's will from his own chambers of imagery ?
Parsing [sent. 9703 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXXII .
Parsing [sent. 9704 len. 14]: When she reached Clippenstrae , she found that she had been sent there .
Parsing [sent. 9705 len. 28]: Her aunt came from the inner room as she opened the door , and she knew at once by her face that Death was in the house .
Parsing [sent. 9706 len. 13]: For its expression recalled the sad vision of her father 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 9707 len. 22]: Her great-uncle , the little grey-headed old cottar in the Highland bonnet , lay dying - in the Highland bonnet still .
Parsing [sent. 9708 len. 52]: He was going to `` the land o ' the Leal '' -LRB- loyal -RRB- , the true-hearted , to wait for his wife , whose rheumatism was no chariot of fire for swiftness , whatever it might be for pain , to bear her to the `` high countries . ''
Parsing [sent. 9709 len. 24]: He has had nothing to do with our story , save that once he made our Annie feel that she had a home .
Parsing [sent. 9710 len. 22]: And to give that feeling to another is worth living for , and justifies a place in any story like mine .
Parsing [sent. 9711 len. 27]: Auntie Meg 's grief appeared chiefly in her nose ; but it was none the less genuine for that , for her nature was chiefly nose .
Parsing [sent. 9712 len. 20]: She led the way into the death-room - it could hardly be called the sick-room - and Annie followed .
Parsing [sent. 9713 len. 25]: By the bedside sat , in a high-backed chair , an old woman with more wrinkles in her face than moons in her life .
Parsing [sent. 9714 len. 27]: She was perfectly calm , and looked like one , already half-across the river , watching her friend as he passed her towards the opposing bank .
Parsing [sent. 9715 len. 9]: The old man lay with his eyes closed .
Parsing [sent. 9716 len. 29]: As soon as he knew that he was dying he had closed his eyes , that the dead orbs might not stare into the faces of the living .
Parsing [sent. 9717 len. 10]: It had been a whim of his for years .
Parsing [sent. 9718 len. 12]: He would leave the house decent when his lease was up .
Parsing [sent. 9719 len. 18]: And the will kept pressing down the lids which it would soon have no power to lift .
Parsing [sent. 9720 len. 27]: `` Ye 're come in time , '' said Auntie Meg , and whispered to the old woman - `` My brither Jeames 's bairn . ''
Parsing [sent. 9721 len. 22]: `` Ay , ye 're come in time , lassie , '' said the great-aunt kindly , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 9722 len. 21]: The dying man heard the words , opened his eyes , glanced once at Annie , and closed them again .
Parsing [sent. 9723 len. 11]: `` Is that ane o ' the angels come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9724 len. 13]: he asked , for his wits were gone a little way before .
Parsing [sent. 9725 len. 8]: `` Na , weel I wat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9726 len. 6]: said the hard-mouthed ungracious Meg .
Parsing [sent. 9727 len. 12]: `` It 's Annie Anderson , Jeames Anderson 's lass . ''
Parsing [sent. 9728 len. 12]: The old man put his hand feebly from under the bed-clothes .
Parsing [sent. 9729 len. 20]: `` I 'm glad to see ye , dawtie , '' he said , still without opening his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9730 len. 34]: `` I aye wantit to see mair o ' ye , for ye 're jist sic a bairn as I wad hae likit to hae mysel ' gin it had pleased the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 9731 len. 20]: Ye 're a douce , God-fearin ' lassie , and He 'll tak care o ' his ain . ''
Parsing [sent. 9732 len. 8]: Here his mind began to wander again .
Parsing [sent. 9733 len. 21]: `` Marget , '' he said , `` is my een steekit , for I think I see angels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9734 len. 9]: `` Ay are they - close eueuch . ''
Parsing [sent. 9735 len. 8]: `` Weel , that 's verra weel .
Parsing [sent. 9736 len. 8]: I 'll hae a sleep noo . ''
Parsing [sent. 9737 len. 7]: He was silent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 9738 len. 74]: Then he reverted to the fancy that Annie was the first of the angels come to carry away his soul , and murmured brokenly : `` Whan ye tak ' it up , be carefu ' hoo ye han ` le ` t , baith for it 's some weyk , and for it 's no ower clean , and micht blaud the bonnie white han 's o ' sic God-servers as yersels .
Parsing [sent. 9739 len. 32]: I ken mysel there 's ae spot ower the hert o ' ` t , whilk cam o ' an ill word I gied a bairn for stealin ' a neep .
Parsing [sent. 9740 len. 9]: But they did steal a hantle that year .
Parsing [sent. 9741 len. 31]: And there 's anither spot upo ' the richt han ' , whilk cam o ' ower gude a bargain I made wi ' auld John Thamson at Glass fair .
Parsing [sent. 9742 len. 22]: And it wad never come oot wi ' a ' the soap and water - Hoots , I 'm haverin ' !
Parsing [sent. 9743 len. 20]: It 's upo ' the han ' o ' my soul , whaur soap and water can never come .
Parsing [sent. 9744 len. 24]: Lord , dight it clean , and I 'll gie him ' t a ' back whan I see him in thy kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 9745 len. 8]: And I 'll beg his pardon forbye .
Parsing [sent. 9746 len. 9]: But I didna chait him a ` thegither .
Parsing [sent. 9747 len. 15]: I only tuik mair nor I wad hae gi'en for the colt mysel ' .
Parsing [sent. 9748 len. 17]: And min ' ye dinna lat me fa ' , gaein ' throu the lift . ''
Parsing [sent. 9749 len. 36]: He went on thus , with wandering thoughts that in their wildest vagaries were yet tending homeward ; and which when least sound , were yet busy with the wisest of mortal business -- repentance .
Parsing [sent. 9750 len. 20]: By degrees he fell into a slumber , and from that , about midnight , into a deeper sleep .
Parsing [sent. 9751 len. 8]: The next morning , Annie went out .
Parsing [sent. 9752 len. 27]: She could not feel oppressed or sorrowful at such a death , and she would walk up the river to the churchyard where her father lay .
Parsing [sent. 9753 len. 25]: The Wan Water was shallow , and therefore full of talk about all the things that were deep secrets when its bosom was full .
Parsing [sent. 9754 len. 15]: Along great portions of its channel , the dry stones lay like a sea-beach .
Parsing [sent. 9755 len. 15]: They had been swept from the hills in the torrents of its autumnal fury .
Parsing [sent. 9756 len. 13]: The fish did not rise , for the heat made them languid .
Parsing [sent. 9757 len. 11]: No trees sheltered them from the rays of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 9758 len. 26]: Both above and below , the banks were rugged , and the torrent strong ; but at this part the stream flowed through level fields .
Parsing [sent. 9759 len. 38]: Here and there a large piece had cracked off and fallen from the bank , to be swept away in the next flood ; but meantime the grass was growing on it , greener than anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 9760 len. 38]: The corn would come close to the water 's edge and again sweep away to make room for cattle and sheep ; and here and there a field of red clover lay wavering between shadow and shine .
Parsing [sent. 9761 len. 18]: She went up a long way , and then crossing some fields , came to the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 9762 len. 24]: She did not know her father 's grave , for no stone marked the spot where he sank in this broken earthy sea .
Parsing [sent. 9763 len. 11]: There was no church : its memory even had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 9764 len. 36]: It seemed as if the churchyard had swallowed the church as the heavenly light shall one day swallow the sun and the moon ; and the lake of divine fire shall swallow death and hell .
Parsing [sent. 9765 len. 34]: She lingered a little , and then set out on her slow return , often sitting down on the pebbles , sea-worn ages before the young river had begun to play with them .
Parsing [sent. 9766 len. 22]: Resting thus about half way home , she sang a song which she had found in her father 's old song-book .
Parsing [sent. 9767 len. 30]: She had said it once to Alec and Curly , but they did not care much for it , and she had not thought of it again till now .
Parsing [sent. 9768 len. 9]: `` Ane by ane they gang awa ' .
Parsing [sent. 9769 len. 9]: The gatherer gathers great an ' sma ' .
Parsing [sent. 9770 len. 10]: Ane by ane maks ane an ' a ' .
Parsing [sent. 9771 len. 22]: Aye whan ane is ta'en frae ane , Ane on earth is left alane , Twa in heaven are knit again .
Parsing [sent. 9772 len. 23]: Whan God 's hairst is in or lang , Golden-heidit , ripe , and thrang , Syne begins a better sang . ''
Parsing [sent. 9773 len. 17]: She looked up , and Curly was walking through the broad river to where she sat .
Parsing [sent. 9774 len. 14]: `` I kent ye a mile aff , Annie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 9775 len. 11]: `` I 'm glaid to see ye , Curly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9776 len. 19]: `` I wonner gin ye 'll be as glaid to see me the neist time , Annie . ''
Parsing [sent. 9777 len. 10]: Then Annie perceived that Curly looked earnest and anxious .
Parsing [sent. 9778 len. 9]: `` What do ye say , Curly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9779 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 9780 len. 17]: `` I hardly ken what I say , Annie , though I ken what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 9781 len. 20]: And I dinna ken what I 'm gaun to say neist , but they say the trowth will oot .
Parsing [sent. 9782 len. 12]: I wiss it wad , ohn a body said it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9783 len. 10]: `` What can be the maitter , Curly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9784 len. 6]: - Annie was getting frightened .
Parsing [sent. 9785 len. 16]: - `` It maun be ill news , or ye wadna luik like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 9786 len. 18]: `` I doobt it 'll be warst news to them that it 's nae news till . ''
Parsing [sent. 9787 len. 9]: `` Ye speyk in riddles , Curly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9788 len. 26]: He tried to laugh but succeeded badly , and stood before her , with downcast eyes , poking his thorn-stick into the mass of pebbles .
Parsing [sent. 9789 len. 13]: Annie waited in silence , and that brought it out at last .
Parsing [sent. 9790 len. 18]: `` Annie , when we war at the schule thegither , I wad hae gien ye onything .
Parsing [sent. 9791 len. 24]: Noo I hae gien ye a ' thing , and my hert to the beet -LRB- boot -RRB- o ' the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 9792 len. 4]: `` Curly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9793 len. 18]: said Annie , and said no more , for she felt as if her heart would break .
Parsing [sent. 9794 len. 23]: `` I likit ye at the schule , Annie ; but noo there 's naething i ' the warl but you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9795 len. 30]: Annie rose gently , came close to him , and laying a hand on his arm , said , `` I 'm richt sorry for ye , Curly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9796 len. 29]: He half turned his back , was silent for a moment , and then said coldly , but in a trembling voice , `` Dinna distress yersel ' .
Parsing [sent. 9797 len. 6]: We canna help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9798 len. 10]: `` But what 'll ye do , Curly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9799 len. 19]: asked Annie in a tone full of compassionate loving-kindness , and with her hand still on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 9800 len. 8]: `` It 's sair to bide . ''
Parsing [sent. 9801 len. 5]: `` Gude kens that .
Parsing [sent. 9802 len. 13]: - I maun jist warstle throu ' ' t like mony anither .
Parsing [sent. 9803 len. 29]: I 'll awa ' back to the pig-skin saiddle I was workin ' at , '' said Curly , with a smile at the bitterness of his fate .
Parsing [sent. 9804 len. 12]: `` It 's no that I dinna like ye , Curly .
Parsing [sent. 9805 len. 4]: Ye ken that .
Parsing [sent. 9806 len. 11]: I wad do anything for ye that I cud do .
Parsing [sent. 9807 len. 11]: Ye hae been a gude frien ' to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9808 len. 7]: And here Annie burst out crying .
Parsing [sent. 9809 len. 4]: `` Dinna greit .
Parsing [sent. 9810 len. 5]: The Lord preserve 's !
Parsing [sent. 9811 len. 3]: dinna greit .
Parsing [sent. 9812 len. 8]: I winna say anither word aboot it .
Parsing [sent. 9813 len. 14]: What 's Curly that sic a ane as you sud greit for him ?
Parsing [sent. 9814 len. 2]: Faith !
Parsing [sent. 9815 len. 12]: it 's nearhan ' as guid as gin ye lo'ed me .
Parsing [sent. 9816 len. 27]: I 'm as prood 's a turkey-cock , '' averred Curly in a voice ready to break with emotion of a very different sort from pride .
Parsing [sent. 9817 len. 13]: `` It 's a sair thing that things winna gang richt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9818 len. 21]: said Annie at last , after many vain attempts to stop the fountain by drying the stream of her tears .
Parsing [sent. 9819 len. 19]: - I believe they were the first words of complaint upon things in general that she ever uttered .
Parsing [sent. 9820 len. 10]: `` Is ' t my wyte , Curly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9821 len. 3]: she added .
Parsing [sent. 9822 len. 10]: `` Deil a bit o ' ` t ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9823 len. 3]: cried Curly .
Parsing [sent. 9824 len. 10]: `` And I beg yer pardon for sweirin ' .
Parsing [sent. 9825 len. 3]: Your wyte !
Parsing [sent. 9826 len. 6]: I was aye a fule .
Parsing [sent. 9827 len. 33]: But maybe , '' he added , brightening a little , `` I micht hae a chance - some day - some day far awa ' , ye ken , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9828 len. 7]: `` Na , na , Curly .
Parsing [sent. 9829 len. 17]: Dinna think o ' ` t. There 's no chance for ye , dear Curly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9830 len. 8]: His face flushed red as a peony .
Parsing [sent. 9831 len. 14]: `` That lick-the-dirt 's no gaun to gar ye marry the colliginer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9832 len. 17]: `` Dinna ye be feared that I 'll marry onybody I dinna like , Curly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9833 len. 6]: `` Ye dinna like him .
Parsing [sent. 9834 len. 6]: I houp to God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9835 len. 7]: `` I canna bide him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9836 len. 8]: `` Weel , maybe - Wha kens ?
Parsing [sent. 9837 len. 7]: I _ daurna _ despair . ''
Parsing [sent. 9838 len. 21]: `` Curly , Curly , I maun be honest wi ' you , as ye hae been wi ' me .
Parsing [sent. 9839 len. 16]: Whan ance a body 's seen ane , they canna see anither , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 9840 len. 30]: Wha cud hae been at the schule as I was sae lang , and syne taen oot o ' the water , ye ken , and syne - ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9841 len. 3]: Annie stopped .
Parsing [sent. 9842 len. 15]: `` Gin ye mean Alec Forbes - '' said Curly , and stopped too .
Parsing [sent. 9843 len. 28]: But presently he went on again - `` Gin I war to come atween Alec Forbes and you , hangin ' wad be ower gude for me .
Parsing [sent. 9844 len. 12]: But has Alec - '' `` Na , nae a word .
Parsing [sent. 9845 len. 5]: But haud yer tongue .
Parsing [sent. 9846 len. 2]: Curly .
Parsing [sent. 9847 len. 8]: Ance is a ' wi ' me .
Parsing [sent. 9848 len. 16]: - It 's nae mony lasses wad hae tell ' t ye sic a thing .
Parsing [sent. 9849 len. 7]: But I ken it 's richt .
Parsing [sent. 9850 len. 10]: Ye 're the only ane that has my secret .
Parsing [sent. 9851 len. 6]: Keep it , Curly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9852 len. 10]: `` Like Deith himsel ' , '' said Curly .
Parsing [sent. 9853 len. 10]: `` Ye _ are _ a braw lass . ''
Parsing [sent. 9854 len. 11]: `` Ye maunna think ill o ' me , Curly .
Parsing [sent. 9855 len. 10]: I hae tell ' t ye the trowth . ''
Parsing [sent. 9856 len. 16]: `` Jist lat me kiss yer bonnie han ' and I 'll gang content . ''
Parsing [sent. 9857 len. 18]: Wisely done or not , it was truth and tenderness that made her offer her lips instead .
Parsing [sent. 9858 len. 22]: He turned in silence , comforted for the time , though the comfort would evaporate long before the trouble would sink .
Parsing [sent. 9859 len. 4]: `` Curly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9860 len. 8]: cried Annie , and he came back .
Parsing [sent. 9861 len. 16]: `` I think that 's young Robert Bruce been to Clippenstrae to speir efter me .
Parsing [sent. 9862 len. 6]: Dinna lat him come farther .
Parsing [sent. 9863 len. 7]: He 's an unceevil fallow . ''
Parsing [sent. 9864 len. 24]: `` Gin he wins by me , he maun hae mair feathers nor I hae , '' said Curly , and walked on .
Parsing [sent. 9865 len. 4]: Annie followed slowly .
Parsing [sent. 9866 len. 10]: When she saw the men meet she sat down .
Parsing [sent. 9867 len. 9]: Curly spoke first , as he came up .
Parsing [sent. 9868 len. 11]: `` A fine day , Robbie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 9869 len. 12]: Bruce made no reply , for relations had altered since school-days .
Parsing [sent. 9870 len. 30]: It was an evil moment however in which to carry a high chin to Willie Macwha , who was out of temper with the whole world except Annie Anderson .
Parsing [sent. 9871 len. 9]: He strode up to the _ colliginer _ .
Parsing [sent. 9872 len. 13]: `` I said it was a fine day , '' he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 9873 len. 19]: `` Well , I said nothing to the contrary , '' answered Bruce , putting on his English .
Parsing [sent. 9874 len. 28]: `` It 's the custom i ' this country to mak what answer a man has the sense to mak whan he 's spoken till ceevily . ''
Parsing [sent. 9875 len. 7]: `` I considered you uncivil . ''
Parsing [sent. 9876 len. 30]: `` That 's jist what a bonnie lassie sittin ' yonner said aboot you whan she prayed me no to lat you gang a step nearer till her . ''
Parsing [sent. 9877 len. 11]: Curly found it at the moment particularly agreeable to quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 9878 len. 18]: Moreover he had always disliked Bruce , and now hated him because Annie had complained of him .
Parsing [sent. 9879 len. 20]: `` I have as much right to walk here as you or any one else , '' said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 9880 len. 12]: `` Maybe ; but even colliginers doesna aye get their richts .
Parsing [sent. 9881 len. 12]: Ae richt whiles rides upo ' the tap o ' anither .
Parsing [sent. 9882 len. 34]: And Annie Anderson has a richt no to be disturbit , whan her uncle , honest man , 's jist lyin ' waitin ' for 's coffin i ' the hoose yonner . ''
Parsing [sent. 9883 len. 7]: `` I 'm her cousin . ''
Parsing [sent. 9884 len. 15]: `` It 's sma ' comfort ony o ' yer breed ever brocht her .
Parsing [sent. 9885 len. 11]: Cousin or no , ye sanna gang near her . ''
Parsing [sent. 9886 len. 16]: `` I 'll go where I please , '' said Bruce , moving to pass .
Parsing [sent. 9887 len. 8]: Curly moved right in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 9888 len. 7]: `` By me ye shanna gang .
Parsing [sent. 9889 len. 25]: I hae lickit ye afore for bein ' ill till her ; and I will again gin ye gang a step nearer till her .
Parsing [sent. 9890 len. 5]: She doesna want ye .
Parsing [sent. 9891 len. 4]: Faith I will !
Parsing [sent. 9892 len. 9]: But I wad raither no fecht afore her .
Parsing [sent. 9893 len. 21]: Sae jist come back to the toon wi ' me , and we 'll say nae mair aboot it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9894 len. 8]: `` I 'll see you damned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9895 len. 3]: said Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 9896 len. 15]: `` Maybe ye may , bein ' likly to arrive at the spot first .
Parsing [sent. 9897 len. 42]: But i ' the mean time , gin ye dinna want her to see ye lickit , come doon into yon how , and we 'll jist sattle aff han ' wha 's the best man o ' the twa . ''
Parsing [sent. 9898 len. 19]: `` I wo n't move a step to please you or any one else , '' returned Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 9899 len. 13]: He saw that his safety consisted in keeping within sight of Annie .
Parsing [sent. 9900 len. 24]: Curly saw on his part that , a few steps nearer to where Annie sat , the path led behind a stunted ash-tree .
Parsing [sent. 9901 len. 20]: So he stepped aside with the proverb , `` He that will to Coupar , maun to Coupar . ''
Parsing [sent. 9902 len. 22]: Without deigning a word , Bruce walked on , full of pride , concluding that Curly 's heart had failed him .
Parsing [sent. 9903 len. 19]: But the moment he was behind the tree , Curly met him from the other side of it .
Parsing [sent. 9904 len. 24]: Then Bruce 's anger , if not his courage , rose , and with an oath , he pushed against him to pass .
Parsing [sent. 9905 len. 23]: But the sensation he instantly felt in his nose astonished him ; and the blood beginning to flow cowed him at once .
Parsing [sent. 9906 len. 16]: He put his handkerchief to his face , turned , and walked back to Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 9907 len. 36]: Curly followed him at a few yards ' distance , regretting that he had showed the white feather so soon , as , otherwise , he would have had the pleasure of thrashing him properly .
Parsing [sent. 9908 len. 19]: He saw him safe in at the back-door , and then went to his own father 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 9909 len. 15]: After a short greeting , very short on Curly 's part , `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 9910 len. 14]: Willie , '' said his father , `` what 's come ower ye ?
Parsing [sent. 9911 len. 15]: Ye luik as gin some lass had said _ na _ to ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 9912 len. 20]: `` Some lasses ' _ no _ 's better not ither lasses ' _ ay _ , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 9913 len. 26]: `` Deed mnybe , laddie , '' said George ; adding to himself , `` That maun hae been Annie Anderson - nae ither . ''
Parsing [sent. 9914 len. 18]: He was particularly attentive and yielding to Willie during his short visit , and Willie understood it .
Parsing [sent. 9915 len. 51]: Had Annie been compelled , by any evil chance , to return to the garret over Robert Bruce 's shop , she would not indeed have found the holes in the floor and the roof reopened ; but she would have found that the carpet and the curtains were gone .
Parsing [sent. 9916 len. 16]: The report went through Glamerton that she and Willie Macwha were _ coortin ' _ .
Parsing [sent. 9917 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 9918 len. 21]: Thomas Crann 's conversation with Mr Cupples deepened both his annoyance and his grief at the membership of Robert Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 9919 len. 28]: What was the use of a church if such men as he got into it , and , having got in , could not be got out ?
Parsing [sent. 9920 len. 55]: Had he been guilty of any open _ fault _ , such as getting drunk , for one solitary and accidental instance of which they had excluded one of their best and purest-minded men , they could have got rid of him with comparative ease ; but who so free of fault as Bruce ?
Parsing [sent. 9921 len. 41]: True , he was guilty of the crime of over-reaching whenever he had a chance , and of cheating when there was no risk of being found out - at least so everybody believed - but he had no faults .
Parsing [sent. 9922 len. 46]: The duty , therefore , that lay upon every member , next to the cleanness of his own garments - that of keeping the church pure and unspotted - was hard to fulfil , and no one was ready to undertake it but Thomas Crann .
Parsing [sent. 9923 len. 7]: For what a spot was here !
Parsing [sent. 9924 len. 8]: And Thomas knew his Lord 's will .
Parsing [sent. 9925 len. 24]: Neither was the duty so unpleasant to Thomas 's oppositive nature , as it would have been to a man of easier temperament .
Parsing [sent. 9926 len. 15]: `` Jeames Johnstone , '' he said , `` the kirk maks nae progress .
Parsing [sent. 9927 len. 23]: It 's no as i ' the time o ' the apostles whan the saved war added till ' t daily . ''
Parsing [sent. 9928 len. 41]: `` Weel , ye see , '' returned James , `` that wasna _ oor _ kirk exacly ; and it wasna Mr Turnbull that was the heid o ' ` t. '' `` It 's a ' the same .
Parsing [sent. 9929 len. 6]: The prenciple 's the same .
Parsing [sent. 9930 len. 19]: An ' Mr Turnbull preaches the same gospel Peter and Paul praiched , and wi ' unction too .
Parsing [sent. 9931 len. 26]: And yet here 's the congregation dwin ` lin ' awa ' , and the church itsel ' like naething but bees efter the brunstane .
Parsing [sent. 9932 len. 47]: _ I _ say there 's an Ahchan i ' the camp - a Jonah i ' the vessel - a son o ' Saul i ' the kingdom o ' Dawvid - a Judas amo ' the twal ' - a - '' `` Hoots !
Parsing [sent. 9933 len. 28]: Thomas Crann ; ye 're no pittin ' a ' thae gran ' names upo ' that puir feckless body , Rob Bruce , are ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9934 len. 23]: `` He 's nane feckless for the deevil 's wark or for his ain , which is ae thing and the same .
Parsing [sent. 9935 len. 26]: Oot he maun gang , gin we tak ' him by the scruff o ' the neck and the doup o ' the breeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 9936 len. 28]: `` Dinna jeist , Thomas , aboot sic a dangerous thing , '' said James , mildly glad of one solitary opportunity of rebuking the granite-minded mason .
Parsing [sent. 9937 len. 3]: `` Jeist !
Parsing [sent. 9938 len. 8]: I 'm far eneuch frae jeistin ' .
Parsing [sent. 9939 len. 12]: Ye dinna ken fervour frae jokin ' , Jeames Johnstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 9940 len. 34]: `` He micht tak ' the law upo 's for defamin ' o ' 's character ; and that wad be an awfu ' thing for puir fowk like us , Thamas . ''
Parsing [sent. 9941 len. 10]: `` Aye the same thing ower again , Jeames !
Parsing [sent. 9942 len. 15]: Shy at a stane , and fa ' into the stank -LRB- ditch -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 9943 len. 16]: That 's the pairt o ' a colt and no o ' a Christian . ''
Parsing [sent. 9944 len. 12]: `` But arena we tellt to be wise as serpents ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9945 len. 19]: `` Ye wad tak ' a heap o ' tellin ' upo ' that heid , Jeames . ''
Parsing [sent. 9946 len. 7]: `` Ow , ` deed ay !
Parsing [sent. 9947 len. 9]: And I 'm no my lane , Thamas .
Parsing [sent. 9948 len. 9]: But we _ are _ tellt that . ''
Parsing [sent. 9949 len. 22]: `` The serpent turned oot an ill cooncellor upon ae occasion ower well to be remembert by Adam 's race . ''
Parsing [sent. 9950 len. 13]: `` The words stan ' as I say , '' persisted James .
Parsing [sent. 9951 len. 14]: `` Ye 're no to mak ' the serpent yer cooncellor , man .
Parsing [sent. 9952 len. 21]: But ance ye ken yer duty , ye may weel tak example by him hoo to carry ' t oot .
Parsing [sent. 9953 len. 27]: Did ye ever see an edder lyin ' ower a stane as gin he was naething but a stick himsel ' , bidin ' 's time ?
Parsing [sent. 9954 len. 11]: That 's me , i ' the Scriptur ' sense .
Parsing [sent. 9955 len. 10]: I 'm only bidin ' till I see hoo .
Parsing [sent. 9956 len. 13]: A body maunna do ill that gude may come , though wow !
Parsing [sent. 9957 len. 23]: it 's a sair temptation whiles ; neither maun a body neglec to do richt for fear that ill may follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 9958 len. 6]: `` Ay , true that .
Parsing [sent. 9959 len. 11]: But ye needna burn the hoose to rid the rottans .
Parsing [sent. 9960 len. 29]: I doot ye 'll get 's a ' into ower het water ; and a body needna tak ' the skin aff for the sake o ' cleanliness .
Parsing [sent. 9961 len. 18]: Jist tak ye tent -LRB- care , attention -RRB- , Thamas , what ye 're aboot . ''
Parsing [sent. 9962 len. 49]: Having thus persisted in opposing Thomas to a degree he had never dared before , James took his departure , pursued by the words : `` Tak ye care , Jeames , that in savin ' the richt han ' ye dinna send the haill body to hell .
Parsing [sent. 9963 len. 6]: It was aye yer danger .
Parsing [sent. 9964 len. 10]: I never got bauld coonsel frae ye yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 9965 len. 40]: `` There 's mair vertues i ' the Bible nor courage , Thamas , '' retorted James , holding the outer door open to throw the sentence in , and shutting it instantly to escape with the last word .
Parsing [sent. 9966 len. 13]: Thomas , abandoned to his own resources , meditated long and painfully .
Parsing [sent. 9967 len. 17]: But all he could arrive at was the resolution to have another talk with Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 9968 len. 30]: He might not be a Christian man , but he was an honest and trustworthy man , and might be able from his scholarship to give him some counsel .
Parsing [sent. 9969 len. 18]: So he walked to Howglen the next day , and found him with Alec in the harvest-field .
Parsing [sent. 9970 len. 21]: And Alec 's reception of Thomas showed what a fine thing illness is for bringing people to their right minds .
Parsing [sent. 9971 len. 22]: Mr Cupples walked aside with Thomas , and they seated themselves on two golden sheaves at the foot of a stook .
Parsing [sent. 9972 len. 30]: `` What ye said to me the ither day , sir , '' began Thomas , `` has stucken fest i ' my crap , ever sin ' syne .
Parsing [sent. 9973 len. 7]: We maun hae him oot . ''
Parsing [sent. 9974 len. 11]: `` Na , na ; ye better lat him sit .
Parsing [sent. 9975 len. 7]: He 'll haud doon yer pride .
Parsing [sent. 9976 len. 17]: That man 's a judgment on ye for wantin ' to be better nor yer neebors .
Parsing [sent. 9977 len. 9]: Dinna try to win free o ' judgment .
Parsing [sent. 9978 len. 18]: But I 'll tell ye what I wad hae ye do : Mak muckle o ' 'm .
Parsing [sent. 9979 len. 5]: Gie him tether eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 9980 len. 13]: He 'll gang frae ill to waur , ye may depen ' .
Parsing [sent. 9981 len. 10]: He 'll steal or a ' be dune . ''
Parsing [sent. 9982 len. 29]: `` To the best o ' my belief , sir , that 's no to come , He 's stolen already , or I 'm sair mista'en . ''
Parsing [sent. 9983 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 9984 len. 5]: Can ye pruv that ?
Parsing [sent. 9985 len. 14]: That 's anither maitter , '' returned Cupples , beginning to be interested .
Parsing [sent. 9986 len. 33]: `` I dinna ken whether I oucht to hae mentioned it to ane that wasna a member , though ; but it jist cam oot o ' ` tsel ' like . ''
Parsing [sent. 9987 len. 61]: `` Sae the fac ' that a man 's a member wha 's warst crime may be that he is a member , maks him sic precious gear that he maunna be meddlet wi ' i ' the presence o ' an honest man , wha , thank God , has neither pairt nor lot in ony sic maitter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9988 len. 8]: `` Dinna be angry , Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 9989 len. 23]: I 'll tell ye a ' aboot it , '' pleaded Thomas , than who no man could better recognize good sense .
Parsing [sent. 9990 len. 37]: But the Cosmo Cupples who thus attracted the confidence of Thomas Crann was a very different man from the Cosmo Cupples whom first Alec Forbes went to the garret to see at his landlady 's suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 9991 len. 21]: All the flabbiness had passed from his face , and his eyes shone clearer than ever from a clear complexion .
Parsing [sent. 9992 len. 44]: His mouth still gave a first impression of unsteadiness ; no longer , however , from the formlessness of the loose lips , but from the continual flickering of a nascent smile that rippled their outline with long wavy motions of evanescent humour .
Parsing [sent. 9993 len. 22]: His dress was still careless , but no longer neglected , and his hand was as steady as a rifleman 's .
Parsing [sent. 9994 len. 57]: Nor had he found it so hard to conquer his fearful habit as even he had expected ; for with every week passed in bitter abstinence , some new well would break from the rich soil of his intellect , and irrigate with its sweet waters the parched border land between his physical and psychical being .
Parsing [sent. 9995 len. 27]: And when he had once again betaken himself to the forsaken pen , there was little reason to fear a relapse or doubt a final victory .
Parsing [sent. 9996 len. 29]: A playful humanity radiated from him , the result of that powerfullest of all restoratives - _ giving _ of what one has to him who has not .
Parsing [sent. 9997 len. 8]: Indeed his reformation had begun with this .
Parsing [sent. 9998 len. 40]: St Paul taught a thief to labour , that he might have to give : Love taught Mr Cupples to deny himself that he might rescue his friend ; and presently he had found his feet touching the rock .
Parsing [sent. 9999 len. 35]: If he had not yet learned to look `` straight up to heaven , '' his eyes wandered not unfrequently towards that spiritual horizon upon which things earthly and things heavenly meet and embrace .
Parsing [sent. 10000 len. 19]: To such a Cosmo Cupples , then , Thomas told the story of Annie Anderson 's five-pound note .
Parsing [sent. 10001 len. 17]: As he spoke , Cupples was tormented as with the flitting phantom of a half-forgotten dream .
Parsing [sent. 10002 len. 9]: All at once , light flashed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 10003 len. 10]: `` And sae what am I to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10004 len. 8]: asked Thomas as he finished his tale .
Parsing [sent. 10005 len. 39]: - `` I can pruv naething ; but I 'm certain i ' my ain min ' , kennin ' the man 's nater , that it was that note he tuik oot o ' the Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 10006 len. 26]: `` I 'll put the proof o ' that same into yer han 's , or I 'm sair mista'en , '' said Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 10007 len. 7]: `` You , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10008 len. 8]: `` Ay , me , Mr Crann .
Parsing [sent. 10009 len. 15]: But maybe ye wadna tak proof frae sic a sinner against sic a sanct .
Parsing [sent. 10010 len. 13]: Sae ye may keep yer sanct i ' yer holy boasom . ''
Parsing [sent. 10011 len. 10]: `` Dinna gang on that gait , Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 10012 len. 21]: Gin ye can direc ' me to the purification o ' our wee bit temple , I 'll hearken heumbly .
Parsing [sent. 10013 len. 11]: I only wiss ye war ane o ' us . ''
Parsing [sent. 10014 len. 16]: `` I 'll bide till ye hae gotten rid o ' Bruce , ony gait .
Parsing [sent. 10015 len. 11]: - I care naething for yer sma ' separatist kirkies .
Parsing [sent. 10016 len. 24]: - I wonner ye dinna pray for a clippin ' o ' an auld sun that ye micht do withoot the common daylicht .
Parsing [sent. 10017 len. 36]: But I do think it 's a great shame - that sic a sneak sud be i ' the company o ' honest fowk , as I tak the maist o ' ye to be .
Parsing [sent. 10018 len. 7]: Sae I 'll do my best .
Parsing [sent. 10019 len. 12]: Ye 'll hear frae me in a day or twa . ''
Parsing [sent. 10020 len. 27]: Cupples had remembered the inscription on the fly-leaf of the big Bible , which , according to Thomas Crann , Mr Cowie had given to Annie .
Parsing [sent. 10021 len. 7]: He now went to James Dow .
Parsing [sent. 10022 len. 18]: `` Did Annie ever tell ye aboot a Bible that Mr Cowie ga'e her , Jeames ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10023 len. 5]: `` Ay did she .
Parsing [sent. 10024 len. 8]: I min ' ' t fine . ''
Parsing [sent. 10025 len. 14]: `` Cud ye get a haud o ' ` t. '' `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 10026 len. 4]: I dinna ken .
Parsing [sent. 10027 len. 37]: The crater has laid his ain cleuks upo ' ` t. It 's a sod pity that Annie 's oot o ' the hoose , or she micht hae stow n't -LRB- stolen it -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 10028 len. 11]: `` Truly , bein ' her ain , she micht .
Parsing [sent. 10029 len. 17]: But ye 're a kin ' o ' a guairdian till her - arena ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10030 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 10031 len. 2]: ay .
Parsing [sent. 10032 len. 23]: I hae made mysel ' that in a way ; but Bruce wad aye be luikit upon as the proper guairdian . ''
Parsing [sent. 10033 len. 11]: `` Hae ye ony haud upo ' the siller ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10034 len. 13]: `` I gart him sign a lawyer 's paper aboot it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10035 len. 22]: `` Weel , ye jist gang and demand the Bible , alang wi ' the lave o ' Annie 's property .
Parsing [sent. 10036 len. 24]: Ye ken she 's had trouble aboot her kist -LRB- chest -RRB- , and canna get it frae the swallowin ' cratur ' .
Parsing [sent. 10037 len. 20]: And gin he maks ony demur , jist drap a hint o ' gaein to the lawyer aboot it .
Parsing [sent. 10038 len. 17]: The like o ' him 's as fleyt at a lawyer as cats at cauld water .
Parsing [sent. 10039 len. 6]: Get the Bible we maun .
Parsing [sent. 10040 len. 11]: And ye maun fess ' t to me direckly . ''
Parsing [sent. 10041 len. 14]: Dow was a peaceable man , and did not much relish the commission .
Parsing [sent. 10042 len. 14]: Cupples , thinking he too was a missionar , told him the story .
Parsing [sent. 10043 len. 13]: `` Weel , '' said Dow , `` lat him sit there .
Parsing [sent. 10044 len. 11]: Maybe they 'll haud him frae doin ' mair mischeef .
Parsing [sent. 10045 len. 11]: Whan ye jabble a stank , the stink rises . ''
Parsing [sent. 10046 len. 10]: `` I thocht ye was ane o ' them .
Parsing [sent. 10047 len. 7]: Ye maunna lat it oot . ''
Parsing [sent. 10048 len. 5]: `` Na , na .

Parsing [sent. 10050 len. 8]: _ I _ care naething aboot it .
Parsing [sent. 10051 len. 12]: But there 's Thamas Crann jist eatin ' his ain hert .
Parsing [sent. 10052 len. 16]: It 's a sin to lat sic a man live in sic distress . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 10053 len. 12]: ` Deed is ` t. He 's a gude man that .
Parsing [sent. 10054 len. 22]: And he 's been verra kin ' to oor Annie , Mr Cupples , - I 'll do as ye say .
Parsing [sent. 10055 len. 7]: Whan do ye want it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10056 len. 6]: `` This verra nicht . ''
Parsing [sent. 10057 len. 37]: So after his day 's work , which was hard enough at this season of the year , was over , James Dow put on his blue Sunday coat , and set off to the town .
Parsing [sent. 10058 len. 25]: He found Robert Bruce chaffering with a country girl over some butter , for which he wanted to give her less than the market-value .
Parsing [sent. 10059 len. 17]: This roused his indignation , and put him in a much fitter mood for an altercation .
Parsing [sent. 10060 len. 9]: `` I winna gie ye mair nor fivepence .
Parsing [sent. 10061 len. 9]: Hoo are ye the day , Mr Doo ?
Parsing [sent. 10062 len. 10]: I tell ye it has a goo -LRB- Fren .
Parsing [sent. 10063 len. 11]: go t -RRB- o ' neeps or something waur . ''
Parsing [sent. 10064 len. 36]: `` Hoo can that be , Mr Bruce , at this sizzon o ' the year , whan there 's plenty o ' gerss for man an ' beast an ' a ' cratur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10065 len. 4]: said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 10066 len. 13]: `` It 's no for me to say hoo it can be .
Parsing [sent. 10067 len. 6]: That 's no my business .
Parsing [sent. 10068 len. 6]: Noo , Mr Doo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10069 len. 21]: Bruce , whose very life lay in driving bargains , had a great dislike to any interruption of the process .
Parsing [sent. 10070 len. 22]: Yet he forsook the girl as if he had said all he had to say , and turned to James Dow .
Parsing [sent. 10071 len. 34]: For he wanted to get rid of him before concluding his bargain with the girl , whose butter he was determined to have even if he must pay her own price for it .
Parsing [sent. 10072 len. 56]: Like the Reeve in the Canterbury Tales , who `` ever rode the hinderest of the rout , '' being such a rogue and such a rogue-catcher that he could not bear anybody behind his back , Bruce , when about the business that his soul loved , eschewed the presence of any third person .
Parsing [sent. 10073 len. 7]: `` Noo , Mr Doo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10074 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 10075 len. 10]: `` My business 'll keep , '' replied Dow .
Parsing [sent. 10076 len. 14]: `` But ye see we 're busy the nicht , Mr Doo . ''
Parsing [sent. 10077 len. 10]: `` Weel , I dinna want to hurry ye .
Parsing [sent. 10078 len. 22]: But I wonner that ye wad buy ill butter , to please onybody , even a bonnie lass like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 10079 len. 22]: `` Some fowk likes the taste o ' neeps , though I dinna like it mysel ' , '' answered Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 10080 len. 29]: `` But the fac ' that neeps is no a favourite wi ' the maist o ' fowk , brings doon the price i ' the market . ''
Parsing [sent. 10081 len. 27]: `` Neeps is neither here nor there , '' said the girl ; and taking up her basket , she was going to leave the shop .
Parsing [sent. 10082 len. 12]: `` Bide a bit , my lass , '' cried Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 10083 len. 9]: `` The mistress wad like to see ye .
Parsing [sent. 10084 len. 22]: Jist gang benn the hoose to her wi ' yer basket , and see what she thinks o ' the butter .
Parsing [sent. 10085 len. 9]: I may be wrang , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 10086 len. 17]: So saying he opened the inner door , and ushered the young woman into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 10087 len. 7]: `` Noo , Mr Doo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10088 len. 5]: he said once more .
Parsing [sent. 10089 len. 19]: `` Is ' t tobawco , or sneeshin -LRB- snuff -RRB- , or what is ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10090 len. 14]: `` It 's Annie Anderson 's kist and a ' her gear . ''
Parsing [sent. 10091 len. 10]: `` I 'm surprised at ye , Jeames Doo .
Parsing [sent. 10092 len. 25]: There 's the lassie 's room up the stair , fit for ony princess , whanever she likes to come back till ` t .
Parsing [sent. 10093 len. 18]: But she was aye a royt -LRB- riotous -RRB- lassie , an ' a reglar rintheroot . ''
Parsing [sent. 10094 len. 17]: `` Ye lee , Rob Bruce , '' exclaimed Dow , surprised out of his proprieties .
Parsing [sent. 10095 len. 15]: `` Whaever ye say that till , dinna say ' t to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 10096 len. 13]: Bruce was anything but a quarrelsome man with other than his inferiors .
Parsing [sent. 10097 len. 7]: He pocketed the lie very calmly .
Parsing [sent. 10098 len. 9]: `` Dinna lowse yer temper , Mr Doo .
Parsing [sent. 10099 len. 10]: It 's a sair fau ' t that . ''
Parsing [sent. 10100 len. 22]: `` Jist ye deliver up the bairn 's effecks , or I 'll gang to them that 'll gar ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 10101 len. 10]: `` Wha micht that be , Mr Doo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10102 len. 16]: asked Bruce , wishing first to find out how far Dow was prepared to go .
Parsing [sent. 10103 len. 26]: `` Ye hae no richt whatever to keep that lassie 's claes , as gin she aucht -LRB- owed -RRB- you onything for rent . ''
Parsing [sent. 10104 len. 13]: `` Hae _ ye _ ony richt to tak them awa ' ?
Parsing [sent. 10105 len. 11]: Hoo ken I what 'll come o ' them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10106 len. 23]: `` Weel , I s ' awa ' doon to Mr Gibb , and we 'll see what can be dune there .
Parsing [sent. 10107 len. 67]: It 's weel kent ower a ' Glamerton , Mr Bruce , in what mainner you and yer haill hoose hae borne yersels to that orphan lassie ; and I 'll gang into ilka chop , as I gang doon the street , that is , whaur I 'm acquant , and I 'll jist tell them whaur I 'm gaun , and what for . ''
Parsing [sent. 10108 len. 12]: The thing which beyond all others Bruce dreaded was unremunerative notoriety .
Parsing [sent. 10109 len. 3]: `` Hoots !
Parsing [sent. 10110 len. 12]: Jeames Doo , ye dinna ken jokin ' frae jeistin ' .
Parsing [sent. 10111 len. 18]: I never was the man to set mysel ' i ' the face o ' onything rizzonable .
Parsing [sent. 10112 len. 36]: But ye see it wad be cast up to the haill o ' 's that we had driven the puir lassie oot o ' the hoose , and syne flung her things efter her . ''
Parsing [sent. 10113 len. 7]: `` The tane ye hae dune .
Parsing [sent. 10114 len. 12]: The tither ye shanna do , for I 'll tak them .
Parsing [sent. 10115 len. 17]: And I 'll tell ye what fowk 'll say gin ye dinna gie up the things .
Parsing [sent. 10116 len. 16]: They 'll say that ye baith drave her awa ' and keepit her bit duds .
Parsing [sent. 10117 len. 13]: I 'll see to that - _ and mair forbye _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 10118 len. 10]: Bruce understood that he referred to Annie 's money .
Parsing [sent. 10119 len. 69]: His object in refusing to give up her box had been to retain as long as possible a chance of persuading her to return to his house ; for should she leave it finally , her friends might demand the interest in money , which at present he was bound to pay only in aliment and shelter , little of either of which she required at his hands .
Parsing [sent. 10120 len. 8]: But here was a greater danger still .
Parsing [sent. 10121 len. 30]: `` Mother , '' he cried , `` pit up Miss Anderson 's claes in her box to gang wi ' the carrier the morn 's mornin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 10122 len. 14]: `` I 'll tak them wi ' me , '' said Dow resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 10123 len. 4]: `` Ye canna .
Parsing [sent. 10124 len. 6]: Ye haena a cairt . ''
Parsing [sent. 10125 len. 22]: `` Ye get them pitten up , and I 'll fess a barrow , '' said James , leaving the shop .
Parsing [sent. 10126 len. 19]: He borrowed a wheelbarrow from Thomas Crann , and found the box ready for him when he returned .
Parsing [sent. 10127 len. 24]: The moment he lifted it , he was certain from the weight of the poor little property that the Bible was not there .
Parsing [sent. 10128 len. 11]: `` Ye haena pitten in Mr Cooie 's Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 10129 len. 3]: `` Mother !
Parsing [sent. 10130 len. 8]: did ye pit in the Bible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10131 len. 10]: cried Bruce , for the house-door was open . ''
Parsing [sent. 10132 len. 6]: ` Deed no , father .
Parsing [sent. 10133 len. 20]: It 's better whaur ' t is , '' said Mrs Bruce from the kitchen , with shrill response .
Parsing [sent. 10134 len. 22]: `` Ye see , Mr Doo , the Bible 's lain sae lang there , that it 's jist oor ain .
Parsing [sent. 10135 len. 17]: And the lassie canna want it till she has a faimily to hae worship wi ' .
Parsing [sent. 10136 len. 13]: And syne she s ' be welcome to tak ' it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10137 len. 18]: `` Ye gang up the stair for the buik , or I 'll gang mysel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 10138 len. 31]: Bruce went and fetched it , with a bad grace enough , and handed over with it the last tattered remnants of his respectability into the hands of James Dow .
Parsing [sent. 10139 len. 17]: Mr Cupples , having made a translation of the inscription , took it to Thomas Crann .
Parsing [sent. 10140 len. 23]: `` Do ye min ' what Bruce read that nicht ye saw him tak ' something oot o ' the beuk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10141 len. 6]: he asked as he entered .
Parsing [sent. 10142 len. 6]: `` Ay , weel that .
Parsing [sent. 10143 len. 16]: He began wi ' the twenty-third psalm , and gaed on to the neist . ''
Parsing [sent. 10144 len. 6]: `` Weel , read that .
Parsing [sent. 10145 len. 15]: I faun ' ' t on a blank leaf o ' the buik . ''
Parsing [sent. 10146 len. 47]: Thomas read - ' _ Over the twenty-third psalm of David I have laid a five-pound note for my dear Annie Anderson , after my death _ , ' - and lifting his eyes , stared at Mr Cupples , his face slowly brightening with satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 10147 len. 16]: Then a cloud came over his brow - for was he not rejoicing in iniquity ?
Parsing [sent. 10148 len. 9]: At least he was rejoicing in coming shame .
Parsing [sent. 10149 len. 41]: `` Hoo cud it hae been , '' he asked after a brief pause , `` that Bruce didna fa ' upo ' this , as weel 's you , Mr Cupples , or didna scart it oot ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 10150 len. 7]: 'Cause 't was written in Latin .
Parsing [sent. 10151 len. 14]: The body hadna the wit to misdoobt the contents o ' ` t .
Parsing [sent. 10152 len. 22]: It said naething _ till _ him , and he never thoucht it cud say onything _ aboot _ him . ''
Parsing [sent. 10153 len. 15]: `` It 's a fine thing to be a scholar , Mr Cupples . ''
Parsing [sent. 10154 len. 6]: `` Ay , whiles . ''
Parsing [sent. 10155 len. 11]: `` They say the Miss Cowies are great scholars . ''
Parsing [sent. 10156 len. 4]: `` Verra likly .
Parsing [sent. 10157 len. 14]: - But there 's ae thing mair I wad put ye up till .
Parsing [sent. 10158 len. 22]: Can ye tell the day o ' the month that ye gaed hame wi ' yer prayin ' frien ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10159 len. 18]: `` It was the nicht o ' a special prayer-meetin ' for the state o ' Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 10160 len. 11]: I can fin ' oot the date frae the kirk-buiks .
Parsing [sent. 10161 len. 18]: What am I to do wi ' ' t whan I hae ` t , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10162 len. 43]: `` Gang to the bank the body deals wi ' , and spier whether a note beirin ' the nummer o ' thae figures was paid intil ' t upo ' the Monday followin ' that Sunday , and wha paid it .
Parsing [sent. 10163 len. 9]: They 'll tell ye that at ance . ''
Parsing [sent. 10164 len. 26]: But for various reasons , which it is needless to give in this history , Thomas was compelled to postpone the execution of his project .
Parsing [sent. 10165 len. 22]: And Robert went on buying and selling and getting gain , all unaware of the pit he had digged for himself .
Parsing [sent. 10166 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 10167 len. 12]: One Sunday morning Mr Cupples was returning from church with Alec .
Parsing [sent. 10168 len. 12]: `` Ye likit the sermon the day , Mr Cupples . ''
Parsing [sent. 10169 len. 8]: `` What gars ye think that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10170 len. 13]: `` I saw ye takin ' notes a ' the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 10171 len. 5]: `` Gleg-eed mole ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10172 len. 4]: said Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 10173 len. 12]: `` Luik at the notes as ye ca ' them . ''
Parsing [sent. 10174 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 10175 len. 6]: it 's a sang ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10176 len. 5]: exclaimed Alec with delight .
Parsing [sent. 10177 len. 11]: `` What cud gar ye think I likit sic havers ?
Parsing [sent. 10178 len. 10]: The crater was preachin ' till 's ain shaidow .
Parsing [sent. 10179 len. 30]: And he pat me into sic an unchristian temper o ' dislike to him and a ' the concern , that I ran to my city o ' refuge .
Parsing [sent. 10180 len. 14]: I never gang to the kirk wi'oot it - I mean my pocket-buik .
Parsing [sent. 10181 len. 26]: And I tried to gie birth till a sang , the quhilk , like Jove , I conceived i ' my heid last nicht . ''
Parsing [sent. 10182 len. 13]: `` Lat me luik at it , '' said Alec , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 10183 len. 20]: `` Na , ye wadna mak ' either rhyme or rizzon o ' ' t as it stan 's .
Parsing [sent. 10184 len. 8]: I 'll read it to ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 10185 len. 18]: `` Come and sit doon , than , on the ither side o ' the dyke . ''
Parsing [sent. 10186 len. 31]: A dyke in Scotland is an earthen fence - to my prejudiced mind , the ideal of fences ; because , for one thing , it never keeps anybody out .
Parsing [sent. 10187 len. 91]: And not to speak of the wild bees ' bykes in them , with their inexpressible honey , like that of Mount Hymettus - to the recollection of the man , at least - they are covered with grass , and wild flowers grow all about them , through which the wind harps and carps over your head , filling your sense with the odours of a little modest yellow tufty flower , for which I never heard a name in Scotland : the English call it Ladies ' Bedstraw .
Parsing [sent. 10188 len. 12]: They got over the dyke into the field and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 10189 len. 18]: `` Ye see it 's no lickit eneuch yet , '' said Mr Cupples , and began .
Parsing [sent. 10190 len. 8]: `` O lassie , ayont the hill !

Parsing [sent. 10214 len. 10]: `` Isna it raither metapheesical , Mr Cupples ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10215 len. 3]: asked Alec .
Parsing [sent. 10216 len. 6]: `` Ay is ` t .
Parsing [sent. 10217 len. 5]: But fowk 's metapheesical .
Parsing [sent. 10218 len. 8]: True , they dinna aye ke n't .

Parsing [sent. 10220 len. 14]: Hit and me jist stan 's an ' girns at ane anither . ''
Parsing [sent. 10221 len. 19]: `` It 'll tak a heap o ' Christianity to lay _ that _ ghaist , Mr Cupples .

Parsing [sent. 10223 len. 12]: The lassie wadna be able to do ' t for ye .
Parsing [sent. 10224 len. 15]: It 's ower muckle to expec ' o ' her or ony mortal woman .

Parsing [sent. 10226 len. 23]: And till the Holy Ghost comes intil 's ain hoose , the ghaist that ye speak o ' winna gang oot . ''
Parsing [sent. 10227 len. 10]: A huge form towered above the dyke behind them .
Parsing [sent. 10228 len. 16]: `` Ye had no richt to hearken , Thomas Crann , '' said Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 10229 len. 18]: `` I beg your pardon , '' returned Thomas ; `` I never thoucht o ' that .
Parsing [sent. 10230 len. 13]: The soun ' was sae bonnie , I jist stud and hearkened .
Parsing [sent. 10231 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 10232 len. 14]: - But that 's no the richt thing for the Sawbath day . ''
Parsing [sent. 10233 len. 17]: `` But ye 're haein ' a walk yersel ' , it seems , Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 10234 len. 14]: `` Ay ; but I 'm gaun ower the hills to my school .
Parsing [sent. 10235 len. 24]: An ' I maunna bide to claver wi ' ye , for I hae a guid twa hoors ' traivel afore me . ''
Parsing [sent. 10236 len. 27]: `` Come hame wi ' us , and hae a mou ` fu ' o ' denner afore ye gang , Thomas , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 10237 len. 7]: `` Na , I thank ye .
Parsing [sent. 10238 len. 14]: It does the sowl gude to fast a wee ae day in saiven .
Parsing [sent. 10239 len. 14]: I had a piece , though , afore I cam ' awa ' .
Parsing [sent. 10240 len. 8]: What am I braggin ' o ' !
Parsing [sent. 10241 len. 6]: Gude day to ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 10242 len. 13]: `` That 's an honest man , Alec , '' said Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 10243 len. 8]: `` He is , '' returned Alec .
Parsing [sent. 10244 len. 12]: `` But he never will do as other people do . ''
Parsing [sent. 10245 len. 23]: `` Perhaps that 's the source of his honesty - that he walks by an inward light , '' said Cupples thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 10246 len. 5]: The year wore on .
Parsing [sent. 10247 len. 4]: Alec grew confident .
Parsing [sent. 10248 len. 8]: They returned together to their old quarters .
Parsing [sent. 10249 len. 16]: Alec passed his examinations triumphantly , and continued his studies with greater vigour than before .
Parsing [sent. 10250 len. 39]: Especially he walked the hospitals with much attention and interest , ever warned by Cupples to beware lest he should come to regard a man as a physical machine , and so grow a mere doctoring machine himself .
Parsing [sent. 10251 len. 6]: Mr Fraser declined seeing him .
Parsing [sent. 10252 len. 15]: The old man was in a pitiable condition , and indeed never lectured again .
Parsing [sent. 10253 len. 12]: Alec no more frequented his old dismal haunt by the seashore .
Parsing [sent. 10254 len. 83]: The cry of the drowning girl would not have come to him as it would to the more finely nervous constitution of Mr Cupples ; but the cry of a sea-gull , or the wash of the waves , or even the wind across the tops of the sand-hills , would have been enough to make him see in every crest which the wind tore white in the gloamin , the forlorn figure of the girl he loved vanishing from his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10255 len. 45]: The more heartily he worked the more did the evil as well as the painful portions of his history recede into the background of his memory , growing more and more like the traces left by a bad , turbid , and sorrowful dream .
Parsing [sent. 10256 len. 42]: Is it true that _ all _ our experiences will one day revive in entire clearness of outline and full brilliancy of colour , passing before the horror-struck soul to the denial of time , and the assertion of ever-present eternity ?
Parsing [sent. 10257 len. 15]: If so , then God be with us , for we shall need him .
Parsing [sent. 10258 len. 15]: Annie Anderson 's great-aunt took to her bed directly after her husband 's funeral .
Parsing [sent. 10259 len. 18]: Finding there was much to do about the place , Annie felt no delicacy as to remaining .
Parsing [sent. 10260 len. 24]: She worked harder than ever she had worked before , blistered her hands , and browned her fair face and neck altogether autumnally .
Parsing [sent. 10261 len. 91]: Her aunt and she together shore -LRB- reaped -RRB- the little field of oats ; got the sheaves home and made a rick of them ; dug up the potatoes , and covered them in a pit with a blanket of earth ; looked after the one cow and calf which gathered the grass along the road and river sides ; fed the pigs and the poultry , and even went with a neighbour and his cart to the moss , to howk -LRB- dig -RRB- their winter-store of peats .
Parsing [sent. 10262 len. 16]: But this they found too hard for them , and were forced to give up .
Parsing [sent. 10263 len. 21]: Their neighbours , however , provided their fuel , as they had often done in part for old John Peterson .
Parsing [sent. 10264 len. 29]: Before the winter came there was little left to be done ; and Annie saw by her aunt 's looks that she wanted to get rid of her .
Parsing [sent. 10265 len. 26]: Margaret Anderson had a chronic , consuming sense of poverty , and therefore worshipped with her whole soul the monkey Lars of saving and vigilance .
Parsing [sent. 10266 len. 36]: Hence Annie , as soon as Alec was gone , went , with the simplicity belonging to her childlike nature , to see Mrs Forbes , and returned to Clippenstrae only to bid them good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 10267 len. 18]: The bodily repose and mental activity of the winter formed a strong contrast with her last experiences .
Parsing [sent. 10268 len. 60]: But the rainy , foggy , frosty , snowy months passed away much as they had done before , fostering , amongst other hidden growths , that of Mrs Forbes ' love for her semi-proteg e , whom , like Castor and Pollux , she took half the year to heaven , and sent the other half to Tartarus .
Parsing [sent. 10269 len. 28]: One notable event , however , of considerable importance in its results to the people of Howglen , took place this winter amongst the missionars of Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 10270 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXXV .
Parsing [sent. 10271 len. 24]: So entire was Thomas Crann 's notion of discipline , that it could not be satisfied with the mere riddance of Robert Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 10272 len. 73]: Jealous , therefore , of encroachment on the part of minister or deacons , and opposed by his friend James Johnstone , he communicated his design to no one ; for he knew that the higher powers , anxious to avoid scandal wherever possible , would , instead of putting the hypocrite to shame as he deserved , merely send him a civil letter , requesting him to withdraw from their communion .
Parsing [sent. 10273 len. 57]: After watching for a fit opportunity , he resolved at length to make his accusation against Robert Bruce in person at an approaching church-meeting , at which , in consequence of the expected discussion of the question of the proper frequency of the administration of the sacrament , a full attendance of members might be expected .
Parsing [sent. 10274 len. 14]: They met in the chapel , which was partially lighted for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 10275 len. 15]: The night was brilliant with frosty stars , as Thomas walked to the rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 10276 len. 80]: He felt the vigour of the season in his yet unsubdued limbs , but as he watched his breath curling in the frosty air , and then vanishing in the night , he thought how the world itself would pass away before the face of Him that sat on the great white throne ; and how the missionars of Glamerton would have nothing to say for themselves on that day , if they did not purify themselves on this .
Parsing [sent. 10277 len. 46]: From the faint light of the stars he passed into the dull illumination of the tallow candles , and took his place in silence behind their snuffer , who , though half-witted , had yet shown intelligence and piety enough for admission into the community .
Parsing [sent. 10278 len. 17]: The church slowly gathered , and at length Mr Turnbull appeared , supported by his deacons .
Parsing [sent. 10279 len. 23]: After the usual preliminary devotions , in which Robert Bruce `` engaged , '' the business of the meeting was solemnly introduced .
Parsing [sent. 10280 len. 50]: The only part which Thomas Crann took in it was to expostulate with the candle-snuffer , who being violently opposed to the wishes of the minister , and not daring to speak , kept grumbling in no inaudible voice at everything that came from that side of the house .
Parsing [sent. 10281 len. 5]: `` Hoot , Richard !
Parsing [sent. 10282 len. 14]: it 's Scriptur ' , ye ken , '' said Thomas , soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 10283 len. 40]: `` Scriptur ' or no Scriptur ' , we 're nae for ` t , '' growled Richard aloud , and rising , gave vent to his excited feelings by snuffing out and relighting every candle in its turn .
Parsing [sent. 10284 len. 37]: At length the further discussion of the question was postponed to the next meeting , and the minister was preparing to give out a hymn , when Thomas Crann 's voice arose in the dusky space .
Parsing [sent. 10285 len. 22]: Mr Turnbull stopped to listen , and there fell an expectant silence ; for the stone-mason was both reverenced and feared .
Parsing [sent. 10286 len. 28]: It was too dark to see more than the dim bulk of his figure , but he spoke with slow emphasis , and every word was heard .
Parsing [sent. 10287 len. 20]: `` Brethren and office-beirers o ' the church , it 's upo ' discipline that I want to speak .
Parsing [sent. 10288 len. 21]: Discipline is ane o ' the main objecs for which a church is gathered by the speerit o ' God .
Parsing [sent. 10289 len. 26]: And we maun work discipleen amo ' oorsels , or else the rod o ' the Almichty 'll come doon upon a ' oor backs .
Parsing [sent. 10290 len. 9]: I winna haud ye frae particulars ony langer .
Parsing [sent. 10291 len. 27]: - Upon a certain Sawbath nicht i ' the last year , I gaed into Robert Bruce 's hoose , to hae worship wi ' 'm .
Parsing [sent. 10292 len. 13]: - I 'm gaein straucht and fair to the pint at ance .
Parsing [sent. 10293 len. 34]: Whan he opened the buik , I saw him slip something oot atween the leaves o ' ` t , and crunkle ' t up in 's han ' , luikin his greediest .
Parsing [sent. 10294 len. 9]: Syne he read the twenty-third and fourt psalms .
Parsing [sent. 10295 len. 32]: I cudna help watchin ' him , and whan we gaed down upo ' oor k-nees , I luikit roon efter him , and saw him pit something intil 's breek-pooch .
Parsing [sent. 10296 len. 7]: Weel , it stack to me .
Parsing [sent. 10297 len. 69]: Efterhin -LRB- afterwards -RRB- I fand oot frae the lassie Annie Anderson , that the buik was hers , that auld Mr Cooie had gie n't till her upo ' 's deith-bed , and had tell ' t her forbye that he had pitten a five poun ' note atween the leaves o ' ` t , to be her ain in remembrance o ' him , like .
Parsing [sent. 10298 len. 10]: What say ye to that , Robert Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10299 len. 62]: `` It 's a ' a lee , '' cried Robert , out of the dark back-ground under the gallery , where he always placed himself at such meetings , `` gotten up atween yersel ' and that ungratefu ' cousin o ' mine , Jeames Anderson 's lass , wha I hae keepit like ane o ' my ain . ''
Parsing [sent. 10300 len. 47]: Bruce had been sitting trembling ; but when Thomas put the question , believing that he had heard all that Thomas had to say , and that there was no proof against him , he resolved at once to meet the accusation with a stout denial .
Parsing [sent. 10301 len. 90]: Whereupon Thomas resumed : `` Ye hear him deny ` t. Weel , I hae seen the said Bible mysel ' ; and there 's this inscription upo ' ane o ' the blank leaves o ' ` t : ` Over the twenty-third psalm o ' David , ' - I tellt ye that he read that psalm that night - ` Over the twenty-third psalm o ' David , I hae laid a five poun ' note for my dear Annie Anderson , efter my deith ! '
Parsing [sent. 10302 len. 19]: Syne followed the nummer o ' the note , which I can shaw them that wants to see .
Parsing [sent. 10303 len. 39]: Noo I hae the banker 's word for statin ' that upo ' the very Monday mornin ' efter that Sunday , Bruce paid into the bank a five poun ' note o ' that verra indentical nummer .
Parsing [sent. 10304 len. 10]: What say ye to that , Robert Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10305 len. 4]: A silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 10306 len. 28]: Thomas himself broke it with the words : `` That money he oucht to hae supposed was Mr Cooie 's , and returned it till 's dochters .
Parsing [sent. 10307 len. 10]: But he pays ' t intil 's ain accoont .
Parsing [sent. 10308 len. 17]: Ca ' ye na that a breach o ' the eicht commandment , Robert Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10309 len. 6]: But now Robert Bruce rose .
Parsing [sent. 10310 len. 8]: And he spoke with solemnity and pathos .
Parsing [sent. 10311 len. 56]: `` It 's a sair thing , sirs , that amo ' Christians , wha ca ' themsel 's a chosen priesthood and a peculiar people , a jined member o ' the same church should meet wi ' sic ill-guideship as I hae met wi ' at the han 's o ' Mr Crann .
Parsing [sent. 10312 len. 105]: To say naething o ' his no bein ' ashamed to confess bein ' sic a heepocreet i ' the sicht o ' God as to luik aboot him upon his knees , lyin ' in wait for a man to do him hurt whan he pretendit to be worshippin ' wi ' him afore the Lord his Maker , to say naething o ' that which I wadna hae expeckit o ' him , he gangs aboot for auchteen months contrivin ' to bring that man to disgrace because he daurna mak ' sic a strong profession as he mak 's himsel ' .
Parsing [sent. 10313 len. 40]: But the warst o ' ' t a ' is , that he beguiles a young thochtless bairn , wha has been the cause o ' muckle discomfort in oor hoose , to jine him i ' the plot .
Parsing [sent. 10314 len. 66]: It 's true eneuch that I took the bank-note frae the Bible , whilk was a verra unshuitable place to put the unrichteous mammon intil , and min 's me upo ' the money-changers i ' the temple ; and it 's true that I paid it into the bank the neist day - '' `` What garred ye deny ` t , than ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10315 len. 3]: interrupted Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 10316 len. 12]: `` Bide a wee , Mr Crann , and caw canny .
Parsing [sent. 10317 len. 22]: Ye hae been hearkened till wi'oot interruption , and I maun hae fair play here whatever I get frae yersel ' .
Parsing [sent. 10318 len. 6]: I didna deny the fac .
Parsing [sent. 10319 len. 6]: Wha could deny a fac ?
Parsing [sent. 10320 len. 69]: But I denied a ' the haill affair , i ' the licht o ' wickedness and thievin ' that Mr Crann was castin ' upo ' ` t. _ I _ saw that inscription and read it wi ' my ain een the verra day the lassie brocht the beuk , and kenned as weel 's Mr Crann that the siller wasna to be taen hame again .
Parsing [sent. 10321 len. 89]: But I said to mysel ' : `` It 'll turn the lassie 's heid , and she 'll jist fling ' t awa ' in murlocks -LRB- crumbs -RRB- upo ' sweeties , and plunky , and sic like , ' for she was aye greedy , ` sae I 'll jist pit it into the bank wi ' my ain , and accoont for ' t efterhin wi ' the lave o ' her bit siller whan I gie that up intil her ain han 's .
Parsing [sent. 10322 len. 6]: Noo , Mr Crann ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10323 len. 9]: He sat down , and Mr Turnbull rose .
Parsing [sent. 10324 len. 27]: `` My Christian brethren , '' he said , `` it seems to me that this is not the proper place to discuss such a question .
Parsing [sent. 10325 len. 50]: It seems to me likewise ill-judged of Mr Crann to make such an accusation in public against Mr Bruce , who , I must say , has met it with a self-restraint and a self-possession most creditable to him , and has answered it in a very satisfactory manner .
Parsing [sent. 10326 len. 5]: The hundredth psalm . ''
Parsing [sent. 10327 len. 8]: `` Hooly and fairly , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10328 len. 10]: exclaimed Thomas , forgetting his manners in his eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 10329 len. 6]: `` I haena dune yet .
Parsing [sent. 10330 len. 21]: And whaur wad be the place to discuss sic a queston but afore a ' meetin o ' the church ?
Parsing [sent. 10331 len. 9]: Ca ' ye that the public , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 10332 len. 11]: Wasna the church institute for the sake o ' discipleen ?
Parsing [sent. 10333 len. 24]: Sic things are no to be ironed oot in a hole an ' a corner , atween you and the deycons , sir .
Parsing [sent. 10334 len. 7]: They belang to the haill body .
Parsing [sent. 10335 len. 22]: We 're a ' wranged thegither , and the Holy Ghost , whase temple we sud be , is wranged forby .
Parsing [sent. 10336 len. 38]: You at least micht ken , sir , that he 's withdrawn his presence frae oor mids ' , and we are but a candle under a bushel , and not a city set upon a hill .
Parsing [sent. 10337 len. 5]: We beir no witness .
Parsing [sent. 10338 len. 38]: And the cause o ' his displeesur ' is the accursed thing which the Ahchan in oor camp has hidden i ' the Coonty Bank , forby mony ither causes that come hame to us a ' .
Parsing [sent. 10339 len. 27]: And the warl ' jist scoffs at oor profession o ' religion , whan it sees sic a man as that in oor mids ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 10340 len. 19]: `` All this is nothing to the point , Mr Crann , '' said Mr Turnbull in displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 10341 len. 19]: `` It 's to the verra hert o ' the pint , '' returned Thomas , equally displeased .
Parsing [sent. 10342 len. 42]: `` Gin Robert Bruce saw the inscription the day the lassie broucht hame the buik , will he tell me hoo it was that he cam ' to lea ' the note i ' the buik till that Sawbath nicht ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10343 len. 30]: `` I luikit for ` t , but I cudna fin ' ` t , and thocht she had ta'en ' t oot upo ' the road hame . ''
Parsing [sent. 10344 len. 9]: `` Cudna ye fin ' the twenty-third psalm ?
Parsing [sent. 10345 len. 22]: - But jist ae thing mair , Mr Turnbull , and syne I 'll haud my tongue , '' resumed Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 10346 len. 18]: - `` Jeames Johnstone , will ye rin ower to my hoose , and fess the Bible ?
Parsing [sent. 10347 len. 9]: It 's lyin ' upo ' the drawers .
Parsing [sent. 10348 len. 6]: Ye canna mistak ' it .
Parsing [sent. 10349 len. 23]: - Jist hae patience till he comes back , sir , and we 'll see hoo Mr Bruce 'll read the inscription .
Parsing [sent. 10350 len. 22]: I wad hae made nothing o ' ` t , gin it hadna been for a frien ' o ' mine .
Parsing [sent. 10351 len. 17]: But Mr Bruce is a scholar , an ' 'll read the Laitin till 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 10352 len. 10]: By this time James Johnstone was across the street .
Parsing [sent. 10353 len. 18]: `` There 's some foul play in this , '' cried Bruce , out of the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 10354 len. 23]: `` My enemy maun sen ' for an ootlandish speech and a heathen tongue to insnare ane o ' the brethren ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10355 len. 4]: Profound silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 10356 len. 4]: All sat expectant .
Parsing [sent. 10357 len. 10]: The snuff of the candles grew longer and longer .
Parsing [sent. 10358 len. 23]: Even the energetic Richard , who had opposed the Scripture single-handed , forgot his duty in the absorbing interest of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 10359 len. 26]: Every ear was listening for the footsteps of the returning weaver , bringing the Bible of the parish-clergyman into the half-unhallowed precincts of a conventicle .
Parsing [sent. 10360 len. 25]: At a slight motion of one of the doors , an audible start of expectation broke like an electric spark from the still people .
Parsing [sent. 10361 len. 6]: But nothing came of it .
Parsing [sent. 10362 len. 25]: They had to wait full five minutes yet before the messenger returned , bearing the large volume in both hands in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 10363 len. 23]: `` Tak ' the buik up to Mr Turnbull , Jeames , and snuff his can ` les , '' said Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 10364 len. 25]: James took the snuffers , but Richard started up , snatched them from him , and performed the operation himself with his usual success .
Parsing [sent. 10365 len. 67]: The book being laid on the desk before Mr Turnbull , Thomas called out into the back region of the chapel , `` Noo , Robert Bruce , come foret , and fin ' oot this inscription that ye ken a ' aboot sae weel , and read it to the church , that they may see what a scholar they hae amo ' them . ''
Parsing [sent. 10366 len. 8]: But there was neither voice nor hearing .
Parsing [sent. 10367 len. 8]: After a pause , Mr Turnbull spoke .
Parsing [sent. 10368 len. 14]: `` Mr Bruce , we 're waiting for you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 10369 len. 6]: `` Do not be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 10370 len. 6]: You shall have justice . ''
Parsing [sent. 10371 len. 7]: A dead silence followed the appeal .
Parsing [sent. 10372 len. 24]: Presently some of those furthest back - they were women in hooded cloaks and _ mutches _ - spoke in scarce audible voices .
Parsing [sent. 10373 len. 8]: `` He 's no here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 10374 len. 9]: We canna see him , '' they said .
Parsing [sent. 10375 len. 8]: The minister could not distinguish their words .
Parsing [sent. 10376 len. 5]: `` No here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10377 len. 14]: cried Thomas , who , deaf as he was , had heard them .
Parsing [sent. 10378 len. 8]: `` He was here a minute ago !
Parsing [sent. 10379 len. 7]: His conscience has spoken at last .
Parsing [sent. 10380 len. 14]: He 's fa'en doon , like Ananias , i ' the seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 10381 len. 14]: Richard snatched a candle out of the candelabrum , and went to look .
Parsing [sent. 10382 len. 5]: Others followed similarly provided .
Parsing [sent. 10383 len. 28]: They searched the pew where he had been sitting , and the neighbouring pews , and the whole chapel , but he was nowhere to be found .
Parsing [sent. 10384 len. 23]: `` That wad hae been him , whan I heard the door bang , '' they said to each other at length .
Parsing [sent. 10385 len. 5]: And so it was .
Parsing [sent. 10386 len. 32]: For perceiving how he had committed himself , he had slipped down in the pew , crawled on all fours to the door , and got out of the place unsuspected .
Parsing [sent. 10387 len. 32]: A formal sentence of expulsion was passed upon him by a show of hands , and the word _ Expelled _ was written against his name in the list of church-members .
Parsing [sent. 10388 len. 15]: `` Thomas Crann , will you engage in prayer , '' said Mr Turnbull .
Parsing [sent. 10389 len. 11]: `` Na , nae the nicht , '' answered Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 10390 len. 17]: `` I 'm like ane under the auld law that had been buryin ' the deid .
Parsing [sent. 10391 len. 18]: I hae been doin ' necessar ' but foul wark , and I 'm defiled in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 10392 len. 12]: I 'm no in a richt speerit to pray in public .
Parsing [sent. 10393 len. 9]: I maun awa ' hame to my prayers .
Parsing [sent. 10394 len. 24]: I houp I mayna do something mysel ' afore lang that 'll mak ' it necessar ' for ye to dismiss me neist .
Parsing [sent. 10395 len. 15]: But gin that time sud come , spare not , I beseech ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 10396 len. 20]: So , after a short prayer from Mr Turnbull , the meeting separated in a state of considerable excitement .
Parsing [sent. 10397 len. 20]: Thomas half expected to hear of an action for libel , but Robert knew better than venture upon that .
Parsing [sent. 10398 len. 11]: Besides , no damages could be got out of Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 10399 len. 30]: When Bruce was once outside the chapel , he assumed the erect posture to which his claim was entirely one of species , and went home by circuitous ways .
Parsing [sent. 10400 len. 12]: He found the shop still open , attended by his wife .
Parsing [sent. 10401 len. 6]: `` Preserve 's , Robert !
Parsing [sent. 10402 len. 7]: what 's come ower ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10403 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 10404 len. 27]: `` I had sic a sair heid -LRB- headache -RRB- , I was forced to come oot afore a ' was dune , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 10405 len. 24]: `` I dinna think I 'll gang ony mair , for they dinna conduc ' things a ` thegither to my likin ' .
Parsing [sent. 10406 len. 9]: I winna fash mair wi ' them . ''
Parsing [sent. 10407 len. 35]: His wife looked at him anxiously , perhaps with some vague suspicion of the truth ; but she said nothing , and I do not believe the matter was ever alluded to between them .
Parsing [sent. 10408 len. 42]: The only indications remaining the next day of what he had gone through that evening , consisted in an increase of suavity towards his grown customers , and of acerbity towards the children who were unfortunate enough to enter his shop .
Parsing [sent. 10409 len. 20]: Of the two , however , perhaps Thomas Crann was the more unhappy as he went home that night .
Parsing [sent. 10410 len. 16]: He felt nothing of the elation which commonly springs from success in a cherished project .
Parsing [sent. 10411 len. 54]: He had been the promoter and agent in the downfall of another man , and although the fall was a just one , and it was better too for the man to be down than standing on a false pedestal , Thomas could not help feeling the reaction of a fellow-creature 's humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 10412 len. 27]: Now that the thing was done , and the end gained , the eternal brotherhood asserted itself , and Thomas pitied Bruce and mourned over him .
Parsing [sent. 10413 len. 21]: He must be to him henceforth as a heathen man and a publican , and he was sorry for him .
Parsing [sent. 10414 len. 44]: `` Ye see , '' he said to himself , `` it 's no like a slip or a sin ; but an evil disease cleaveth fast unto him , and there 's sma ' chance o ' him ever repentin ' noo .
Parsing [sent. 10415 len. 12]: A'thing has been dune for him that can be dune . ''
Parsing [sent. 10416 len. 74]: Yet Thomas worshipped a God , who , if the theories Thomas held were correct , could at once , by the free gift of a Holy Spirit , generate repentance in Bruce , and so make him fit for salvation ; but who , Thomas believed , would not do so - at all events , _ might _ not do so - keeping him alive for ever in howling unbelief instead .
Parsing [sent. 10417 len. 14]: Scarcely any of the `` members '' henceforth saluted Bruce in the street .
Parsing [sent. 10418 len. 24]: None of them traded with him , except two or three who owed him a few shillings , and could not pay him .
Parsing [sent. 10419 len. 13]: And the modifying effect upon the week 's returns was very perceptible .
Parsing [sent. 10420 len. 15]: This was the only form in which a recognizable vengeance could have reached him .
Parsing [sent. 10421 len. 22]: To escape from it , he had serious thoughts of leaving the place , and setting up in some remote village .
Parsing [sent. 10422 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 10423 len. 109]: Notwithstanding Alec 's diligence and the genial companionship of Mr Cupples - whether the death of Kate , or his own illness , or the reaction of shame after his sojourn in the tents of wickedness , had opened dark visions of the world of reality lying in awful _ unknownness _ around the life he seemed to know , I can not tell , - cold isolations would suddenly seize upon him , wherein he would ask himself - that oracular cave in which one hears a thousand questions before one reply - `` What is the use of it all - this study and labour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10424 len. 13]: And he interpreted the silence to mean : `` Life is worthless .
Parsing [sent. 10425 len. 16]: There is no glow in it - only a glimmer and shine at best . ''
Parsing [sent. 10426 len. 13]: - Will my readers set this condition down as one of disease ?
Parsing [sent. 10427 len. 28]: If they do , I ask , `` Why should a man be satisfied with anything such as was now within the grasp of Alec Forbes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10428 len. 34]: And if they reply that a higher ambition would have set him at peace if not at rest , I only say that they would be nearer health if they had his disease .
Parsing [sent. 10429 len. 43]: Pain is not malady ; it is the revelation of malady - the meeting and recoil between the unknown death and the unknown life ; that jar of the system whereby the fact becomes known to the man that he is ill .
Parsing [sent. 10430 len. 16]: There was disease in Alec , but the disease did not lie in his dissatisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 10431 len. 18]: It lay in that poverty of life with which those are satisfied who call such discontent disease .
Parsing [sent. 10432 len. 14]: Such disease is the first flicker of the aurora of a rising health .
Parsing [sent. 10433 len. 57]: This state of feeling , however , was only occasional ; and a reviving interest in anything belonging to his studies , or a merry talk with Mr Cupples , would dispel it for a time , just as a breath of fine air will give the sense of perfect health to one dying of consumption .
Parsing [sent. 10434 len. 63]: But what made these questionings develope into the thorns of a more definite self-condemnation - the advanced guard sometimes of the roses of peace - was simply this : He had written to his mother for money to lay out upon superior instruments , and new chemical apparatus ; and his mother had replied sadly that she was unable to send it .
Parsing [sent. 10435 len. 13]: She hinted that his education had cost more than she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 10436 len. 26]: She told him that she was in debt to Robert Bruce , and had of late been compelled to delay the payment of its interest .
Parsing [sent. 10437 len. 40]: She informed him also that , even under James Dow 's conscientious management , there seemed little ground for hoping that the farm would ever make a return correspondent to the large outlay his father had made upon it .
Parsing [sent. 10438 len. 8]: This letter stung Alec to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 10439 len. 40]: That his mother should be in the power of such a man as Bruce , was bad enough ; but that she should have been exposed for his sake to the indignity of requesting his forbearance , seemed unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 10440 len. 18]: To despise the man was no satisfaction , the right and the wrong being where they were .
Parsing [sent. 10441 len. 16]: - And what proportion of the expenses of last session had gone to his college-accounts ?
Parsing [sent. 10442 len. 14]: He wrote a humble letter to his mother - and worked still harder .
Parsing [sent. 10443 len. 18]: For although he could not make a shilling at present , the future had hope in it .
Parsing [sent. 10444 len. 41]: Meantime Mr Cupples , in order that he might bear such outward signs of inward grace as would appeal to the perceptions of the Senatus , got a new hat , and changed his shabby tail-coat for a black frock .
Parsing [sent. 10445 len. 23]: His shirt ceased to be a hypothesis to account for his collar , and became a real hypostasis , evident and clean .
Parsing [sent. 10446 len. 36]: These signs of improvement led to inquiries on the part of the Senatus , and the result was that , before three months of the session were over , he was formally installed as librarian .
Parsing [sent. 10447 len. 21]: His first impulse on receiving the good news was to rush down to Luckie Cumstie 's and have a double-tumbler .
Parsing [sent. 10448 len. 33]: But conscience was too strong for Satan , and sent him home to his pipe - which , it must be confessed , he smoked twice as much as before his reformation .
Parsing [sent. 10449 len. 28]: From the moment of his appointment , he seemed to regard the library as his own private property , or , rather , as his own family .
Parsing [sent. 10450 len. 30]: He was grandfather to the books : at least a grandfather shows that combination of parent and servant which comes nearest to the relation he henceforth manifested towards them .
Parsing [sent. 10451 len. 48]: Most of them he gave out graciously ; some of them grudgingly ; a few of them with much reluctance ; but all of them with injunctions to care , and special warnings against forcing the backs , crumpling or folding the leaves , and making thumb-marks .
Parsing [sent. 10452 len. 46]: `` Noo , '' he would say to some country bejan , `` tak ' the buik i ' yer han 's no as gin ` twar a neip -LRB- turnip -RRB- , but as gin ` twar the sowl o ' a new-born bairn .
Parsing [sent. 10453 len. 44]: Min ' ye it has to sair -LRB- serve -RRB- mony a generation efter your banes lie bare i ' the moul ' , an ' ye maun hae respec ' to them that come efter ye , and no ill-guide their fare .
Parsing [sent. 10454 len. 13]: I beg ye winna guddle ' t -LRB- mangle it -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 10455 len. 10]: The bejans used to laugh at him in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 10456 len. 19]: But long before they were magistrands , the best of them had a profound respect for the librarian .
Parsing [sent. 10457 len. 41]: Not a few of them repaired to him with all their difficulties ; and such a general favourite was he , that any story of his humour or oddity was sure to be received with a roar of loving laughter .
Parsing [sent. 10458 len. 29]: Indeed I doubt whether , within the course of a curriculum , Mr Cupples had not become the real centre of intellectual and moral life in that college .
Parsing [sent. 10459 len. 27]: One evening , as he and Alec were sitting together speculating on the speediest mode of turning Alec 's acquirements to money-account , their landlady entered .
Parsing [sent. 10460 len. 52]: `` Here 's my cousin , '' she said , `` Captain McTavish o ' the _ Sea-horse _ , Mr Forbes , wha says that afore lang he 'll be wantin ' a young doctor to gang and haud the scurvy aff o ' his men at the whaul-fishin ' .
Parsing [sent. 10461 len. 19]: Sae of coorse I thoucht o ' my ain first , and ran up the stair to you .
Parsing [sent. 10462 len. 40]: It 'll be fifty poun ' i ' yer pooch , and a plenty o ' rouch ploys that the like o ' you young fallows likes , though I canna say I wad like sic things mysel ' .
Parsing [sent. 10463 len. 17]: Only I 'm an auld wife , ye see , and that maks the differ . ''
Parsing [sent. 10464 len. 19]: `` Nae that auld , Mistress Leslie , '' said Cupples , `` gin ye wadna lee . ''
Parsing [sent. 10465 len. 35]: `` Tell Captain McTavish that I 'll gang , '' said Alec , who had hesitated no longer than the time Mr Cupples took to say the word of kind flattery to their landlady .
Parsing [sent. 10466 len. 10]: `` He 'll want testimonials , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 10467 len. 14]: `` Wadna _ ye _ gie me ane , Mrs Leslie ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 10468 len. 13]: ` Deed wad I , gin ` twar o ' ony accoont .
Parsing [sent. 10469 len. 21]: Ye see , Mr Alec , the day 's no yesterday ; and this session 's no the last . ''
Parsing [sent. 10470 len. 17]: `` Haud yer tongue , and dinna rub a sair place , '' cried Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 10471 len. 13]: `` I beg yer pardon , '' returned Mrs Leslie , submissively .
Parsing [sent. 10472 len. 7]: Alec followed her down the stair .
Parsing [sent. 10473 len. 10]: He soon returned , his eyes flashing with delight .
Parsing [sent. 10474 len. 2]: Adventure !
Parsing [sent. 10475 len. 9]: And fifty pounds to take to his mother !
Parsing [sent. 10476 len. 7]: `` All right , Mr Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 10477 len. 13]: The Captain has promised to take me if my testimonials are satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 10478 len. 10]: I think they will give me good ones now .
Parsing [sent. 10479 len. 22]: If it were n't for you , I should have been lying in the gutter instead of walking the quarter-deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 10480 len. 7]: `` Weel , weel , bantam .
Parsing [sent. 10481 len. 8]: There 's twa sides to maist obligations .
Parsing [sent. 10482 len. 6]: - I 'm leebrarian . ''
Parsing [sent. 10483 len. 29]: The reader may remember that in his boyhood Alec was fond of the sea , had rigged a flagstaff , and had built the _ Bonnie Annie _ .
Parsing [sent. 10484 len. 18]: He was nearly beside himself with delight , which continued unjarred until he heard from his mother .
Parsing [sent. 10485 len. 25]: She had too much good sense to make any opposition , but she could not prevent her anticipations of loss and loneliness from appearing .
Parsing [sent. 10486 len. 16]: His mother 's trouble quelled the exuberance of Alec 's spirits without altering his resolve .
Parsing [sent. 10487 len. 25]: He would return to her in the fall of the year , bringing with him what would ease her mind of half its load .
Parsing [sent. 10488 len. 10]: There was no check at the examinations this session .
Parsing [sent. 10489 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXXVII .
Parsing [sent. 10490 len. 8]: Mrs Forbes was greatly perplexed about Annie .
Parsing [sent. 10491 len. 35]: She could not bear the thought of turning her out ; and besides she did not see where she was to go , for she could not be in the house with young Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 10492 len. 35]: On the other hand , she had still the same dangerous sense of worldly duty as to the prevention of a so-called unsuitable match , the chance of which was more threatening than ever .
Parsing [sent. 10493 len. 28]: For Annie had grown very lovely , and having taken captive the affections of the mother , must put the heart of the son in dire jeopardy .
Parsing [sent. 10494 len. 32]: But Alec arrived two days before he was expected , and delivered his mother from her perplexity by declaring that if Annie were sent away he too would leave the house .
Parsing [sent. 10495 len. 67]: He had seen through the maternal precautions the last time he was at home , and talking with Cupples about it , who secretly wished for no better luck than that Alec should fall in love with Annie , had his feelings strengthened as to the unkindness , if not injustice , of throwing her periodically into such a dungeon as the society of the Bruces .
Parsing [sent. 10496 len. 18]: So Annie remained where she was , much , I must confess , to her inward content .
Parsing [sent. 10497 len. 28]: The youth and the maiden met every day - the youth unembarrassed , and the maiden reserved and shy , even to the satisfaction of the mother .
Parsing [sent. 10498 len. 78]: But if Alec could have seen the loving thoughts which , like threads of heavenly gold -LRB- for all the gold of heaven is invisible -RRB- , wrought themselves into the garments she made for him , I do not think _ he _ could have helped falling in love with her , although most men , I fear , would only have fallen the more in love with themselves , and cared the less for her .
Parsing [sent. 10499 len. 51]: But he did not see them , or hear the divine measures to which her needle flew , as she laboured to arm him against the cold of those regions Where all life dies , death lives , and nature breeds , Perverse , all monstrous , all prodigious things .
Parsing [sent. 10500 len. 14]: Alec 's college-life had interposed a gulf between him and his previous history .
Parsing [sent. 10501 len. 75]: But his approaching departure into places unknown and a life untried , operated upon his spiritual condition like the approach of death ; and he must strengthen again all the old bonds which had been stretched thin by time and absence ; he must make righteous atonement for the wrong of neglect ; in short , he must set his inward house in order , ere he went forth to the abodes of ice .
Parsing [sent. 10502 len. 11]: Death is not a breaker but a renewer of ties .
Parsing [sent. 10503 len. 47]: And if in view of death we gird up the loins of our minds , and unite our hearts into a whole of love , and tenderness , and atonement , and forgiveness , then Death himself can not be that thing of forlornness and loss .
Parsing [sent. 10504 len. 55]: He took a day to go and see Curly , and spent a pleasant afternoon with him , recalling the old times , and the old stories , and the old companions ; for the youth with the downy chin has a past as ancient as that of the man with the gray beard .
Parsing [sent. 10505 len. 20]: And Curly told him the story of his encounter with young Bruce on the bank of the Wan Water .
Parsing [sent. 10506 len. 19]: And over and over again Annie 's name came up , but Curly never hinted at her secret .
Parsing [sent. 10507 len. 10]: The next evening he went to see Thomas Crann .
Parsing [sent. 10508 len. 12]: Thomas received him with a cordiality amounting even to gruff tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 10509 len. 46]: `` I 'm richt glaid to see ye , '' he said ; `` and I tak ' it verra kin ' o ' ye , wi ' a ' yer gran ' learnin ' , to come and see an ignorant man like me .
Parsing [sent. 10510 len. 21]: But Alec , my man , there 's some things ` at I ken better nor ye ken them yet .
Parsing [sent. 10511 len. 16]: Him that made the whauls is better worth seekin ' nor the whauls themsel 's .
Parsing [sent. 10512 len. 32]: God 's works may swallow the man that follows them , but God himsel ' 's the hidin ' - place frae the wind , and the covert frae the tempest .
Parsing [sent. 10513 len. 39]: Set na up nae fause God - that 's the thing ` at ye lo'e best , ye ken - for like Dawgon , it 'll fa ' , and maybe brain ye i ' the fa ' .
Parsing [sent. 10514 len. 17]: Come doon upo ' yer knees wi ' me , and I 'll pray for ye .
Parsing [sent. 10515 len. 23]: But ye maun pray for yersel ' , or my prayers winna be o ' muckle avail : ye ken that . ''
Parsing [sent. 10516 len. 207]: Yielding to the spiritual power of Thomas , whose gray-blue eyes were flashing with fervour , Alec kneeled down as he was desired , and Thomas said : `` O thou who madest the whales to play i ' the great watters , and gavest unto men sic a need o ' licht that they maun hunt the leviathan to haud their lamps burnin ' at nicht whan thou hast sent thy sun awa ' to ither lands , be thou roon ' aboot this youth , wha surely is nae muckle waur than him ` at the Saviour lo'ed ; and when thou seest his ship gang sailin ' into the far north whaur thou keepest thy stores o ' frost and snaw ready to remin ' men o ' thy goodness by takin ' the heat frae them for a sizzon - when thou seest his ship gaein far north , pit doon thy finger , O Lord , and straik a track afore ` t , throu ' amo ' the hills o ' ice , that it may gang throu ' in saf-ety , even as thy chosen people gaed throu ' the Reid Sea , and the river o ' Jordan .
Parsing [sent. 10517 len. 14]: For , Lord , we want him hame again in thy good time .
Parsing [sent. 10518 len. 16]: For he is the only son of his mother , and she is a widow .
Parsing [sent. 10519 len. 32]: But aboon a ' , O Lord , elec ' him to thy grace and lat him ken the glory o ' God , even the licht o ' thy coontenance .
Parsing [sent. 10520 len. 20]: For me , I 'm a ' thine , to live or dee , and I care not which .
Parsing [sent. 10521 len. 36]: For I hae gotten the gueed o ' this warl ' ; and gin I binna ready for the neist , it 's because o ' my sins , and no o ' my savours .
Parsing [sent. 10522 len. 11]: For I wad glaidle depairt and be with the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 10523 len. 44]: But this young man has never seen thy face ; and , O Lord , I 'm jist feared that my coontenance micht fa ' even in thy kingdom , gin I kent that Alec Forbes was doon i ' the ill place .
Parsing [sent. 10524 len. 39]: Spare him , O Lord , and gie him time for repentance gin he has a chance ; but gin he has nane , tak ' him at ance , that his doom may be the lichter . ''
Parsing [sent. 10525 len. 36]: Alec rose with a very serious face , and went home to his mother in a mood more concordant with her feelings than the light-heartedness with which he generally tried to laugh away her apprehensions .
Parsing [sent. 10526 len. 13]: He even called on Robert Bruce , at his mother 's request .
Parsing [sent. 10527 len. 10]: It went terribly against the grain with him though .
Parsing [sent. 10528 len. 36]: He expected to find him rude as of old , but he was , on the contrary , as pleasant as a man could be whose only notion of politeness lay in _ licking _ .
Parsing [sent. 10529 len. 15]: His civility came from two sources - the one hope , the other fear .
Parsing [sent. 10530 len. 9]: Alec was going away and might never return .
Parsing [sent. 10531 len. 5]: That was the hope .
Parsing [sent. 10532 len. 26]: For although Bruce had spread the report of Annie 's engagement to Curly , he believed that Alec was the real obstacle to his plans .
Parsing [sent. 10533 len. 54]: At the same time he was afraid of him , believing in his cowardly mind that Alec would not stop short of personal reprisals if he should offend him ; and now he was a great six-foot fellow , of whose prowess at college confused and exaggerated stories were floating about the town .
Parsing [sent. 10534 len. 27]: - Bruce was a man who could hatch and cherish plans , keeping one in reserve behind the other , and beholding their result from afar .
Parsing [sent. 10535 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 10536 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 10537 len. 17]: Mr Forbes - sae ye 're gaun awa ' amo ' the train-ile , are ye ?
Parsing [sent. 10538 len. 12]: Hae ye ony share i ' the tak ' no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10539 len. 15]: `` I do n't think the doctor has any share , '' answered Alec .
Parsing [sent. 10540 len. 21]: `` But I warran ' ye 'll put to yer han ' , and help at the catchin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 10541 len. 5]: `` Very likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 10542 len. 63]: `` Weel , gin ye come in for a barrel or twa , ye may coont upo ' me to tak it aff yer han ' , at the ordinar ' price - to the _ wholesale _ merchan 's , ye ken - wi ' maybe a sma ' discoont for orderin ' ' t afore the whaul was ta'en . ''
Parsing [sent. 10543 len. 5]: The day drew near .
Parsing [sent. 10544 len. 8]: He had bidden all his friends farewell .
Parsing [sent. 10545 len. 63]: He must go just as the spring was coming in with the old well-beloved green borne before her on the white banner of the snowdrop , and following in miles of jubilation : he must not wait for her triumph , but speed away before her towards the dreary north , which only a few of her hard-riding pursuivants would ever reach .
Parsing [sent. 10546 len. 60]: For green hills he must have opal-hued bergs - for green fields the outspread slaty waters , rolling in the delight of their few weeks of glorious freedom , and mocking the unwieldy ice-giants that rush in wind-driven troops across their plains , or welter captive in the weary swell , and melt away beneath the low summer sun .
Parsing [sent. 10547 len. 24]: His mother would have gone to see him on board , but he prevailed upon her to say good-bye to him at home .
Parsing [sent. 10548 len. 10]: She kept her tears till after he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 10549 len. 20]: Annie bade him farewell with a pale face , and a smile that was all sweetness and no gladness .
Parsing [sent. 10550 len. 7]: She did not weep even afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 10551 len. 21]: A gentle cold hand pressed her heart down , so that neither blood reached her face nor water her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10552 len. 23]: She went about everything just as before , because it had to be done ; but it seemed foolish to do anything .
Parsing [sent. 10553 len. 17]: The spring might as well stay away for any good that it promised either of them .
Parsing [sent. 10554 len. 20]: As Mr Cupples was taking his farewell on board , `` Ye 'll gang and see my mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10555 len. 3]: said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 10556 len. 12]: `` Ay , ay , bantam ; I 'll do that .
Parsing [sent. 10557 len. 16]: - Noo tak care o ' yersel ; and dinna tak leeberties wi ' behemoth .
Parsing [sent. 10558 len. 18]: Put a ring in 's nose gin ye like , only haud oot ower frae 's tail .
Parsing [sent. 10559 len. 13]: He 's no mowse -LRB- not to be meddled with -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 10560 len. 20]: So away went Alec northwards , over the blue-gray waters , surgeon of the strong barque _ Sea-horse _ .
Parsing [sent. 10561 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 10562 len. 16]: Two days after Alec 's departure , Mr Bruce called at Howglen to see Annie .
Parsing [sent. 10563 len. 8]: `` Hoo are ye , Mistress Forbes ?
Parsing [sent. 10564 len. 7]: Hoo are ye , Miss Anderson ?
Parsing [sent. 10565 len. 33]: I was jist comin ' ower the watter for a walk , and I thocht I micht as weel fess the bit siller wi ' me that I 'm awin ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 10566 len. 3]: Annie stared .
Parsing [sent. 10567 len. 8]: She did not know what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 10568 len. 3]: He explained .
Parsing [sent. 10569 len. 54]: `` It 's weel on till a towmon -LRB- twelvemonth -RRB- that ye hae had neither bite nor sup aneath my heumble riggin-tree -LRB- rooftree -RRB- , and as that was the upmak for the interest , I maun pay ye the tane seein ' ye winna accep ' o ' the tither .
Parsing [sent. 10570 len. 21]: I hae jist brocht ye ten poun ' to pit i ' yer ain pooch i ' the meantime . ''
Parsing [sent. 10571 len. 7]: Annie could hardly believe her ears .
Parsing [sent. 10572 len. 11]: Could she be the rightful owner of such untold wealth ?
Parsing [sent. 10573 len. 26]: Without giving her time to say anything , however , Bruce went on , still holding in his hand the dirty bunch of one-pound notes .
Parsing [sent. 10574 len. 32]: `` But I 'm thinkin ' the best way o ' disposin ' o ' ' t wad be to lat me put it to the lave o ' the prencipal .
Parsing [sent. 10575 len. 14]: Sae I 'll jist tak it to the bank as I gang back .
Parsing [sent. 10576 len. 36]: I canna gie ye onything for ` t , 'cause that wad be brakin ' the law against compoon interest , but I can mak ' it up some ither gait , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 10577 len. 20]: But Annie had been too much pleased at the prospect of possession to let the money go so easily .
Parsing [sent. 10578 len. 24]: `` I hae plenty o ' ways o ' spen ` in ' ` t , '' she said , `` withoot wastry .
Parsing [sent. 10579 len. 18]: Sae I 'll jist tak ' it mysel ' , and thank ye , Mr Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 10580 len. 12]: She rose and took the notes from Bruce 's unwilling hand .
Parsing [sent. 10581 len. 24]: He was on the point of replacing them in his trowsers-pocket and refusing to give them up , when her promptitude rescued them .
Parsing [sent. 10582 len. 24]: Discomfiture was manifest in his reluctant eyes , and the little tug of retraction with which he loosed his hold upon the notes .
Parsing [sent. 10583 len. 19]: He went home mortified , and poverty-stricken , but yet having gained a step towards a further end .
Parsing [sent. 10584 len. 9]: Annie begged Mrs Forbes to take the money .
Parsing [sent. 10585 len. 10]: `` I have no use for it , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 10586 len. 21]: An old gown of yours makes as good a frock for me as I can ever want to have . ''
Parsing [sent. 10587 len. 31]: But Mrs Forbes would not even take charge of the money - partly from the pride of beneficence , partly from the fear of involving it in her own straits .
Parsing [sent. 10588 len. 22]: So that Annie , having provided herself with a few necessaries , felt free to spend the rest as she would .
Parsing [sent. 10589 len. 7]: How she longed for Tibbie Dyster !
Parsing [sent. 10590 len. 19]: But not having her , she went to Thomas Crann , and offered the money to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 10591 len. 6]: ` Deed no , lassie !
Parsing [sent. 10592 len. 21]: I winna lay a finger upo ' ` t. Lay ' t by till ye want it yersel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 10593 len. 16]: `` Dinna ye ken somebody that wants ' t mair nor me , Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10594 len. 47]: Now Thomas had just been reading a few words spoken , according to Matthew , the tax-gatherer , by the King of Men , declaring the perfection of God to consist in his giving good things to all alike , whether they love him or not .
Parsing [sent. 10595 len. 16]: And when Annie asked the question , he remembered the passage and Peter Peterson together .
Parsing [sent. 10596 len. 36]: But he could not trust her to follow her own instincts , and therefore went with her to see the poor fellow , who was in a consumption , and would never drink any more .
Parsing [sent. 10597 len. 66]: When he saw his worn face , and the bones with hands at the ends of them , his heart smote him that he had ever been harsh to him ; and although he had gone with the intention of rousing him to a sense of his danger beyond the grave , he found that for very pity he could not open the prophetic mouth .
Parsing [sent. 10598 len. 32]: From self-accusation he took shelter behind Annie , saying to himself : `` Babes can best declare what 's best revealed to them ; '' and left Peter to her ministrations .
Parsing [sent. 10599 len. 69]: A little money went far to make his last days comfortable ; and ere she had been visiting him for more than a month , he loved her so that he was able to believe that God might love him , though he knew perfectly -LRB- wherein perhaps his drunkenness had taught him more than the prayers of many a pharisee -RRB- that he could not deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 10600 len. 16]: This was the beginning of a new relation between Annie and the poor of Glamerton .
Parsing [sent. 10601 len. 25]: And the soul of the maiden grew and blossomed into divine tenderness , for it was still more blessed to give than to receive .
Parsing [sent. 10602 len. 27]: But she was only allowed to taste of this blessedness , for she had soon to learn that even giving itself must be given away cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 10603 len. 12]: After three months Bruce called again with the quarter 's interest .
Parsing [sent. 10604 len. 63]: Before the next period arrived he had an interview with James Dow , to whom he represented that , as he was now paying the interest down in cash , he ought not to be exposed to the inconvenience of being called upon at any moment to restore the principal , but should have the money secured to him for ten years .
Parsing [sent. 10605 len. 20]: After consultation , James Dow consented to a three years ' loan , beyond which he would not yield .
Parsing [sent. 10606 len. 21]: Papers to this effect were signed , and one quarter 's interest more was placed in Annie 's willing hand .
Parsing [sent. 10607 len. 16]: In the middle of summer Mr Cupples made his appearance , and was warmly welcomed .
Parsing [sent. 10608 len. 26]: He had at length completed the catalogue of the library , had got the books arranged to his mind , and was brimful of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 10609 len. 86]: He ran about the fields like a child ; gathered bunches of white clover ; made a great kite , and bought an unmeasureable length of string , with which he flew it the first day the wind was worthy of the honour ; got out Alec 's boat , and upset himself in the Glamour ; was run away with by one of the plough-horses in the attempt to ride him to the water ; was laughed at and loved by everybody about Howglen .
Parsing [sent. 10610 len. 21]: At length , that is , in about ten days , he began to settle down into sobriety of demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 10611 len. 17]: The first thing that sobered him was a hint of yellow upon a field of oats .
Parsing [sent. 10612 len. 20]: He began at once to go and see the people of Glamerton , and called upon Thomas Crann first .
Parsing [sent. 10613 len. 21]: He found him in one of his gloomy moods , which however were much less frequent than they had been .
Parsing [sent. 10614 len. 10]: `` Hoo are ye , auld frien ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10615 len. 3]: said Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 10616 len. 18]: `` Auld as ye say , sir , and nae muckle farrer on nor whan I begud .
Parsing [sent. 10617 len. 12]: I whiles think I hae profited less than onybody I ken .
Parsing [sent. 10618 len. 32]: But eh , sir , I wad be sorry , gin I was you , to dee afore I had gotten a glimp o ' the face o ' God . ''
Parsing [sent. 10619 len. 16]: `` Hoo ken ye that I haena gotten a glimp o ' that same ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10620 len. 12]: `` Ye wad luik mair solemn like , '' answered Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 10621 len. 11]: `` Maybe I wad , '' responded Cupples , seriously .
Parsing [sent. 10622 len. 8]: `` Man , strive to get it .
Parsing [sent. 10623 len. 14]: Gie Him no rist , day nor nicht , till ye get it .
Parsing [sent. 10624 len. 14]: Knock , knock , knock , till it be opened till ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 10625 len. 17]: `` Weel , Thomas , ye dinna seem sae happy yersel ' , efter a ' .
Parsing [sent. 10626 len. 41]: Dinna ye think ye may be like ane that 's tryin ' to see the face o ' whilk ye speyk throu a crack i ' the door , in place o ' haein patience till it 's opened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10627 len. 19]: But the suggestion was quite lost upon Thomas , who , after a gloomy pause , went on .
Parsing [sent. 10628 len. 24]: `` Sin 's sic an awfu ' thing , '' he began ; when the door opened , and in walked James Dow .
Parsing [sent. 10629 len. 9]: His entrance did not interrupt Thomas , however .
Parsing [sent. 10630 len. 9]: `` Sin 's sic an awfu ' thing !
Parsing [sent. 10631 len. 29]: And I hae sinned sae aften and sae lang , that maybe He 'll be forced efter a ' to sen ' me to the bottomless pit . ''
Parsing [sent. 10632 len. 7]: `` Hoot , hoot , Thamas !
Parsing [sent. 10633 len. 11]: dinna speyk sic awfu ' things , '' said Dow .
Parsing [sent. 10634 len. 9]: `` They 're dreadfu ' to hearken till .
Parsing [sent. 10635 len. 16]: I s ' warran ' He 's as kin ' - hertit as yersel . ''
Parsing [sent. 10636 len. 14]: James had no reputation for piety , though much for truthfulness and honesty .
Parsing [sent. 10637 len. 16]: Nor had he any idea how much lay in the words he had hastily uttered .
Parsing [sent. 10638 len. 10]: A light-gleam grew and faded on Thomas 's face .
Parsing [sent. 10639 len. 19]: `` I said , he micht be _ forced _ to sen ' me efter a ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 10640 len. 6]: `` What , Thomas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10641 len. 3]: cried Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 10642 len. 8]: `` He _ cudna _ save ye !
Parsing [sent. 10643 len. 11]: Wi ' the Son and the Speerit to help him ?
Parsing [sent. 10644 len. 9]: And a willin ' hert in you forbye ?
Parsing [sent. 10645 len. 2]: Fegs !
Parsing [sent. 10646 len. 18]: ye hae a greater opinion o ' Sawtan nor I gied ye the discredit o ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 10647 len. 10]: `` Na , na ; it 's nae Sawtan .
Parsing [sent. 10648 len. 5]: It 's mysel ' .
Parsing [sent. 10649 len. 18]: I wadna lay mair wyte -LRB- blame -RRB- upo ' Sawtan 's shouthers nor 's his ain .
Parsing [sent. 10650 len. 9]: He has eneuch already , puir fallow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10651 len. 24]: `` Ye 'll be o ' auld Robbie Burns 's opinion , that he ` aiblins micht still hae a stake . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 10652 len. 9]: `` Na , na ; he has nane .
Parsing [sent. 10653 len. 6]: Burns was nae prophet . ''
Parsing [sent. 10654 len. 15]: `` But jist suppose , Thomas - gin the de'il war to repent . ''
Parsing [sent. 10655 len. 4]: `` Man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10656 len. 30]: exclaimed the stonemason , rising to his full height with slow labour after the day 's toil , `` it wad be cruel to gar _ him _ repent .
Parsing [sent. 10657 len. 8]: It wad be ower sair upon him .
Parsing [sent. 10658 len. 4]: Better kill him .
Parsing [sent. 10659 len. 11]: The bitterness o ' sic repentance wad be ower terrible .
Parsing [sent. 10660 len. 9]: It wad be mair nor he cud bide .
Parsing [sent. 10661 len. 9]: It wad brak his hert a ` thegither .
Parsing [sent. 10662 len. 11]: - Na , na , he has nae chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 10663 len. 16]: The last sentence was spoken quickly and with attempted carelessness as he resumed his seat .
Parsing [sent. 10664 len. 7]: `` Hoo ken ye that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10665 len. 3]: asked Cupples .
Parsing [sent. 10666 len. 13]: `` There 's no sic word i ' the Scriptur ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 10667 len. 15]: `` Do ye think He maun tell _ us _ a ' thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10668 len. 15]: `` We hae nae richt to think onything that He doesna tell 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 10669 len. 12]: `` I 'm nae sae sure o ' that , Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 10670 len. 31]: Maybe , whiles , he doesna tell 's a thing jist to gar 's think aboot it , and be ready for the time whan he will tell 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 10671 len. 8]: Thomas was silent for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 10672 len. 22]: Then with a smile - rather a grim one - he said , `` Here 's a curious thing , no .
Parsing [sent. 10673 len. 29]: - There 's neyther o ' you convertit , and yet yer words strenthen my hert as gin they cam frae the airt -LRB- region -RRB- aboon . ''
Parsing [sent. 10674 len. 21]: But his countenance changed , and he added hastily , `` It 's a mark o ' indwellin ' sin .
Parsing [sent. 10675 len. 19]: To the law and to the testimony - Gang awa ' and lat me to my prayers . ''
Parsing [sent. 10676 len. 25]: They obeyed ; for either they felt that nothing but his prayers would do , or they were awed , and dared not remain .
Parsing [sent. 10677 len. 5]: Mr Cupples could wait .
Parsing [sent. 10678 len. 4]: Thomas could not .
Parsing [sent. 10679 len. 12]: The Forlorn Hope of men must storm the walls of Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 10680 len. 28]: Amongst those who sit down at the gate till one shall come and open it , are to be found both the wise and the careless children .
Parsing [sent. 10681 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXXXIX .
Parsing [sent. 10682 len. 15]: Mr Cupples returned to his work , for the catalogue had to be printed .
Parsing [sent. 10683 len. 41]: The weeks and months passed on , and the time drew nigh when it would be no folly to watch the mail-coach in its pride of scarlet and gold , as possibly bearing the welcome letter announcing Alec 's return .
Parsing [sent. 10684 len. 23]: At length , one morning , Mrs Forbes said : `` We may look for him every day now , Annie . ''
Parsing [sent. 10685 len. 46]: She did not know with what a tender echo her words went roaming about in Annie 's bosom , awaking a thousand thought-birds in the twilight land of memory , which had tucked their heads under their wings to sleep , and thereby to live .
Parsing [sent. 10686 len. 11]: But the days went on and the hope was deferred .
Parsing [sent. 10687 len. 41]: The rush of the _ Sea-horse _ did not trouble the sands of the shallow bar , or sweep , with fiercely ramping figure-head , past the long pier-spike , stretching like the hand of welcome from the hospitable shore .
Parsing [sent. 10688 len. 104]: While they fancied her full-breasted sails , swelled as with sighs for home , bowing lordly over the submissive waters , the _ Sea-horse _ lay a frozen mass , changed by the might of the winds and the snow and the frost into the grotesque ice-gaunt phantom of a ship , through which , the winter long , the winds would go whistling and raving , crowding upon it the snow and the crystal icicles , all in the wild waste of the desert north , with no ear to hear the sadness , and no eye to behold the deathly beauty .
Parsing [sent. 10689 len. 12]: At length the hope deferred began to make the heart sick .
Parsing [sent. 10690 len. 40]: Dim anxiety passed into vague fear , and then deepened into dull conviction , over which ever and anon flickered a pale ghostly hope , like the _ fatuus _ over the swamp that has swallowed the unwary wanderer .
Parsing [sent. 10691 len. 55]: Each would find the other wistfully watching to read any thought that might have escaped the vigilance of its keeper , and come up from the dungeon of the heart to air itself on the terraces of the face ; and each would drop the glance hurriedly , as if caught in a fault .
Parsing [sent. 10692 len. 31]: But the moment came when their meeting eyes were fixed and they burst into tears , each accepting the other 's confession of hopeless grief as the seal and doom .
Parsing [sent. 10693 len. 13]: I will not follow them through the slow shadows of gathering fate .
Parsing [sent. 10694 len. 23]: I will not record the fancies that tormented them , or describe the blank that fell upon the duties of the day .
Parsing [sent. 10695 len. 35]: I will not tell how , as the winter drew on , they heard his voice calling in the storm for help , or how through the snow-drifts they saw him plodding wearily home .
Parsing [sent. 10696 len. 15]: His mother forgot her debt , and ceased to care what became of herself .
Parsing [sent. 10697 len. 19]: Annie 's anxiety settled into an earnest prayer that she might not rebel against the will of God .
Parsing [sent. 10698 len. 17]: But the anxiety of Thomas Crann was not limited to the earthly fate of the lad .
Parsing [sent. 10699 len. 90]: It extended to his fate in the other world - too probably , in his eyes , that endless , yearless , undivided fate , wherein the breath still breathed into the soul of man by his Maker is no longer the breath of life , but the breath of infinite death - Sole Positive of Night , Antipathist of Light , giving to the ideal darkness a real and individual hypostasis in helpless humanity , keeping men alive that the light in them may continue to be darkness .
Parsing [sent. 10700 len. 34]: Terrible were his agonies in wrestling with God for the life of the lad , and terrible his fear lest his own faith should fail him if his prayers should not be heard .
Parsing [sent. 10701 len. 43]: Alec Forbes was to Thomas Crann as it were the representative of all his unsaved brothers and sisters of the human race , for whose sakes he , like the apostle Paul , would have gladly undergone what he dreaded for them .
Parsing [sent. 10702 len. 16]: He went to see his mother ; said `` Hoo are ye , mem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10703 len. 24]: sat down ; never opened his lips , except to utter a few commonplaces ; rose and left her - a little comforted .
Parsing [sent. 10704 len. 19]: Nor can anything but human sympathy alleviate the pain while it obscures not the presence of human grief .
Parsing [sent. 10705 len. 10]: Do not remind me that the divine is better .
Parsing [sent. 10706 len. 4]: I know it .
Parsing [sent. 10707 len. 3]: But why ?
Parsing [sent. 10708 len. 12]: - Because the divine is the highest - the creative human .
Parsing [sent. 10709 len. 15]: The sympathy of the Lord himself is the more human that it is divine .
Parsing [sent. 10710 len. 42]: And in Annie 's face , as she ministered to her friend , shone , notwithstanding her full share in the sorrow , a light that came not from sun or stars - as it were a suppressed , waiting light .
Parsing [sent. 10711 len. 17]: And Mrs Forbes felt the holy influences that proceeded both from her and from Thomas Crann .
Parsing [sent. 10712 len. 29]: How much easier it is to bear a trouble that comes upon a trouble than one that intrudes a death 's head into the midst of a merry-making !
Parsing [sent. 10713 len. 71]: Mrs Forbes scarcely felt it a trouble when she received a note from Robert Bruce informing her that , as he was on the point of removing to another place which offered great advantages for the employment of the little money he possessed , he would be obliged to her to pay as soon as possible the hundred pounds she owed him , along with certain arrears of interest specified .
Parsing [sent. 10714 len. 17]: She wrote that it was impossible for her at present , and forgot the whole affair .
Parsing [sent. 10715 len. 17]: But within three days she received a formal application for the debt from a new solicitor .
Parsing [sent. 10716 len. 14]: To this she paid no attention , just wondering what would come next .
Parsing [sent. 10717 len. 55]: After about three months a second application was made , according to legal form ; and in the month of May a third arrived , with the hint from the lawyer that his client was now prepared to proceed to extremities ; whereupon she felt for the first time that she must do something .
Parsing [sent. 10718 len. 6]: She sent for James Dow .
Parsing [sent. 10719 len. 12]: `` Are you going to the market to-day , James ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10720 len. 4]: she asked . ''
Parsing [sent. 10721 len. 8]: ` Deed am I , mem . ''
Parsing [sent. 10722 len. 21]: `` Well , be sure and go into one of the tents , and have a good dinner . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 10723 len. 14]: ` Deed , mem , I 'll do naething o ' the sort .
Parsing [sent. 10724 len. 18]: It 's a sin and a shame to waste gude siller upo ' broth an ' beef .
Parsing [sent. 10725 len. 28]: I 'll jist pit a piece -LRB- of oatcake -RRB- in my pooch , and that 'll fess me hame as well 's a ' their kail .
Parsing [sent. 10726 len. 8]: I can bide onything but wastrie . ''
Parsing [sent. 10727 len. 11]: `` It 's very foolish of you , James . ''
Parsing [sent. 10728 len. 12]: `` It 's yer pleesur to say sae , mem . ''
Parsing [sent. 10729 len. 12]: `` Well , tell me what to do about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 10730 len. 7]: And she handed him the letter .
Parsing [sent. 10731 len. 8]: James took it and read it slowly .
Parsing [sent. 10732 len. 7]: Then he stared at his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 10733 len. 6]: Then he read it again .
Parsing [sent. 10734 len. 27]: At length , with a bewildered look , he said , `` Gin ye awe the siller , ye maun pay ` t , mem . ''
Parsing [sent. 10735 len. 7]: `` But I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 10736 len. 6]: `` The Lord preserve 's !
Parsing [sent. 10737 len. 6]: What 's to be dune ?
Parsing [sent. 10738 len. 18]: _ I _ hae bit thirty poun ' hained -LRB- saved -RRB- up i ' my kist .
Parsing [sent. 10739 len. 6]: That wadna gang far . ''
Parsing [sent. 10740 len. 12]: `` No , no , James , '' returned his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 10741 len. 15]: `` I am not going to take your money to pay Mr Bruce . ''
Parsing [sent. 10742 len. 11]: `` He 's an awfu ' cratur that , mem .
Parsing [sent. 10743 len. 16]: He wad tak the win ` in ' sheet aff o ' the deid . ''
Parsing [sent. 10744 len. 11]: `` Well , I must see what can be done .
Parsing [sent. 10745 len. 9]: I 'll go and consult Mr Gibb . ''
Parsing [sent. 10746 len. 17]: James took his leave , dejected on his mistress 's account , and on his own .
Parsing [sent. 10747 len. 9]: As he went out , he met Annie .
Parsing [sent. 10748 len. 6]: `` Eh , Annie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10749 len. 10]: he said ; `` this is awfu ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 10750 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , Dooie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10751 len. 34]: `` That schochlin ' -LRB- waddling , mean -RRB- cratur , Bruce , is mintin ' -LRB- threatening -RRB- at roupin ' the mistress for a wheen siller she 's aucht him . ''
Parsing [sent. 10752 len. 5]: `` He daurna ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10753 len. 3]: exclaimed Annie .
Parsing [sent. 10754 len. 12]: `` He 'll daur onything but tyne -LRB- lose -RRB- siller .
Parsing [sent. 10755 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 10756 len. 13]: lassie , gin we hadna len ' ' t him yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10757 len. 8]: `` I 'll gang till him direcly .
Parsing [sent. 10758 len. 6]: But dinna tell the mistress .
Parsing [sent. 10759 len. 6]: She wadna like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10760 len. 5]: `` Na , na .
Parsing [sent. 10761 len. 13]: I s ' haud my tongue , I s ' warran ' .
Parsing [sent. 10762 len. 10]: - Ye 're the best cratur ever was born .
Parsing [sent. 10763 len. 12]: She 'll maybe perswaud the ill-faured tyke -LRB- dog -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 10764 len. 12]: Murmuring the last two sentences to himself , he walked away .
Parsing [sent. 10765 len. 19]: When Annie entered Bruce 's shop , the big spider was unoccupied , and ready to devour her .
Parsing [sent. 10766 len. 9]: He put on therefore his most gracious reception .
Parsing [sent. 10767 len. 8]: `` Hoo are ye , Miss Anderson ?
Parsing [sent. 10768 len. 7]: I 'm glaid to see ye .
Parsing [sent. 10769 len. 6]: Come benn the hoose . ''
Parsing [sent. 10770 len. 7]: `` No , I thank ye .
Parsing [sent. 10771 len. 11]: I want to speak to yersel ' , Mr Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 10772 len. 12]: What 's a ' this aboot Mrs Forbes and you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10773 len. 19]: `` Grit fowk maunna ride ower the tap o ' puir fowk like me , Miss Anderson . ''
Parsing [sent. 10774 len. 29]: `` She 's a widow , Mr Bruce '' - Annie could not add `` and childless '' - `` and lays nae claim to be great fowk .
Parsing [sent. 10775 len. 13]: It 's no a Christian way o ' treatin ' her . ''
Parsing [sent. 10776 len. 9]: `` Fowk _ maun _ hae their ain .
Parsing [sent. 10777 len. 21]: It 's mine , and I maun hae ` t. There 's naething agen that i ' the ten tables .
Parsing [sent. 10778 len. 12]: There 's nae gospel for no giein ' fowk their ain .
Parsing [sent. 10779 len. 7]: I 'm nae a missionar noo .
Parsing [sent. 10780 len. 8]: I dinna haud wi ' sic things .
Parsing [sent. 10781 len. 12]: I canna beggar my faimily to haud up her muckle hoose .
Parsing [sent. 10782 len. 13]: She maun pay me , or I 'll tak ' it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10783 len. 35]: `` Gin ye do , Mr Bruce , ye s ' no hae my siller ae minute efter the time 's up ; and I 'm sorry ye hae ' t till than . ''
Parsing [sent. 10784 len. 8]: `` That 's neither here nor there .
Parsing [sent. 10785 len. 14]: Ye wad be wantin ' ' t or that time ony hoo . ''
Parsing [sent. 10786 len. 74]: Now Bruce had given up the notion of leaving Glamerton , for he had found that the patronage of the missionars in grocery was not essential to a certain measure of success ; and he had no intention of proceeding to an auction of Mrs Forbes 's goods , for he saw that would put him in a worse position with the public than any amount of quiet practice in lying and stealing .
Parsing [sent. 10787 len. 52]: But there was every likelihood of Annie 's being married some day ; and then her money would be recalled , and he would be left without the capital necessary for carrying on his business upon the same enlarged scale - seeing he now supplied many of the little country shops .
Parsing [sent. 10788 len. 39]: It would be a grand move then , if , by a far-sighted generalship , a careful copying of the example of his great ancestor , he could get a permanent hold of some of Annie 's property .
Parsing [sent. 10789 len. 16]: - Hence had come the descent upon Mrs Forbes , and here came its success .
Parsing [sent. 10790 len. 24]: `` Ye s ' hae as muckle o ' mine to yer nainsel ' as 'll clear Mrs Forbes , '' said Annie .
Parsing [sent. 10791 len. 3]: `` Weel .
Parsing [sent. 10792 len. 3]: Verra weel .
Parsing [sent. 10793 len. 16]: - But ye see that 's mine for twa year and a half ony gait .
Parsing [sent. 10794 len. 21]: That wad only amunt to losin ' her interest for twa year an ' a half - a ` thegither .
Parsing [sent. 10795 len. 5]: That winna do . ''
Parsing [sent. 10796 len. 11]: `` What will do , than , Mr Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10797 len. 5]: `` I dinna ken .
Parsing [sent. 10798 len. 6]: I want my ain . ''
Parsing [sent. 10799 len. 10]: `` But ye maunna torment her , Mr Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 10800 len. 5]: Ye ken that . ''
Parsing [sent. 10801 len. 3]: `` Weel !
Parsing [sent. 10802 len. 7]: I 'm open to onything rizzonable .
Parsing [sent. 10803 len. 40]: There 's the enterest for twa an ' a half - ca ' ' t three years - at what I could mak ' o ' ` t - say aucht per cent - four and twenty poun ' .
Parsing [sent. 10804 len. 39]: Syne there 's her arrears o ' interest - and syne there 's the loss o ' the ower-turn - and syne there 's the loss o ' the siller that ye winna hae to len ' me .
Parsing [sent. 10805 len. 23]: - Gin ye gie me a quittance for a hunner an ' fifty poun ' , I 'll gie her a receipt .
Parsing [sent. 10806 len. 11]: - It 'll be a sair loss to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10807 len. 9]: `` Onything ye like , '' said Annie .
Parsing [sent. 10808 len. 21]: And Bruce brought out papers already written by his lawyer , one of which he signed and the other she .
Parsing [sent. 10809 len. 36]: `` Ye 'll min ' , '' he added , as she was leaving the shop , `` that I hae to pay ye no interest noo excep ' upo ' fifty poun ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10810 len. 13]: He had paid her nothing for the last half year at least .
Parsing [sent. 10811 len. 34]: He would not have dared to fleece the girl thus , had she had any legally constituted guardians ; or had those who would gladly have interfered , had power to protect her .
Parsing [sent. 10812 len. 31]: But he took care so to word the quittance , that in the event of any thing going wrong , he might yet claim his hundred pounds from Mrs Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 10813 len. 17]: Annie read over the receipt , and saw that she had involved herself in a difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 10814 len. 7]: How would Mrs Forbes take it ?
Parsing [sent. 10815 len. 16]: She begged Bruce not to tell her , and he was ready enough to consent .
Parsing [sent. 10816 len. 4]: He did more .
Parsing [sent. 10817 len. 64]: He wrote to Mrs Forbes to the effect that , upon reflection , he had resolved to drop further proceedings for the present ; and when she carried him a half-year 's interest , he took it in silence , justifying himself on the ground that the whole transaction was of doubtful success , and he must therefore secure what he could secure .
Parsing [sent. 10818 len. 28]: As may well be supposed , Annie had very little money to give away now ; and this subjected her to a quite new sense of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 10819 len. 3]: CHAPTER XC .
Parsing [sent. 10820 len. 11]: It was a dreary wintry summer to all at Howglen .
Parsing [sent. 10821 len. 42]: Why should the ripe corn wave deep-dyed in the gold of the sunbeams , when Alec lay frozen in the fields of ice , or sweeping about under them like a broken sea-weed in the waters so cold , so mournful ?
Parsing [sent. 10822 len. 10]: Yet the work of the world must go on .
Parsing [sent. 10823 len. 6]: The corn must be reaped .
Parsing [sent. 10824 len. 7]: Things must be bought and sold .
Parsing [sent. 10825 len. 8]: Even the mourners must eat and drink .
Parsing [sent. 10826 len. 41]: The stains which the day had gathered must be washed from the brow of the morning ; and the dust to which Alec had gone down must be swept from the chair in which he had been wont to sit .
Parsing [sent. 10827 len. 34]: So things did go on - of themselves as it were , for no one cared much about them , although it was the finest harvest that year that Howglen had ever borne .
Parsing [sent. 10828 len. 66]: It had begun at length to appear that the old labour had not been cast into a dead grave , but into a living soil , like that of which Sir Philip Sidney says in his sixty-fifth psalm : `` Each clodd relenteth at thy dressing , '' as if it were a human soul that had bethought itself and began to bring forth fruit .
Parsing [sent. 10829 len. 10]: - This might be the beginning of good things .
Parsing [sent. 10830 len. 6]: But what did it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 10831 len. 15]: Annie grew paler , but relaxed not a single effort to fill her place .
Parsing [sent. 10832 len. 70]: She told her poor friends that she had no money now , and could not help them ; but most were nearly as glad to see her as before ; while one of them who had never liked receiving alms from a girl in such a lowly position , as well as some who had always taken them thankfully , loved her better when she had nothing to give .
Parsing [sent. 10833 len. 25]: She renewed her acquaintance with Peter Whaup , the blacksmith , through his wife , who was ill , and received her visits gladly .
Parsing [sent. 10834 len. 63]: `` For , '' she said , `` she 's a fine douce lass , and speyks to ye as gin ye war ither fowk , and no as gin she kent a ` thing , and cam to tell ye the muckle half o ' ` t. '' I wonder how much her friends understood of what she read to them ?
Parsing [sent. 10835 len. 43]: She did not confine herself to the Bible , which indeed she was a little shy of reading except they wanted it , but read anything that pleased herself , never doubting that `` ither fowk '' could enjoy what she enjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 10836 len. 34]: She even tried the _ Paradise Lost _ upon Mrs Whaup , as she had tried it long ago upon Tibbie Dyster ; and Mrs Whaup never seemed tired of listening to it .
Parsing [sent. 10837 len. 21]: I daresay she understood about as much of it as poets do of the celestial harmonies ever toning around them .
Parsing [sent. 10838 len. 37]: And Peter Whaup was once known , when more than half drunk , to stop his swearing in mid-volley , simply because he had caught a glimpse of Annie at the other end of the street .
Parsing [sent. 10839 len. 7]: So the maiden grew in favour .
Parsing [sent. 10840 len. 38]: Her beauty , both inward and outward , was that of the twilight , of a morning cloudy with high clouds , or of a silvery sea : it was a spiritual beauty for the most part .
Parsing [sent. 10841 len. 21]: And her sorrow gave a quiet grace to her demeanour , peacefully ripening it into what is loveliest in ladyhood .
Parsing [sent. 10842 len. 22]: She always looked like one waiting - sometimes like one listening , as she waited , to `` melodies unheard . ''
Parsing [sent. 10843 len. 3]: CHAPTER XCI .
Parsing [sent. 10844 len. 41]: One night , in the end of October , James Dow was walking by the side of his cart along a lonely road , through a peat-moss , on his way to the nearest sea-port for a load of coals .
Parsing [sent. 10845 len. 7]: The moon was high and full .
Parsing [sent. 10846 len. 13]: He was approaching a solitary milestone in the midst of the moss .
Parsing [sent. 10847 len. 6]: It was the loneliest place .
Parsing [sent. 10848 len. 69]: Low swells of peat-ground , the burial places of old forests , rolled away on every side , with , here and there , patches of the white-bearded canna-down , or cotton-grass , glimmering doubtfully as the Wind woke and turned himself on the wide space , where he found nothing to puff at but those same little old fairies sunning their hoary beards in the strange moon .
Parsing [sent. 10849 len. 16]: As Dow drew near to the milestone he saw an odd-looking figure seated upon it .
Parsing [sent. 10850 len. 27]: He was about to ask him if he would like a lift , when the figure rose , and cried joyfully , `` Jamie Doo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10851 len. 23]: James Dow staggered back , and was nearly thrown down by the slow-rolling wheel ; for the voice was Alec Forbes 's .
Parsing [sent. 10852 len. 34]: He gasped for breath , and felt as if he were recovering from a sudden stroke of paralysis , during which everything about him had passed away and a new order come in .
Parsing [sent. 10853 len. 12]: All that he was capable of was to cry _ wo !
Parsing [sent. 10854 len. 5]: _ to his horse .
Parsing [sent. 10855 len. 21]: There stood Alec , in rags , with a face thin but brown - healthy , bold , and firm .
Parsing [sent. 10856 len. 11]: He looked ten years older standing there in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 10857 len. 7]: `` The Lord preserve 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10858 len. 9]: cried Dow , and could say no more .
Parsing [sent. 10859 len. 11]: `` He has preserved me , ye see , Jeamie .
Parsing [sent. 10860 len. 6]: Hoo 's my mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10861 len. 10]: `` She 's brawly , brawly , Mr Alec .
Parsing [sent. 10862 len. 5]: The Lord preserve 's !
Parsing [sent. 10863 len. 7]: She 's been terrible aboot ye .
Parsing [sent. 10864 len. 8]: Ye maunna gang in upo ' her .
Parsing [sent. 10865 len. 6]: It wad kill her . ''
Parsing [sent. 10866 len. 10]: `` I hae a grainy sense left , Jeamie .
Parsing [sent. 10867 len. 7]: But I 'm awfu ' tired .
Parsing [sent. 10868 len. 12]: Ye maun jist turn yer cairt and tak ' me hame .
Parsing [sent. 10869 len. 15]: I 'll be worth a lade o ' coal to my mither ony gait .
Parsing [sent. 10870 len. 11]: An ' syne ye can brak it till her . ''
Parsing [sent. 10871 len. 46]: Without another word , Dow turned his horse , helped Alec into the cart , covered him with his coat and some straw , and strode away beside , not knowing whether he was walking in a dream , or in a real starry night .
Parsing [sent. 10872 len. 23]: Alec fell fast asleep , and never waked till the cart stood still , about midnight , at his mother 's door .
Parsing [sent. 10873 len. 4]: He started up .
Parsing [sent. 10874 len. 15]: `` Lie still , Mr Alec , '' said Dow , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 10875 len. 9]: `` The mistress 'll be in her bed .
Parsing [sent. 10876 len. 18]: And gin ye gang in upo ' her that gait , ye 'll drive her daft . ''
Parsing [sent. 10877 len. 24]: Alec lay down again , and Dow went to Mary 's window , on the other side , to try to wake her .
Parsing [sent. 10878 len. 14]: But just as he returned , Alec heard his mother 's window open .
Parsing [sent. 10879 len. 6]: `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10880 len. 3]: she called .
Parsing [sent. 10881 len. 12]: `` Naebody but me , Jeamie Doo , '' answered James .
Parsing [sent. 10882 len. 17]: `` I was half-gaits to Portlokie , whan I had a mishap upo ' the road .
Parsing [sent. 10883 len. 20]: Bettie pat her fit upon a sharp stane , and fell doon , and bruik baith her legs . ''
Parsing [sent. 10884 len. 9]: `` How did she come home then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10885 len. 10]: `` She bude to come hame , mem . ''
Parsing [sent. 10886 len. 6]: `` Broke her legs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10887 len. 8]: `` Hoot , mem - her k-nees .
Parsing [sent. 10888 len. 15]: I dinna mean the banes , ye ken , mem ; only the skin .
Parsing [sent. 10889 len. 8]: But she wasna fit to gang on .
Parsing [sent. 10890 len. 8]: And sae I brocht her back . ''
Parsing [sent. 10891 len. 9]: `` What 's that i ' the cairt ?
Parsing [sent. 10892 len. 7]: Is ' t onything deid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10893 len. 13]: `` Na , mem , de'il a bit o ' ` t !
Parsing [sent. 10894 len. 6]: It 's livin ' eneuch .
Parsing [sent. 10895 len. 16]: It 's a stranger lad that I gae a lift till upo ' the road .
Parsing [sent. 10896 len. 6]: He 's fell tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 10897 len. 20]: But Dow 's voice trembled , or - or something or other revealed all to the mother 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 10898 len. 6]: She gave a great cry .
Parsing [sent. 10899 len. 19]: Alec sprung from the cart , rushed into the house , and was in his mother 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 10900 len. 19]: Annie was asleep in the next room , but she half awoke with a sense of his presence .
Parsing [sent. 10901 len. 11]: She had heard his voice through the folds of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 10902 len. 36]: And she thought she was lying on the rug before the dining-room fire , with Alec and his mother at the tea-table , as on that night when he brought her in from the snow-hut .
Parsing [sent. 10903 len. 40]: Finding out confusedly that the supposition did not correspond with some other vague consciousness , she supposed next that she `` had died in sleep and was a blessed ghost , '' just going to find Alec in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 10904 len. 34]: That was abandoned in its turn , and all at once she knew that she was in her own bed , and that Alec and his mother were talking in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 10905 len. 11]: She rose , but could hardly dress herself for trembling .
Parsing [sent. 10906 len. 17]: When she was dressed she sat down on the edge of the bed to bethink herself .
Parsing [sent. 10907 len. 16]: The joy was almost torture , but it had a certain qualifying bitter in it .
Parsing [sent. 10908 len. 16]: Ever since she had believed him dead , Alec had been so near to her !
Parsing [sent. 10909 len. 11]: She had loved him as much as ever she would .
Parsing [sent. 10910 len. 15]: But Life had come in suddenly , and divided those whom Death had joined .
Parsing [sent. 10911 len. 23]: Now he was a great way off ; and she dared not speak to him whom she had cherished in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 10912 len. 23]: Modesty took the telescope from the hands of Love , and turning it , put the larger end to Annie 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 10913 len. 58]: Ever since her confession to Curly , she had been making fresh discoveries in her own heart ; and now the tide of her love swelled so strong that she felt it must break out in an agony of joy , and betray her if once she looked in the face of Alec alive from the dead .
Parsing [sent. 10914 len. 5]: Nor was this all .
Parsing [sent. 10915 len. 44]: What she had done about his mother 's debt , must come out soon ; and although Alec could not think that she meant to lay him under obligation , he might yet feel under obligation , and that she could not bear .
Parsing [sent. 10916 len. 53]: These things and many more so worked in the sensitive maiden that as soon as she heard Alec and his mother go to the dining-room she put on her bonnet and cloak , stole like a thief through the house to the back door , and let herself out into the night .
Parsing [sent. 10917 len. 39]: She avoided the path , and went through the hedge into a field of stubble at the back of the house across which she made her way to the turnpike road and the new bridge over the Glamour .
Parsing [sent. 10918 len. 48]: Often she turned to look back to the window of the room where he that had been dead was alive and talking with his widowed mother ; and only when the intervening trees hid it from her sight did she begin to think what she should do .
Parsing [sent. 10919 len. 26]: She could think of nothing but to go to her aunt once more , and ask her to take her in for a few days .
Parsing [sent. 10920 len. 9]: So she walked on through the sleeping town .
Parsing [sent. 10921 len. 12]: Not a soul was awake , and the stillness was awful .
Parsing [sent. 10922 len. 7]: It was a place of tombs .
Parsing [sent. 10923 len. 8]: And those tombs were haunted by dreams .
Parsing [sent. 10924 len. 49]: Away towards the west , the moon lay on the steep-sloping edge of a rugged cloud , appearing to have rolled half-way down from its lofty peak , and about to be launched off its baseless bulk into `` the empty , vast , and wandering air . ''
Parsing [sent. 10925 len. 19]: In the middle of the large square of the little gray town she stood and looked around her .
Parsing [sent. 10926 len. 18]: All one side lay in shade ; the greater part of the other three lay in moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 10927 len. 38]: The old growth of centuries , gables and fronts - stepping out into the light , retreating into the shadow - outside stairs and dark gateways , stood up in the night warding a townful of sleepers .
Parsing [sent. 10928 len. 7]: Not one would be awake now .
Parsing [sent. 10929 len. 3]: Ah yes !
Parsing [sent. 10930 len. 9]: there was light in the wool-carder 's window .
Parsing [sent. 10931 len. 5]: His wife was dying .
Parsing [sent. 10932 len. 29]: That light over the dying , wiped the death-look from the face of the sleeping town , Annie roused herself and passed on , fearing to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 10933 len. 10]: It was the only thing to be afraid of .
Parsing [sent. 10934 len. 6]: But the stillness was awful .
Parsing [sent. 10935 len. 14]: One silence only could be more awful : the same silence at noon-day .
Parsing [sent. 10936 len. 19]: So she passed into the western road and through the trees to the bridge over the Wan Water .
Parsing [sent. 10937 len. 8]: They stood so still in the moonlight !
Parsing [sent. 10938 len. 48]: And the smell from the withering fields laid bare of the harvest and breathing out their damp odours , came to her mixed with the chill air from the dark hills around , already spiced with keen atoms of frost , soon to appear in spangly spikes .
Parsing [sent. 10939 len. 65]: Beneath the bridge the river flowed maunderingly , blundering out unintelligible news of its parent bog and all the dreary places it had come through on its way to the strath of Glamerton , which nobody listened to but one glad-hearted , puzzle-brained girl , who stood looking down into it from the bridge when she ought to have been in bed and asleep .
Parsing [sent. 10940 len. 27]: She was not far from Clippenstrae , but she could not go there so early , for her aunt would be frightened first and angry next .
Parsing [sent. 10941 len. 20]: So she wandered up the stream to the old church-forsaken churchyard , and sat on one of the tombstones .
Parsing [sent. 10942 len. 10]: It became very cold as the morning drew on .
Parsing [sent. 10943 len. 49]: The moon went down ; the stars grew dim ; the river ran with a livelier murmur ; and through all the fine gradations of dawn - cloudy wind and grey sky - the gates of orange and red burst open , and the sun came forth rejoicing .
Parsing [sent. 10944 len. 6]: The long night was over .
Parsing [sent. 10945 len. 47]: It had not been a very weary one ; for Annie had thoughts of her own , and like the earth in the warm summer nights , could shine and flash up through the dark , seeking the face of God in the altar-flame of prayer .
Parsing [sent. 10946 len. 9]: Yet she was glad when the sun came .
Parsing [sent. 10947 len. 74]: With the first bubble of the spring of light bursting out on the hill-top , she rose and walked through the long shadows of the graves down to the river and through the long shadows of the stubble down the side of the river , which shone in the morning light like a flowing crystal of delicate brown - and so to Clippenstrae , where she found her aunt still in her night-cap .
Parsing [sent. 10948 len. 32]: She was standing at the door , however , shading her eyes with her hand , looking abroad as if for some one that might be crossing hitherward from the east .
Parsing [sent. 10949 len. 10]: She did not see Annie approaching from the north .
Parsing [sent. 10950 len. 11]: `` What are ye luikin ' for , auntie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10951 len. 3]: `` Naething .
Parsing [sent. 10952 len. 10]: Nae for you , ony gait , lassie . ''
Parsing [sent. 10953 len. 13]: `` Weel , ye see , I 'm come ohn luikit for .
Parsing [sent. 10954 len. 11]: But ye was luikin ' for somebody , auntie . ''
Parsing [sent. 10955 len. 3]: `` Na .
Parsing [sent. 10956 len. 8]: I was only jist luikin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 10957 len. 68]: Even Annie did not then know that it was the soul 's hunger , the vague sense of a need which nothing but the God of human faces , the God of the morning and of the starful night , the God of love and self-forgetfulness , can satisfy , that sent her money-loving , poverty-stricken , pining , grumbling old aunt out staring towards the east .
Parsing [sent. 10958 len. 30]: It is this formless idea of something at hand that keeps men and women striving to tear from the bosom of the world the secret of their own hopes .
Parsing [sent. 10959 len. 14]: How little they know what they look for in reality is their God !
Parsing [sent. 10960 len. 13]: This is that for which their heart and their flesh cry out .
Parsing [sent. 10961 len. 9]: Lead , lead me on , my Hopes .
Parsing [sent. 10962 len. 10]: I know that ye are true and not vain .
Parsing [sent. 10963 len. 14]: Vanish from my eyes day after day , but arise in new forms .
Parsing [sent. 10964 len. 46]: I will follow your holy deception ; - follow till ye have brought me to the feet of my Father in Heaven , where I shall find you all with folded wings spangling the sapphire dusk whereon stands His throne , which is our home .
Parsing [sent. 10965 len. 14]: `` What do ye want sae ear 's this , Annie Anderson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10966 len. 17]: Margaret 's first thought was always - `` What can the body be wantin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10967 len. 17]: `` I want ye to tak ' me in for a while , '' answered Annie .
Parsing [sent. 10968 len. 7]: `` For an hoor or twa ?
Parsing [sent. 10969 len. 4]: Ow ay . ''
Parsing [sent. 10970 len. 3]: `` Na .
Parsing [sent. 10971 len. 9]: For a week or twa maybe . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 10972 len. 4]: ` Deed no .
Parsing [sent. 10973 len. 23]: I 'll do naething o ' the kin ' , Lat them ` at made ye prood , keep ye prood . ''
Parsing [sent. 10974 len. 8]: `` I 'm nae prood , auntie .
Parsing [sent. 10975 len. 7]: What gars ye say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10976 len. 20]: `` Sae prood ` at ye wadna tak ' a gude offer whan it was i ' yer pooer .
Parsing [sent. 10977 len. 11]: And syne they turn ye oot whan it shuits themsels .
Parsing [sent. 10978 len. 10]: Gentle fowks is sair misca 'd -LRB- misnamed -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 10979 len. 11]: I 'm no gaein ' to tak ' ye in .
Parsing [sent. 10980 len. 8]: There 's Dawvid Gordon wants a lass .
Parsing [sent. 10981 len. 12]: Ye can jist gang till a place like ither fowk . ''
Parsing [sent. 10982 len. 11]: `` I 'll gang and luik efter ' t direckly .
Parsing [sent. 10983 len. 9]: Hoo far is ` t , Auntie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10984 len. 30]: `` Gaein ' and giein ' awa ' yer siller to beggars as gin ' t war stew -LRB- dust -RRB- , jist to be a gran ' lady !
Parsing [sent. 10985 len. 14]: Ye 're nane sae gran ' , _ I _ can tell ye .
Parsing [sent. 10986 len. 21]: An ' syne comin ' to puir fowk like me to tak ' ye in for a week or twa !
Parsing [sent. 10987 len. 5]: Weel I wat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10988 len. 18]: Auntie had been listening to evil tongues - so much easier to listen to than just tongues .
Parsing [sent. 10989 len. 8]: With difficulty Annie kept back her tears .
Parsing [sent. 10990 len. 20]: She made no defence ; tried to eat the porridge which her aunt set before her ; and departed .
Parsing [sent. 10991 len. 28]: Before three hours were over , she had the charge of the dairy and cooking at Willowcraig for the next six months of coming winter and spring .
Parsing [sent. 10992 len. 28]: Protected from suspicion , her spirits rose all the cheerier for their temporary depression , and she went singing about the house like a _ lintie _ .
Parsing [sent. 10993 len. 44]: `` As she did not appear at breakfast , and was absent from the dinner-table as well , Mrs Forbes set out with Alec to inquire after her , and not knowing where else to go first , betook herself to Robert Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 10994 len. 38]: He showed more surprise than pleasure at seeing Alec , smiling with his own acridness as he said , `` I doobt ye haena brocht hame that barrel o ' ile ye promised me , Mr Alec ?
Parsing [sent. 10995 len. 16]: It wad hae cleared aff a guid sheave o ' yer mither 's debts . ''
Parsing [sent. 10996 len. 21]: Alec answered cheerily , although his face flushed , `` All in good time , I hope , Mr Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 10997 len. 12]: I 'm obliged to you for your forbearance , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 10998 len. 8]: He was too solemn-glad to be angry .
Parsing [sent. 10999 len. 27]: `` It canna laist for ever , ye ken , '' rejoined Bruce , happy to be able to bite , although his poison-bag was gone .
Parsing [sent. 11000 len. 5]: Alec made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 11001 len. 12]: `` Have you seen Annie Anderson to-day , Mr Bruce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11002 len. 5]: asked his mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 11003 len. 6]: ` Deed no , mem .
Parsing [sent. 11004 len. 10]: She doesna aften trouble huz wi ' her company .
Parsing [sent. 11005 len. 10]: We 're no gran ' eneuch for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 11006 len. 9]: `` Has n't she been here to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11007 len. 12]: repeated Mrs Forbes , with discomposure in her look and tone .
Parsing [sent. 11008 len. 9]: `` Hae ye tint her , mem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11009 len. 3]: rejoined Bruce .
Parsing [sent. 11010 len. 8]: `` That _ is _ a peety .
Parsing [sent. 11011 len. 13]: She 'll be awa ' wi ' that vaigabone , Willie Macwha .
Parsing [sent. 11012 len. 9]: He was i ' the toon last nicht .
Parsing [sent. 11013 len. 11]: I saw him gang by wi ' Baubie Peterson . ''
Parsing [sent. 11014 len. 31]: They made him no reply , understanding well enough that though the one premise might be true , the conclusion must be as false as it was illogical and spiteful .
Parsing [sent. 11015 len. 15]: They did not go to George Macwha 's , but set out for Clippenstrae .
Parsing [sent. 11016 len. 15]: When they reached the cottage , they found Meg 's nose in full vigour .
Parsing [sent. 11017 len. 3]: `` Na .
Parsing [sent. 11018 len. 5]: She 's no here .
Parsing [sent. 11019 len. 7]: What for sud she be here ?
Parsing [sent. 11020 len. 34]: She has no claim upo ' me , although it pleases you to turn her oot - efter bringin ' her up to notions that hae jist ruined her wi ' pride . ''
Parsing [sent. 11021 len. 13]: `` Indeed I did n't turn her out , Miss Anderson . ''
Parsing [sent. 11022 len. 12]: `` Weel , ye sud never hae taen her in . ''
Parsing [sent. 11023 len. 36]: There was something in her manner which made them certain she knew where Annie was ; but as she avoided every attempt to draw her into the admission , they departed foiled , although relieved .
Parsing [sent. 11024 len. 24]: She knew well enough that Annie 's refuge could not long remain concealed , but she found it pleasant to annoy Mrs Forbes .
Parsing [sent. 11025 len. 14]: And not many days passed before Mrs Forbes did learn where Annie was .
Parsing [sent. 11026 len. 42]: But she was so taken up with her son , that weeks even passed before that part of her nature which needed a daughter 's love began to assert itself again , and turn longingly towards her all but adopted child .
Parsing [sent. 11027 len. 10]: Alec went away once more to the great town .
Parsing [sent. 11028 len. 37]: He had certain remnants of study to gather up at the university , and a certain experience to go through in the preparation of drugs , without which he could not obtain his surgeon 's diploma .
Parsing [sent. 11029 len. 28]: The good harvest would by and by put a little money in his mother 's hands , and the sooner he was ready to practise the better .
Parsing [sent. 11030 len. 16]: The very day after he went , Mrs Forbes drove to Willowcraig to see Annie .
Parsing [sent. 11031 len. 15]: She found her short-coated and short-wrappered , like any other girl at a farmhouse .
Parsing [sent. 11032 len. 11]: Annie was rather embarrassed at the sight of her friend .
Parsing [sent. 11033 len. 19]: Mrs Forbes could easily see , however , that there was no breach in her affection towards her .
Parsing [sent. 11034 len. 39]: Yet it must be confessed that having regard to the final return of her son , she was quite as well pleased to know that she was bound to remain where she was for some time to come .
Parsing [sent. 11035 len. 11]: She found the winter very dreary without her , though .
Parsing [sent. 11036 len. 3]: CHARTER XCII .
Parsing [sent. 11037 len. 16]: Finding herself in good quarters , Annie re-engaged herself at the end of the half-year .
Parsing [sent. 11038 len. 59]: She had spent the winter in house work , combined with the feeding of pigs and poultry , and partial ministrations to the wants of the cows , of which she had milked the few continuing to give milk upon turnips and straw , and made the best of their scanty supply for the use of the household .
Parsing [sent. 11039 len. 9]: There was no hardship in her present life .
Parsing [sent. 11040 len. 16]: She had plenty of wholesome food to eat , and she lay warm at night .
Parsing [sent. 11041 len. 45]: The old farmer , who was rather overbearing with his men , was kind to her because he liked her ; and the guidwife was a sonsy -LRB- well conditioned -RRB- dame , who , when she scolded , never meant anything by it .
Parsing [sent. 11042 len. 16]: She cherished her love for Alec , but was quite peaceful as to the future .
Parsing [sent. 11043 len. 25]: How she might have felt had she heard that he was going to be married , I can not take upon me to say .
Parsing [sent. 11044 len. 44]: When her work was done , she would go out for a lonely walk , without asking leave or giving offence , indulging in the same lawlessness as before , and seeming incapable of being restrained by other bonds than those of duty .
Parsing [sent. 11045 len. 22]: And now the month of April was nearly over , and the primroses were _ glintin ' _ on the braes .
Parsing [sent. 11046 len. 32]: One evening she went out bare-headed to look how a certain den , wont to be haunted by wild-flowers and singing-birds , was getting on towards its complement of summer pleasures .
Parsing [sent. 11047 len. 18]: As she was climbing over a fence , a horseman came round the corner of the road .
Parsing [sent. 11048 len. 15]: She saw at a glance that it was Alec , and got down again .
Parsing [sent. 11049 len. 9]: Change had passed upon both since they parted .
Parsing [sent. 11050 len. 10]: He was a full-grown man with a settled look .
Parsing [sent. 11051 len. 17]: She was a lovely woman , even more delicate and graceful than her childhood had promised .
Parsing [sent. 11052 len. 15]: As she got down from the fence , he got down from his horse .
Parsing [sent. 11053 len. 44]: Without a word on either side , their hands joined , and still they stood silent for a minute , Annie with her eyes on the ground , Alec gazing in her face , which was pale with more than its usual paleness .
Parsing [sent. 11054 len. 21]: `` I saw Curly yesterday , '' said Alec at length , with what seemed to Annie a meaning look .
Parsing [sent. 11055 len. 8]: Her face flushed as red as fire .
Parsing [sent. 11056 len. 7]: - Could Curly have betrayed her ?
Parsing [sent. 11057 len. 9]: She managed to stammer out , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11058 len. 3]: Did you ?
Parsing [sent. 11059 len. 6]: And then silence fell again .
Parsing [sent. 11060 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 11061 len. 28]: Alec , '' she said at length , taking up the conversation , in her turn , `` we thought we would never see ye again . ''
Parsing [sent. 11062 len. 36]: `` I thought so too , '' answered Alec , `` when the great berg came down on us through the snow-storm , and flung the barque upon the floe with her side crushed in .
Parsing [sent. 11063 len. 20]: - How I used to dream about the old school-days , Annie , and finding you in my hut !
Parsing [sent. 11064 len. 13]: - And I did find you in the snow , Annie . ''
Parsing [sent. 11065 len. 30]: But a figure came round the other corner - for the road made a double sweep at this point - and cried - `` Annie , come hame direcly .
Parsing [sent. 11066 len. 5]: Ye 're wantit . ''
Parsing [sent. 11067 len. 16]: `` I 'm coming to see you again soon , Annie , '' said Alec .
Parsing [sent. 11068 len. 14]: `` But I must go away for a mouth or two first . ''
Parsing [sent. 11069 len. 13]: Annie replied with a smile and an outstretched hand - nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 11070 len. 6]: She could wait well enough .
Parsing [sent. 11071 len. 15]: How lovely the flowers in the dyke-sides looked as she followed Mrs Gordon home !
Parsing [sent. 11072 len. 17]: But the thought that perhaps Curly had told him something was like the serpent under them .
Parsing [sent. 11073 len. 30]: Yet somehow she had got so beautiful before she reached the house , that her aunt , who had come to see her , called out , `` Losh !
Parsing [sent. 11074 len. 2]: lassie !
Parsing [sent. 11075 len. 6]: What hae ye been aboot ?
Parsing [sent. 11076 len. 9]: Ye hae a colour by ordinar ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 11077 len. 13]: `` That 's easy accoontet for , '' said her mistress roguishly .
Parsing [sent. 11078 len. 19]: `` She was stan ` in ' killoguin wi ' a bonnie young lad an ' a horse .
Parsing [sent. 11079 len. 18]: I winna hae sic doin 's aboot my hoose , I can tell ye , lass . ''
Parsing [sent. 11080 len. 26]: Margaret Anderson flew into a passion , and abused her with many words , which Annie , so far from resenting , scarcely even heard .
Parsing [sent. 11081 len. 12]: At length she ceased , and departed almost without an adieu .
Parsing [sent. 11082 len. 6]: But what did it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 11083 len. 16]: - What did any earthly thing matter , if only Curly had not told him ?
Parsing [sent. 11084 len. 17]: Now , all that Curly had told Alec was that Annie was not engaged to him .
Parsing [sent. 11085 len. 27]: So the days and nights passed , and Spring , the girl , changed into Summer , the woman ; and still Alec did not come .
Parsing [sent. 11086 len. 94]: One evening , when a wind that blew from the west , and seemed to smell of the roses of the sunset , was filling her rosy heart with joy - Annie sat in a rough little seat , scarcely an arbour , at the bottom of a garden of the true country order , where all the dear old-fashioned glories of sweet-peas , cabbage-roses , larkspur , gardener 's garters , honesty , poppies , and peonies , grew in homely companionship with gooseberry and currant bushes , with potatoes and pease .
Parsing [sent. 11087 len. 34]: The scent of the sunset came in reality from a _ cheval de frise _ of wallflower on the coping of the low stone wall behind where she was sitting with her Milton .
Parsing [sent. 11088 len. 23]: She read aloud in a low voice that sonnet beginning '' _ Lady that in the prime of earliest youth _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 11089 len. 26]: As she finished it , a voice , as low , said , almost in her ear , `` That 's you , Annie . ''
Parsing [sent. 11090 len. 10]: Alec was looking over the garden wall behind her .
Parsing [sent. 11091 len. 25]: `` Eh , Alec , '' she cried , starting to her feet , at once shocked and delighted , `` dinna say that .
Parsing [sent. 11092 len. 12]: It 's dreidfu ' to hear ye say sic a thing .
Parsing [sent. 11093 len. 10]: I wish I was a wee like her . ''
Parsing [sent. 11094 len. 13]: `` Weel , Annie , I think ye 're jist like her .
Parsing [sent. 11095 len. 7]: But come oot wi ' me .
Parsing [sent. 11096 len. 8]: I hae a story to tell ye .
Parsing [sent. 11097 len. 16]: Gie me yer han ' , and pit yer fit upo ' the seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 11098 len. 28]: She was over the wall in a moment , and they were soon seated under the trees of the copse near which Annie had met him before .
Parsing [sent. 11099 len. 36]: The brown twilight was coming on , and a warm sleepy hush pervaded earth and air , broken only by the stream below them , cantering away over its stones to join the Wan Water .
Parsing [sent. 11100 len. 36]: Neither of them was inclined to quarrel with the treeless country about them : they were lapped in foliage ; nor with the desolate moorland hills around them : they only drove them closer together .
Parsing [sent. 11101 len. 8]: Time unmeasured by either passed without speech .
Parsing [sent. 11102 len. 24]: `` They tell ' t me , '' said Alec at length , `` that you and Curly had made it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 11103 len. 4]: `` Alec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11104 len. 29]: exclaimed Annie , and looked up in his face as if he had accused her of infidelity , but , instantly dropping her eyes , said no more .
Parsing [sent. 11105 len. 22]: `` I wad hae fun ' ye oot afore a day was ower , gin it hadna been for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 11106 len. 21]: Annie 's heart beat violently , but she said nothing , and , after a silence , Alec went on .
Parsing [sent. 11107 len. 15]: `` Did my mother ever tell ye about how the barque was lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11108 len. 6]: `` No , Alec . ''
Parsing [sent. 11109 len. 9]: `` It was a terrible snow-storm with wind .
Parsing [sent. 11110 len. 11]: We could n't see more than a few yards a-head .
Parsing [sent. 11111 len. 14]: We were under bare poles , but we could n't keep from drifting .
Parsing [sent. 11112 len. 35]: All in a moment a huge ghastly thing came out of the gloamin ' to windward , bore down on us like a spectre , and dashed us on a floating field of ice .
Parsing [sent. 11113 len. 18]: The barque was thrown right upon it with one side stove in ; but nobody was killed .
Parsing [sent. 11114 len. 20]: It was an awful night , Annie ; but I 'm not going to tell you about it now .
Parsing [sent. 11115 len. 35]: We made a rough sledge , and loaded it with provisions , and set out westward , and were carried westward at the same time on the floe , till we came near land .
Parsing [sent. 11116 len. 13]: Then we launched our boat and got to the shore of Greenland .
Parsing [sent. 11117 len. 7]: There we set out travelling southwards .
Parsing [sent. 11118 len. 15]: Many of our men died , do what I could to keep them alive .
Parsing [sent. 11119 len. 17]: But I 'll tell you all about it another time , if you 'll let me .
Parsing [sent. 11120 len. 10]: What I want to tell you noo 's this .
Parsing [sent. 11121 len. 24]: - Ilka nicht , as sure as I lay doon i ' the snaw to sleep , I dreamed I was at hame .
