Parsing [sent. 1 len. 13]: THE STOWAWAY CHAPTER I THE `` ANDROMEDA '' `` Marry Mr. Bulmer !
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 5]: That horrid old man !
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 10]: Uncle , what _ are _ you saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 26]: The girl sprang to her feet as if she were some timid creature of the wild aroused from sylvan broodings by knowledge of imminent danger .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 25]: In her terror , she upset the three wineglasses that formed part of the display beside each _ couvert _ on the luncheon table .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 30]: One , rose-tinted and ornate , crashed to the floor , and the noise seemed to irritate the owner of Linden House more than his niece 's shrill terror .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 28]: `` No need to bust up our best set of ` ock glasses just because I ` appen to mention owd Dickey Bulmer , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 15]: The color startled so suddenly out of the girl 's face began to return .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 8]: Her eyes lost their dilation of fear .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 23]: Somehow , the comment on the broken glass seemed to deprive `` owd Dickey Bulmer 's '' personality of its real menace .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 21]: `` I 'm sorry , '' she said , and stooped to pick up the fragments scattered over the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 11]: `` Leave that alone , '' came the sharp order .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 36]: `` So long as I 've the brass to pay for 'em , there 's plenty more where that kem from , an ' in any case , it 's the ` ousemaid 's job .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 8]: Leave it alone , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 5]: An ' sit down .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 42]: It 's ` igh time you an ' me ` ad a straight talk , an ' I ca n't do wi ' folk bouncin ' about like an injia-rubber ball when I 've got things to say to 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 57]: He stretched a fat hand toward a mahogany cigar-box , affected to choose a cigar with deliberative crackling , hacked at the selection with a fruit knife , and dropped the severed end into an unused finger-bowl ; then he struck a match , and puffed furiously until a rim of white ash tipped the brown .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 10]: This achieved , he helped himself to the port .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 77]: Though he carefully avoided glancing at his companion , he knew quite well that she had drawn a chair to the opposite end of the table , and was looking at him intently ; her chin was propped on her clenched hands ; the skin on her white forehead was puckered into nervous lines ; her lips , pressed close , had lost their Cupid 's bow that seemed ever ready to bend into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 68]: Meanwhile , the man who had caused these signs of distress gulped down some of the wine , held the glass up to the light as a tribute to the excellence of its contents , darted his tongue several times in and out between his teeth , smacked his lips , replaced the cigar in his mouth , and leaned back in his chair until it creaked .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 21]: Iris Yorke was accustomed to this ritual ; she gave it the unobservant tolerance good breeding extends to the commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 55]: But to-day , for the first time during the two years that had sped so happily since she came back to Linden House from a Brussels _ pension _ , she found herself , even in her present trouble , wondering how it was possible that David Verity could be her mother 's brother .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 41]: This coarse-mannered hog of a man , brother to the sweet-voiced , tender-hearted gentlewoman whose gracious wraith was left undimmed in the girl 's memory by the lapse of years -- it would be unbelievable if it were not true !
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 25]: He was so gross , so tubby , so manifestly over-fed , whereas her mother had ever been elegant and _ bien soign√©e _ .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 12]: But he had shown kindness to her in his domineering way .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 19]: He was not quite so illiterate as his accent and his general air of uncouthness seemed to imply .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 22]: In his speech , the broad vowels of the Lancashire dialect were grafted on to the clipped staccato of a Cockney .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 29]: He would scoff at anyone who told him that knives and forks had precise uses , or that table-napkins were not meant to be tucked under the chin .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 62]: In England , especially in the provinces , some men of affairs cultivate these minor defects , deeming them tokens of bluff honesty , the hall-marks of the self-made ; and David Verity thought , perhaps , that his pretty , well-spoken niece might be trusted to maintain the social level of his household without any special effort on his part .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 23]: Shocked , almost , at the disloyalty of her thoughts , Iris tried to close the rift that had opened so unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 15]: `` It was stupid of me to take you seriously , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 15]: `` You can not really mean that Mr. Bulmer wishes to marry me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 10]: Verity screwed up his features into an amiable grin .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 14]: He pressed the tips of his fingers together until the joints bent backward .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 11]: When he spoke , the cigar waggled with each syllable .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 14]: `` I meant it right enough , my lass , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 12]: `` But , uncle dear -- '' `` Stop a bit .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 15]: Listen to me first , an ' say your say when I 've finished .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 12]: Like everybody else , you think I 'm a rich man .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 39]: David Verity , Esquire , ship-owner , of Linden House an ' Exchange Buildings -- it looks all right , do n't it -- like one of them furrin apples with rosy peel an ' a maggot inside .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 11]: You 're the first I 've told about the maggot .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 7]: Fact is , I 'm broke .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 13]: Ship-ownin ' is rotten nowadays , unless you 've lots of capital .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 5]: I 've lost mine .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 24]: Unless I get help , an ' a thumpin ' big slice of it , my name figures in the _ Gazette _ .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 18]: I want fifty thousand pounds , an ' oo 's goin ' to give it to me ?
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 4]: Not the public .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 8]: They 're fed up on shippin ' .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 11]: They 're not so silly as they used to be .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 26]: I put it to owd Dickey yesterday , an ' ' e said you could n't raise money in Liverpool to-day to build a ferry-boat .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 7]: But ' e said summat else .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 23]: If you wed ` im , ' e makes you a partner in the firm of Verity , Bulmer an ' Co. .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 2]: See ?
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 6]: Wot 's wrong with that ?
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 16]: I 've done everything for you up to date ; now it 's your turn .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 6]: Simple , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 46]: P'raps I ought to have explained things differently , but it did n't occur to me you 'd hobject to bein ' the wife of a millionaire , even if ' e is a doddrin ' owd idiot to talk of marryin ' agin . ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 6]: `` Oh , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 18]: With a wail of despair , the girl sank back and covered her face with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 13]: Now that she believed the incredible , she could utter no protest .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 7]: The sacrifice demanded was too great .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 30]: In that bitter moment she would have welcomed poverty , prayed even for death , as the alternative to marriage with the man to whom she was being sold .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 13]: Verity leaned over the table again and finished the glass of port .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 14]: This time there was no lip-smacking , or other aping of the connoisseur .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 7]: He was angry , almost alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 14]: Resistance , even of this passive sort , raised the savage in him .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 12]: Hitherto , Iris had been ready to obey his slightest whim .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 25]: `` There 's no use cryin ' ` Oh , uncle , ' an ' kicking up a fuss , '' he snapped viciously .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 21]: `` Where would you ` ave bin , I 'd like to know , if it was n't for me ?
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 20]: In the gutter -- that 's where your precious fool of a father left your mother an ' you .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 26]: You 're the best dressed , an ' best lookin ' , an ' best eddicated girl i ' Bootle to-day -- thanks to me .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 44]: When your mother kem ` ere ten year ago , an ' said her lit ` rary gent of a ` usband was dead , neither of you ` ad ` ad a square meal for weeks -- remember that , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 12]: It is n't my fault you 've got to marry Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 23]: It 's just a bit of infernal bad luck -- the same for both of us , if it comes to that .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 21]: An ' why should n't you ` ave some of the sours after I 've given you all the sweets ?
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 25]: You 'll ` ave money to burn ; I 'm not axin ' you to give up some nice young feller for ` im .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 25]: If you play your cards well , you can ` ave all the fun you want -- '' The girl staggered to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 12]: She could endure the man 's coarseness but not his innuendoes .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 34]: `` I will do what you ask , '' she murmured , though there was a pitiful quivering at the corners of her mouth that bespoke an agony beyond the relief of tears .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 34]: `` But please do n't say any more , and never again allude to my dear father in that way , or I may -- I may forget what I owe you . ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 42]: She was unconscious of the contempt in her eyes , the scornful ring in her voice , and Verity had the good sense to restrain the wrath that bubbled up in him until the door closed , and he was alone .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 9]: He grabbed the decanter and refilled his glass .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 5]: `` Nice thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 3]: he growled .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 44]: `` I offer ` er a fortune an ' a bald - ` eaded owd devil for a ` usband , ` oo ought to die in a year or two an ' leave ` er everything ; yet she ai n't satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 23]: D -- n ` er eyes , if I 'd keep ` er as scullery-maid she 'd ` ave different notions . ''
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 39]: With the taste of the wine , however , came the consoling reflection that Iris as a scullery-maid might not tickle the fancy of the dotard who had undertaken to provide fifty thousand pounds for the new partnership .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 9]: And she had promised -- that was everything .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 24]: His lack of diplomacy was obvious even to himself , but he had won where a man of finer temperament might have failed .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 8]: Now , he must rush the wedding .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 19]: Dickey Bulmer 's Lancashire canniness might stipulate for cash on delivery as the essence of the marriage contract .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 17]: Not a penny would the old miser part with until he was sure of the girl .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 30]: So David Verity , having much to occupy his mind , lingered over the second glass of port , for this was a Sunday dinner , served at mid-day .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 31]: At last he closed his eyes for his customary nap ; but sleep was not to be wooed just then ; instead of dozing , he felt exceedingly wide awake .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 19]: Indeed , certain disquieting calculations were running through his brain , and he yielded forthwith to their insistence .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 16]: Taking a small notebook from his pocket , he jotted down an array of figures .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 30]: He was so absorbed in their analysis that he did not see Iris walk listlessly across the lawn that spread its summer greenery in front of the dining-room windows .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 9]: And that was an ill thing for David .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 15]: The sight of the girl at that instant meant a great deal to him .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 12]: He did happen to look out , a second too late .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 52]: Even then , he might have caught a glimpse of Iris 's pink muslin skirt disappearing behind a clump of rhododendrons , were not his shifty eyes screwed up in calculation -- or perchance , the gods blinded him in behalf of one who was named after Juno 's bright messenger .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 12]: `` Yes , that 's it , '' he was thinking .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 10]: `` I must wheedle Dickey into the bank to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 19]: A word from ` im , an ' they 'll all grovel , d -- n 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 4]: The door opened .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 14]: `` Captain Coke to see you , sir , '' said a servant .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 14]: `` Send ` im in ; bring ` im in ` ere . ''
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 23]: The memorandum book disappeared ; Verity 's hearty greeting was that of a man who had not a care in the world .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 13]: His visitor 's description was writ large on him by the sea .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 19]: No one could possibly mistake Captain Coke for any other species of captain than that of master mariner .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 16]: He was built on the lines of a capstan , short and squat and powerful .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 25]: Though the weather was hot , he wore a suit of thick navy-blue serge that would have served his needs within the Arctic Circle .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 46]: It clung tightly to his rounded contours ; there was a purple line on his red brows that marked the exceeding tightness of the bowler hat he was carrying ; and the shining protuberances on his black boots showed that they were tight , too .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 17]: It was manifestly out of the question that he should be able to walk any distance .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 42]: Though he had driven in a cab to the shipowner 's house , he was already breathless with exertion , and he rolled so heavily in his gait that his shoulders hit both sides of the doorway while entering the room .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 28]: Yet he was nimble withal , a man capable of swift and sure movement within a limited area , therein resembling a bull , or a hippopotamus .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 12]: The hospitable Verity pushed forward the mahogany box and the decanter .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 11]: `` Glad to see you , Jimmie , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 4]: Sit yourself down .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 12]: ` Ave a cigar an ' a glass o ' port .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 20]: I did n't expect you quite so soon , but you 're just as welcome now as later . ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 22]: Captain Coke placed his hat on top of a malacca cane , and balanced both against the back of a chair .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 19]: `` I 'll take a smoke but no wine , thankee , Mr. Verity , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 18]: `` I kem along now ' ` coss I want to be aboard afore it 's dark .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 9]: We 're moored in an awkward place . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 7]: `` Poor owd _ Andromeeda _ !
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 11]: Just ` er usual luck , eh , Jimmie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 42]: `` Well , she ai n't wot you might call one of fortune 's fav ` rits , but she 's afloat , an ' that 's more 'n you can say for a good many daisy-cutters I 've known . ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 3]: Verity chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 22]: `` Some ships are worth less afloat than ashore , an ' she 's one of 'em , '' he grinned .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 6]: `` You want a match .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 6]: ` Ere you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 51]: Whether Coke was wishful to deny or admit the _ Andromeda 's _ shortcomings -- even the ship herself might have protested against the horror of a long `` e '' in the penultimate syllable of her name -- the other man 's rapid proffer of a light stopped him .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 40]: He puffed away in silence ; there was an awkward pause ; for once in his career , Verity regretted his cultivated trick of covering up a significant phrase by quickly adding some comment on a totally different subject .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 25]: But the sailor smoked on , stolidly heedless of a sudden lapse in the conversation , and the shipowner was compelled to start afresh .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 18]: He was far too shrewd to go straight back to the topic burked by his own error .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 35]: His sledge-hammer methods might be crude to the verge of brutality where Iris was concerned , but they were capable of nice adjustment in the case of wary old sea-dogs of the Coke type .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 26]: `` It 's stuffy in ` ere with the two of us smokin ' -- let 's stroll into the garden , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 4]: Coke was agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 13]: He liked gardens ; they were a change from the purple sea .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 26]: `` It 's the on ' y bit of green stuff you seem to be fond of , Mr. Verity , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 10]: `` You keep us crool short of vegetables . ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 6]: David 's little eyes twinkled .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 21]: Here was another opening ; it would not be his fault if it led again up a _ cul-de-sac _ .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 12]: He threw wide the window , and they crossed the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 4]: `` Vegetables ! ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 19]: `` Wish I could stock you from my place , an ' I 'd stuff you with 'em .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 40]: I can grow 'em ` ere for next to nothing , but they cost a heap o ' money in furrin ports , an ' _ your _ crimson wave-catcher does n't earn money -- she eats it . ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 22]: `` Even that 's one better 'n her skipper , ` oo does n't do neether , '' commented Coke gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 11]: His employer seemed to find much humor in the remark .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 9]: `` Gad , we both look starved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 3]: he guffawed .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 28]: `` To ` ear us , you 'd think we was booked for the workhus or till you ran a tape round the contoor , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 8]: But Coke was not to be cheered .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 37]: `` I can see as far into a stone wall as ` ere a one an ' there a one , '' he said , `` an ' there 's no use blinkin ' the fax .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 19]: The _ Andromeda _ was a good ship in ` er day , but that day is gone .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 18]: You ought to ` ave sold ` er to the Dutchmen five years ago , Mr. Verity .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 25]: Times were better then , an ' now you 'd ` ave a fine steel ship instead of a box of scrap iron . ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 25]: They were passing the rhododendrons , and Verity 's quick eyes noted that a summer-house beneath the shade of two venerable elms was unoccupied .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 29]: The structure consisted of a rustic roof carried on half a dozen uprights ; it had a wooden floor , and held a table and some basket chairs .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 19]: The roof and supports were laden with climbing roses , a Virginian creeper , and a passion flower .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 29]: The day being Sunday , there were no gardeners in the adjoining shrubbery or rose garden , and anyone seated in the summer-house could see on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 13]: `` Drop anchor in ` ere , Coke , '' said Verity .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 22]: `` It 's cool an ' breezy , an ' we can ` ave a quiet confab without bein ' bothered .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 26]: Now , I reelly sent for you to-day to tell you I mean to better the supplies this trip -- Yes , honest Injun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 53]: -- for the _ Andromeda 's _ skipper had clutched the cigar out of his mouth with the expression of a man who vows to heaven that he can not believe his ears -- `` I 'm goin ' to bung in an extry ` undred to-morrow in the way of stores .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 7]: Funny , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 3]: `` Funny !
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 6]: It 's a meracle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 38]: Though not altogether gratified by this whole-hearted agreement with his own views , Verity was too anxious to keep his hearer on the present tack to resent any implied slur on his earlier efforts as a caterer .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 20]: `` It 's nothing to wot I 'd do if I could afford it , '' he added graciously .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 14]: `` But , as you said , let 's look at the fax .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 50]: Wot chance ` as an iron ship , built twenty years ago , at a cost of sixteen pound a ton , ag ` in a steel ship of to-day , at seven pound a ton , with twiced the cargo space , an ' three feet less draught ?
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 6]: W ' y no earthly .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 6]: We 're dished every way .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 44]: We cost more to run ; we ca n't jump ` arf the bars ; we ca n't carry ` arf the stuff ; we pay double insurance ; an ' we 're axed to find interest on more 'n double the capital .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 15]: As you say , Jimmie , wot bloomin ' chanst ` ave we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 26]: Coke smoked silently ; he had said none of these things , but when the shipowner 's glance suddenly dwelt on him , he nodded .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 14]: Silent acquiescence on his part , however , was not what Verity wanted .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 11]: He , too , knew when to hold his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 28]: After a long interval , during which a robin piped a merry roundelay from the depths of a neighboring pink hawthorn , Coke dug out a question .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 8]: `` Premium gone up , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 8]: `` She 's on a twelve-month rate .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 6]: It runs out in September .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 20]: If you 're lucky , an ' fill up with nitrate soon , you may be ` ome again .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 14]: If not , I 'll ` ave to whack up a special quotation .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 9]: After that , there 'll be no insurance .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 12]: The _ Andromeeda _ goes for wot she 'll fetch . ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 10]: Another pause ; then Coke broached a new phase .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 21]: `` Meanin ' that I lose the two thousand pounds I put in ` er to get my berth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 4]: he said huskily .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 7]: `` An ' wot about me ?
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 9]: _ I _ lose eight times as much .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 5]: Just think of it !
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 40]: Sixteen thousand pounds would give me a fair balance to go on wi ' i ' these hard times , an ' your two thou ' would make the skipper 's job in my new ship a certainty . ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 6]: Coke 's brick-red face darkened .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 4]: He breathed hard .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 6]: `` Wot new ship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 4]: Verity smiled knowingly .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 20]: `` It 's a secret , Jimmie , but I must stretch a point for a pal 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 26]: Dickey Bulmer 's goin ' to marry my niece , an ' ' e ` as pledged himself to double the capital of the firm .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 11]: Now I 've let the cat out of the bag .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 48]: I 'm sorry , ole man -- pon me soul , I am -- but w ` en Dickey 's name crops up on ` Change you know as well as me ` ow many captain 's tickets will be backed wi ' t ' brass . ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 28]: This time , if so minded , the robin might have trilled his song _ adagio con sostenuto _ without fear of interruption by those harsh voices .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 41]: Neither man spoke during so long a time that the break seemed to impose a test of endurance ; in such a crisis , he who has all at stake will yield rather than he who only stakes a part .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 11]: `` S'pose we talk plainly as man to man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 8]: said Coke thickly , at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 13]: _ I _ ca n't talk much plainer , '' said Verity .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 6]: `` Yes , you can .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 25]: Promise me the command of your next ship , an ' the Andromeda goes on the rocks this side o ' Monte Video . ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 13]: Verity jumped as though he had been stung by an infuriated wasp .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 27]: `` Coke , I 'm surprised at you , '' he grunted , not without a sharp glance around to make sure no other was near .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 27]: `` No , you ai n't , not a bit surprised , on ' y you do n't like to ` ear it in cold English .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 13]: That 's wot you 're drivin ' at -- the insurance . ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 7]: `` Shut up , you ijjit .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 15]: Never ` eard such d -- d rot in all me born days . ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 8]: `` Listen to it now , then .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 13]: It 's good to ` ave the truth tole you some times .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 6]: Wot are you afraid of ?
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 13]: I take all the risk an ' precious little of the money .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 9]: Write me a letter -- '' `` Write !
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 2]: Me !
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 7]: Coke , you 're loony . ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 4]: `` Not me .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 6]: Wait till I 'm through .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 27]: Write a letter sayin ' you 're sorry the _ Andromeda _ must be laid up this fall , but promisin ' me the next vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 11]: ` Ow does that ` urt _ you _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 7]: Verity 's cigar had gone out .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 22]: He relighted it with due deliberation ; it could not be denied that his nerve , at least , was superb .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 16]: `` I 'm willin ' to do anything in reason , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 31]: `` I do n't see where I can lay ` ands on a better man than you , Jimmie , even if you _ do _ talk nonsense at times .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 13]: You know the South American trade , an ' you know me .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 8]: By gad , I 'll do that .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 27]: Anyhow , it 's wot you deserve , but none the less , I 'm actin ' as a reel friend , now ai n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 15]: Many a man would just lay you up alongside the _ Andromeeda _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 32]: `` I 'll call at your office in the mornin ' for the letter , '' said Coke , whose red face shone like the setting sun seen through a haze .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 8]: I 'll ` ave it ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 13]: `` An ' you wo n't back out of them extry stores ?
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 10]: I must sweeten the crew on this run . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 17]: `` I 'll supply the best of stuff -- enough to last for the round trip .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 7]: But do n't make any mistake .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 8]: You must be back afore September 30th .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 8]: That 's the date of the policy .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 26]: Now let 's trot inside , an ' my gal -- Mrs. Dickey Bulmer that is to be -- will give you some tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 4]: `` Tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 3]: snorted Coke .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 16]: `` Well , there 's whisky an ' soda on tap if you prefer it .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 10]: It _ is _ rather ` ot for tea .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 2]: Whew !
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 5]: you 're boilin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 10]: W ' y do n't you wear looser clo'es ?
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 9]: Look at me -- cool as a cucumber .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 16]: By the way , ` oo 's the new man you 've shipped as second ?
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 17]: Watts is the chief , I know , but ` oo is Mr. Philip Hozier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 18]: `` Youngster fillin ' in sea-service to get a ticket an ' qualify for the Cunard . ''
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 10]: `` Thoroughly reliable sort of chap , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 5]: `` The best . ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 13]: It was odd how these men left unsaid the really vital things .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 16]: Again it was Coke who tried to fill in some part of the blank space .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 20]: `` Just the right kind of second for the _ Andromeda 's _ last cruise , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 7]: `` Smart as a new pin .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 12]: You could trust ` im on the bridge of a battleship .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 20]: Now , Watts is a good man , but a tot of rum makes ` im fair daft . ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 14]: purred Verity , `` you must keep a tight ` and on Watts .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 38]: I like an appetizer meself w ` en I 'm off dooty , so to speak , but it 's no joke to ` ave a boozer in charge of a fine ship an ' vallyble freight .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 25]: Of course , you 're responsible as master , but you ca n't be on deck mornin ' , noon , an ' night .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 15]: Choke Watts off the drink , an ' you 'll ` ave no trouble .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 5]: So that 's settled .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 20]: My , but you 're fair meltin ' -- wot is it they say -- losin ' adipose tisher .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 5]: Well , come along .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 5]: Let 's lubricate . ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 18]: * * * * * * The _ Andromeda _ sailed on the Tuesday afternoon 's tide .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 45]: She would drop the pilot off Holyhead , and , with fair weather , such as cheered her departure from the Mersey , daybreak on Thursday would find her pounding through the cross seas where St. George 's Channel merges into the wide Atlantic .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 40]: If she followed the beaten track on her long run to the River Plate -- as sailors will persist in miscalling that wondrous Rio de la Plata -- she might be signaled from Madeira or the Cape Verde Islands .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 22]: But shipmasters often prefer to set a course clear of the land till they pick up the coast of South America .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 30]: If she were not spoken by some passing steamer , there was every possibility that the sturdy old vessel would not be heard of again before reaching her destination .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 35]: * * * * * * But David Verity heard of her much sooner , and no thunderbolt that ever rent the heavens could have startled him more than the manner of that hearing .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 25]: Resolving to clinch matters with regard to Iris and her elderly suitor , he invited `` Owd Dickey '' to supper on Sunday evening .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 16]: The girl endured the man 's presence with a placid dignity that amazed her uncle .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 31]: On the plea of a headache , she retired at an early hour , leaving Bulmer to gloat over his prospective happiness , and primed to the point of dementia .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 46]: He was quite willing to accompany Verity to the bank next morning ; a pleasant-spoken manager sighed his relief when the visitors were gone , and he was free to look at the item `` bills discounted '' on Verity 's page in the ledger .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 32]: More than that , a lawyer was instructed to draw up a partnership deed , and the representatives of various ship-building firms were asked to supply estimates for two new vessels .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 14]: Altogether Dickey was complaisant , and David enjoyed a busy and successful day .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 37]: He dined in town , came home at a late hour , and merely grinned when a servant told him that Mr. Bulmer had called twice but Miss Iris happened to be out on both occasions .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 22]: Nevertheless , at breakfast on Tuesday , he warned his niece not to keep her admirer dangling at arm 's length .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 13]: `` E 's a queer owd codger , '' explained the philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 24]: `` Play up to ` im a bit , an ' you 'll be able to twist ` im round your little finger .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 35]: I b ` lieve he 's goin ' dotty , an ' you can trust me to see that the marriage settlement is O. K. '' `` Will you be home to dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 4]: was her response .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 16]: Now that the firm is in smooth water again I must show myself a bit .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 17]: It 's all thanks to you , lass , an ' I 'll not forget it .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 3]: Good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 9]: Iris smiled , and Verity was vastly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 13]: `` I am sure you will not forget , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 4]: `` Good-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 23]: `` There 's no understandin ' wimmin , '' mused David , as his victoria swept through the gates of Linden House .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 32]: `` Sunday afternoon Dickey might ha ' bin a dose of rat poison ; now she 's ready to swaller ` im as if ' e was a chocolate drop . ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 40]: Again he returned some few minutes after midnight ; again the servant announced Mr. Bulmer 's visits , three of them ; and again Miss Iris had been absent -- in fact , she had not yet come home .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 6]: `` Not ` ome ! ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 4]: cried David furiously .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 9]: `` W ' y it 's gone twelve .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 10]: W'ere the -- w ` ere is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 4]: No one knew .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 17]: She had quitted the house soon after Verity himself , and had not been seen since .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 19]: Storm and rage as he might , and did , David could not discover his niece 's whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 32]: He spent a wearying and tortured night , a harassed and miserable day , devoted to frantic inquiries in every possible direction with interludes of specious lying to the infatuated Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 7]: But enlightment came on Thursday morning .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 8]: A letter arrived by the first post .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 5]: It was from Iris .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 37]: `` MY DEAR UNCLE , '' she wrote : `` Neither you nor Mr. Bulmer should have any objection to my passing the few remaining weeks of my liberty in the manner best pleasing to myself .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 21]: On Sunday evening , in your presence , Mr. Bulmer urged me to fix an early date for our marriage .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 19]: Tell him that I shall marry him when the _ Andromeda _ returns to England from South America .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 33]: You will remember that you promised last year to take me to Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Ayres this summer ; I have been learning Spanish so as to help our sight-seeing .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 21]: Unfortunately , business prevents you from keeping that promise , but there is no reason why I should not go .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 22]: I am on board the _ Andromeda _ , and will probably be able to explain matters satisfactorily to Captain Coke .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 24]: The vessel is due back at the end of September , I believe , so Mr. Bulmer will not have long to wait .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 35]: It is more than likely that Captain Coke will not know I am aboard until Thursday , and I have arranged with a friend that this letter shall reach you about the same time .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 25]: Please convey my apologies to Mr. Bulmer , and accept my regret for any anxiety you may have felt owing to my unaccountable absence .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 10]: `` Your affectionate niece , `` IRIS YORKE . ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 7]: David narrowly escaped an apoplectic seizure .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 11]: When he recovered his senses he looked ten years older .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 21]: The instinct of self-preservation alone saved him in his frenzy from blurting forth the tidings of the girl 's flight .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 22]: Incoherent with fear and passion , he contrived to give orders for his carriage , and was driven to his office .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 30]: Thence he dispatched telegrams to every signaling station in England , Ireland , and Spain , at which by the remotest possibility the _ Andromeda _ might be intercepted .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 54]: He cabled to Madeira and Cape Verde , even to Fernando Noronha and Pernambuco ; he sent urgent instructions to the pilotage authorities of the Bristol Channel , the southwest ports , and Lisbon ; and the text of every message was : '' _ Andromeda _ must return to Liverpool instantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 10]: But the wretched man realized that he was doomed .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 7]: Fate had struck at him mercilessly .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 36]: He could only wait in dumb despair , and mutter prayers too long forgotten , and concoct bogus letters from a cousin 's address in the south of England for the benefit of Dickey Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 28]: Never was ship more eagerly sought than the _ Andromeda _ , yet never was ship more completely engulfed in the mysterious silence of the great sea .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 15]: The days passed , and the weeks , yet nothing was heard of her .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 85]: She figured in the `` overdue '' list at Lloyd 's ; sharp-eyed underwriters did `` specs '' in her ; woe-begone women began to haunt the Liverpool office for news of husbands and sons ; the love-lorn Dickey wore Verity to a shadow of his former self by alternate pleadings and threats ; but the _ Andromeda _ remained mute , and the fanciful letters from Iris became fewer and more fragmentary as David 's imagination failed , and his excuses grew thinner .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 42]: And the odd thing was that if David had only known it , he could have saved himself all this heart-burning and misery by looking through the dining-room window on that Sunday afternoon when his prospects seemed to be so rosy .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 6]: He never thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 61]: He cursed every circumstance and person impartially and fluently , but he omitted from the Satanic litany the one girlish prank of tree-climbing that led Iris to spring out of sight amid the sheltering arms of an elm when her uncle and Captain Coke deemed the summer-house a suitable place for `` a plain talk as man to man . ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 33]: So David learnt what it meant to wait , and listen , and start expectantly when postman 's knock or telegraph messenger 's imperative summons sounded on door of house or office .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 7]: But he waited long in vain .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 31]: The _ Andromeda _ , like her namesake of old , might have been chained to a rock on some mythical island guarded by the father of all sea serpents .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 13]: As for a new Perseus , well -- David knew him not .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 29]: CHAPTER II WHEREIN THE `` ANDROMEDA '' BEGINS HER VOYAGE The second officer of the _ Andromeda _ was pacing the bridge with the slow alertness of responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 35]: He would walk from port to starboard , glance forrard and aft , peer at the wide crescent of the starlit sea , stroll back to port , and again scan ship and horizon .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 35]: Sometimes he halted in front of the binnacle lamp to make certain that the man at the wheel was keeping the course , South 15 West , set by Captain Coke shortly before midnight .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 52]: His ears listened mechanically to the steady pulse-beats of the propeller ; his eyes swept the vague plain of the ocean for the sparkling white diamond that would betoken a mast-head light ; he was watchful and prepared for any unforeseen emergency that might beset the vessel intrusted to his care .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 45]: But his mind dwelt on something far removed from his duties , though , to be sure , every poet who ever scribbled four lines of verse has found rhyme and reason in comparing women with stars , and ships , and the sea .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 25]: If Philip Hozier was no poet , he was a sailor , and sailors are notoriously susceptible to the charms of the softer sex .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 46]: But the only woman he loved was his mother , the only bride he could look for during many a year was a mermaid , though these sprites of the deep waters seem to be frequenting undiscovered haunts since mariners ceased to woo the wind .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 50]: For all that , if perforce he was heart-whole , there was no just cause or impediment why he should not admire a pretty girl when he saw one , and an exceedingly pretty girl had honored him with her company during a brief minute of the previous day .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 57]: He was superintending the safe disposal of the last batch of cotton goods in the forward hold -- and had just found it necessary to explain the correct principles of stowage with sailor-like fluency -- when a young lady , accompanied by a dock laborer carrying a leather portmanteau , spoke to him from the quay .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 8]: `` Is Captain Coke on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 28]: `` No , madam , '' said he , lifting his cap with one hand , and restraining the clanking of a steam windlass with the other .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 33]: `` I am Mr. Verity 's niece , and I wish to send this parcel to Monte Video -- may I put it in some place where it will be safe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 74]: Hoping that the rattling winch had drowned his earlier remarks -- which were couched in an _ lingua franca _ of the high seas -- he began to tell her that it would give him the utmost pleasure to take charge of it on her account , but she nodded , bade the porter follow , ran along a somewhat precarious gangway , and was on deck before he could offer any assistance .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 10]: `` You are Mr. Hozier , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 14]: said Iris , gazing with frank brown eyes into his frank blue ones .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 25]: She , of course , was severely self-possessed ; he , as is the way of mere man , grew more confused each instant .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 22]: `` Well , I will just pop the bag into Captain Coke 's stateroom , and leave this note with it .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 6]: I have explained everything fully .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 12]: I wrote a line in case he might be absent . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 35]: All of which was so strictly accurate that it served its purpose admirably , though the said purpose , it is regrettable to state , was the misleading and utter bamboozling of Philip Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 39]: Miss Iris Yorke knew quite well that Captain Coke was then closeted with David Verity in Exchange Buildings ; she knew , because she had watched him pass through the big swing doors of her uncle 's office .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 37]: She also knew , having made it her business to find out , that in fifteen minutes , or less , the crew would muster in the fo ` c ` sle for their mid-day meal .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 30]: Not having heard a word of Hozier 's free speech to the gentlemen of various nationalities at the bottom of the hold , she wondered why he was blushing .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 9]: `` Shall I show you the way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 7]: asked Philip , finding his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 6]: `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 12]: I have been on board the _ Andromeda _ many times .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 8]: Ah , Peter , I see you .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 10]: What is it to-day , scouse or lobscouse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 44]: `` Scouse , miss , '' said the ship 's cook , grinning widely at her recollection of the line drawn by both his patrons and himself between ship 's biscuit stewed with fresh meat and the same article flavored with salt junk .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 10]: Peter 's recognition placed Iris 's identity beyond doubt .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 13]: She said nothing more to Hozier , but tripped up the companionway .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 13]: Soon he saw her paying the man who had carried the portmanteau .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 9]: She herself seemed to be in no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 35]: She walked to the rails beneath the bridge , and found interest in watching the loading operations , which were resumed as soon as the second officer saw that his services were not wanted .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 14]: Time was pressing , and a good deal yet remained to be done .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 38]: Mr. Watts , the chief officer , who was called ashore by urgent business five minutes after the `` old man '' left the vessel , chose this awkward moment to appear from behind a bonded warehouse .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 26]: He was walking with unnatural steadiness , so Hozier made some excuse to meet him and whisper that the owner 's niece was on board .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 11]: `` Sun 's zhot , '' remarked Mr. Watts cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 26]: `` Go and lie down for a spell , '' suggested Hozier , and Mr. Watts thought it was a `` shpiffin ' idee . ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 18]: When Hozier was free to glance a second time at the cross rail , Iris had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 4]: He was annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 17]: Evidently she did not wish to encounter any more of the ship 's officers that morning .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 18]: The hatches were on , and everything was orderly before Coke 's squat figure climbed the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 15]: Hozier reported the young lady 's visit , and the skipper was obviously surprised .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 31]: As he hoisted himself up the steep ladder to the hurricane deck , the younger man heard him condemning someone under his breath as `` a leery old beggar . ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 40]: The phrase was hardly applicable to Iris , but Coke came out of his cabin with an open letter in his hand , and bade a steward stow the portmeanteau in some other more hallowed and less inconvenient place .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 6]: And there the incident ended .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 49]: The _ Andromeda _ hauled down the Blue Peter for her long run of over 6,000 miles to Monte Video , and Hozier had routine work in plenty to occupy his mind during the first twenty-four hours at sea without perplexing it with memories of a pretty face .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 33]: Soon after Holyhead was passed , it is true , a sailor reported to the second officer that he had seen a ghost between decks , in the region of the lazarette .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 41]: It was then near midnight , a quiet hour on board ship , and Hozier told the man sharply to go to his bunk and endeavor to sleep off the effects of the bad beer imbibed earlier in the day .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 74]: Now , on this second night of the voyage , while the ship was plodding steadily southward with that fifteen point inclination to the west that would bring her far into the Atlantic soon after daybreak , Philip remembered Mr. Verity 's niece , and felt sorry that when she paid those former visits to the _ Andromeda _ , fate had decreed that he should be serving his time on another vessel .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 12]: For there was an expression in her eyes that haunted him .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 72]: Though she addressed him with that absence of restraint which is a heaven-sent attribute of every young woman when circumstances compel her to speak to a strange young man -- though her tone to the more favored cook was kindly , and even sprightly -- though Philip himself was red and inclined to stammer -- despite all these hindrances to clear judgment , he felt that she was troubled in spirit .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 47]: His acquaintance with women was of the slightest , since a youth who is taught his business on the _ Conway _ , and means to attach himself to one of the great Trans-Atlantic shipping lines , has no time to spare for dalliance in boudoirs .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 64]: But it gave him a thrill when he heard that this charming girl knew his name , and it seemed to him , for an instant , that she was looking into his very soul , analyzing him , searching for some sign that he was not as others , which meant that there were some whom she had bitter cause to distrust .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 32]: Of course , that was mere day-dreaming , a nebulous fantasy brought by her gracious presence into a medley of hurrying windlasses , strenuous orders , and sulky , panting men .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 23]: At any rate , she had left a memento of her too brief appearance on board in the shape of the bag .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 32]: He would contrive to take on his own shoulders its mission in Monte Video ; then , on returning to Liverpool , he would have an excuse for calling on her .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 8]: He did not know her name yet .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 17]: Possibly , Captain Coke would mention that interesting fact when his temper lost its raw edge .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 11]: As a last resource , the cook might enlighten him .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 37]: It was strange that he should be thinking of Iris -- far stranger than he could guess -- but his thoughts were sub-conscious , and he was in no wise neglecting the safety of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 42]: The night was clear but dark , the stars blinked with the subdued radiance that betokens fine weather , and ever and anon their reflection glimmered from the long slope of a wave like the glint of spangles on a dress .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 38]: But it was a garment of far-flung amplitude , woven on the shadowy loom of night and the sea , and from such mysterious warp and weft is often produced the sable robe of tragedy and death .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 9]: It was so now , within an ace .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 43]: At one instance , the restless plain of the ocean seemed to bear no other argosy than the _ Andromeda _ ; in the next , Hozier 's quick-moving glance had caught the pallid sheen of some small craft 's starboard light .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 9]: No need to tell him what might happen .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 16]: A sailing vessel , probably a fishing smack , was crossing the steamer 's course .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 15]: He sprang to the telegraph , and signaled `` Slow '' to the engine-room .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 23]: Simultaneously he shouted to the steersman to starboard the helm , and the siren trumpeted a single raucous blast into the silence .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 27]: With the rattle of the chains and steering-rods in the gear-boxes came a yell from the lookout forward : `` Light on the port bow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 26]: Hozier repeated the hail , but promised the blear-eyed sentinels in the bows of the ship a lively five minutes when the watch was relieved .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 10]: Slowly the _ Andromeda _ swung to the west .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 27]: Even more slowly , or so it appeared to the anxious man on the bridge , a red eye peeped into being alongside the green one .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 27]: A blacker smear showed up on the black sea , and a hoarse voice , presumably situated beneath the smear , expressed a desire for information .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 12]: `` Arr ye all aslape on board that crimson collier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 7]: it asked in a Waterford brogue .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 12]: `` Got the hooker 's wheel tied , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 20]: retorted Hozier , for the now visible schooner had not attempted to change her course by half a point .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 52]: She was now bowling along with every stitch set before a five-knot breeze from the east ; the tilt of her sails was such that she practically presented only the outline of her spars when first sighted from the steamer ; and her side lights probably had tallow candles in them .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 44]: `` Bedad , it 's aisier in moind we 'd be if you were tied to it , '' shouted the voice , and Hozier felt , like many another Saxon , that an Irishman 's last word is often the best one .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 19]: The engines resumed their cadence , and the _ Andromeda _ crept round again to South 15 West .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 21]: She was back on her proper line when a heavy step sounded on the iron rungs of the bridge ladder .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 6]: `` Wot 's up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 18]: demanded Coke , who was fully dressed , though Hozier thought he had retired two hours earlier .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 17]: `` Oh , the beer is frothin ' up to their eyes , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 14]: went on the skipper , after listening to a brief summary of events .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 11]: `` I thought , mebbe , the wheel had jammed .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 9]: But those lazy swabs want talkin ' to .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 17]: I 'll just give 'em a bit of me mind , '' and he went forward .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 20]: Hozier heard him reading the Riot Act to the shell-backs who were supposed to keep a sharp lookout ahead .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 9]: But the captain did not monopolize the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 8]: His deep notes rumbled only at intervals .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 7]: The men had something to say .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 6]: He returned to the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 37]: `` One of them scallywags sez ' e ` as seen a ghost , '' he announced , with the calm air of a man who states that the moon will rise during the next hour .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 20]: `` I wish he could see less remarkable things , such as schooners , sir , '' said Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 12]: `` But ' e swears ' e sawr it twiced . ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 18]: `` Oh , is he the man who reported a ghost outside the lazarette last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 7]: `` I s ` pose so .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 8]: Did ' e tell you about it ?
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 7]: That 's where she walks . ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 4]: `` She ! ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 19]: `` That 's his yarn -- a female ghost , a black ` un , black clo'es anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 23]: He 's a dashed fool , but he 's no boozer , though his mate 's tongue is a bit thick yet .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 19]: I 'll take the forenoon watch , an ' you might overhaul the ship for stowaways after breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 46]: Never heard of one on this journey -- I 've routed out as many as twenty at a time w ` en I was runnin ' between Wellington an ' Sydney -- but you never can tell , so ` ave a squint round . ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 46]: `` Yes , sir , '' said Hozier , and that is how it fell to his lot to discover Iris Yorke , looking very white and miserable , when the hatch of the lazarette was broken open at half-past eight o'clock on Thursday morning !
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 9]: A tramp steamer is not a complex organism .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 30]: She is made up of holds , bunkers , boilers and engines , with scanty accommodation for officers and crew grouped round the funnel or stuck in the bows .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 55]: When the boats were stripped of their tarpaulins , and a few lockers and store-rooms examined , the only available hiding-places were the shaft tunnel , the holds , and the lazarette , a small space between decks , situated directly above the propeller , where a reserve supply of provisions is generally carried .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 36]: But the door of the lazarette was locked , and the key missing , though it ought to be hanging with others , all duly labeled , on a hook in the steward 's cabin .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 15]: A duplicate set of keys in the captain 's possession was far from complete .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 27]: As the steward was certain he had fastened the lazarette himself early on Tuesday morning , there was nothing for it but to force the lock .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 18]: Even that would not have been necessary had the carpenter slackened his efforts after the first assault .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 42]: Iris cried loudly enough that she would open the door , but the noise of the shaft and the flapping of the screw drowned her voice , and she was compelled to stand clear when the stout planking began to yield .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 32]: It was dark in there , and Hozier was undeniably startled by the spectacle of a slim figure , wrapped in a long ulster , standing among the cases and packages .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 8]: `` Now , out you come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 49]: he cried , with a gruffness that was intended only to cover his own amazement ; but Iris , despite the horrors of sea-sickness and confinement in the dark , was not minded to suffer what she considered to be impertinence on the part of a second officer .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 21]: `` I am Miss Yorke , '' she said , coming forward into the half light of the lower deck .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 21]: `` Any explanation of my presence here will be given to the captain , and to no other person . ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 12]: That innocent word `` person '' is capable of many meanings .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 11]: Hozier felt that its application to himself was distinctly unfavorable .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 8]: And Iris was quite dignified and self-possessed .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 11]: She had given a few deft touches to her hair .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 9]: Her hat was set at the right angle .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 12]: Her dark gray coat and brown boots looked neat and serviceable .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 42]: `` Of course I did not know to whom I was speaking , '' he managed to say , for he now recognized the `` ghost , '' and was more surprised than he had ever been in his life before .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 10]: `` That is matterless , '' said Iris frigidly .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 7]: `` Where is Captain Coke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 9]: `` On the bridge , '' said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 7]: `` I will go to him .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 7]: Please do n't come with me .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 18]: I tried to tell you that I would unlock the door , but you refused to listen .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 7]: Will you let me pass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 5]: He obeyed in silence .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 9]: `` Well , s ` help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 9]: muttered a sailor , `` talk about suffrigettes !
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 8]: Wot price _ ` er _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 6]: Iris hurried to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 22]: The light seemed to dazzle her , and her steps were so uncertain that Hozier sprang forward and caught her arm .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 13]: `` Wo n't you sit down a moment , Miss Yorke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 24]: `` If you searched the whole ship , you could not have chosen a worse place to travel in than the lazarette . ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 28]: `` I was driven out twice at night by the rats , '' she gasped , though she strove desperately to regain control of her trembling limbs .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 5]: `` Too bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 3]: he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 8]: `` But it was your own fault .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 6]: Why did you do it ?
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 16]: At any rate , wait here a few minutes before you meet the captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 9]: `` I am not afraid of meeting him .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 5]: Why should I be ?
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 5]: He knows me . ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 23]: `` I meant only that you are hardly able to walk , but I seem to say the wrong thing every time .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 8]: There is nothing really to worry about .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 7]: We are not far from Queenstown .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 13]: We can put you ashore there by losing half a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 45]: The girl had been ill , wracked in body and distraught in mind , with the added horror of knowing that rats were scampering over the deck close to her in the noisy darkness , but she summoned a half laugh at his words .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 16]: `` You are still saying the wrong thing , Mr. Hozier , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 11]: `` The _ Andromeda _ will not put into Queenstown .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 12]: From this hour I become a passenger , not a stowaway .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 9]: My uncle knows now that I am here .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 11]: Thank you , you need not hold me any longer .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 5]: I have quite recovered .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 10]: Captain Coke is on the bridge , you said ?
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 15]: I can find my way ; this ship is no stranger to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 13]: And away she went , justifying her statements by tripping rapidly forward .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 36]: The mere sight of her created boundless excitement among such members of the crew as were on deck , but the shock administered to Mr. Watts was of that intense variety often described as electric .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 44]: In the matter of disposing of large quantities of ardent spirits he was a seasoned vessel , and , as a general rule , the first day at sea sufficed to clear his brain from the fumes of the last orgy on shore .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 14]: But , to be effective , the cure must not be too drastic .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 22]: This morning , after leaving the bridge , he had fortified his system with a liberal allowance of rum and milk .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 31]: Breakfast ended , he took another dose of the same mixture as a `` steadier , '' and he was just leaving the messroom when he set eyes on Iris .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 10]: Of course , he refused to believe his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 8]: Had they not deceived him many times ?
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 22]: said he , `` a bit liverish , '' and he pressed a rough hand firmly downward from forehead to cheek-bones .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 11]: When he looked again , the girl was much nearer .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 17]: `` Lord luv ' a duck , this time I 've got 'em for sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 3]: he groaned .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 19]: His lower jaw dropped , he stared unblinkingly , and purple veins bulged crookedly on his seamed forehead .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 9]: He was bereft of the power of movement .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 9]: He stood stock-still , blocking the narrow gangway .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 7]: `` Good morning , Mr. Watts .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 9]: You remember me , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 14]: said Iris , showing by her manner that she wished to pass him .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 13]: A slight roll of the ship assisted in the disintegration of Watts .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 17]: He collapsed sideways into the cook 's galley , the door of which was hospitably open .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 24]: Somewhat frightened by the wildness of his looks , Iris ran on , and dashed at the foot of the companion rather breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 11]: The keen air was already tingeing her cheeks with color .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 50]: When she reached the bridge , where Captain Coke was propped against the chart-house , with a thick , black cigar sticking in his mouth and apparently trying to touch his nose , she had lost a good deal of the pallor and woe-begone semblance that had demoralized Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 13]: Coke heard the rapid , light footsteps , and turned his head .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 32]: At all times slow of thought and slower of speech , he was galvanized into a sudden rigidity that differed only in degree from the symptoms displayed by his chief officer .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 16]: Certainly he could not have been more stupefied had he seen the ghost reported overnight .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 16]: `` They told me I should find you here , Captain , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 70]: `` I must apologize for thrusting my company on you for a long voyage , but -- circumstances -- were -- too much for me -- and -- '' Face to face with the commander of the ship , and startled anew by his expression of blank incredulity , the glib flow of words conned so often during the steadfast but dreadful hours spent in the lazarette failed her .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 9]: `` You know me , '' she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 7]: `` I am Iris Yorke . ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 19]: Not a syllable came from the irate and astonished man gazing at her with such a bovine stolidity .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 18]: His shoulders had not abated a fraction of their stubborn thrust against the frame of the chart-house .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 12]: His hands were immovable in the pockets of his reefer coat .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 13]: The cigar still stuck out between his lips like a miniature jib-boom .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 61]: Had he wished to terrify her by a hostile reception , he could not have succeeded more completely , though , to be just , he meant nothing of the sort ; his wits being jumbled into chaos by the apparition of the last person then alive whom he expected or desired to see on board the _ Andromeda _ .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 41]: But Iris could not interpret his mood , and she strove vainly to conquer the fear welling up in her breast because of the grim anger that seemed to blaze at her from every line of Coke 's brick-red countenance .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 47]: In the struggle to pour forth the excuses and protestations that sounded so plausible in her own ears , while secured from observation behind the locked door of her retreat , she blundered unhappily on to the very topic that she had resolved to keep secret .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 11]: `` Why are you so unwilling to acknowledge me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 15]: she cried , with a nervous indignation that lent a tremor to her voice .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 8]: `` You have met me often enough .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 12]: You saw me on Sunday at my uncle 's house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 5]: `` Did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 23]: said Coke , speaking at last , but really as much at a loss for something to say as the girl herself .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 33]: He had recognized her instantly , just as he would recognize the moon if the luminary fell from the sky , and with as little comprehension of the cause of its falling .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 14]: Of course , she took the question as a forerunner of blank denial .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 7]: This was not to be borne .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 7]: She fired into a direct attack .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 35]: `` If your memory is hazy concerning the events of Sunday afternoon , it may be helpful if I recall the conversation between my uncle and you in the summer-house , '' she snapped .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 10]: Some of the glow fled from Coke 's face .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 47]: He straightened himself and glanced at the sailor inside the wheel-house , whose attention was given instantly to the fact that the vessel 's head had fallen away a full point or more from South 15 West owing to the easterly set of a strong tide .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 16]: Vessels ' heads are apt to turn when steersmen do not attend to their business .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 10]: `` Wot 's that you 're sayin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 14]: demanded Coke , coming nearer , and looking her straight in the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 32]: `` I heard every word of that interesting talk , '' she continued valiantly , though she was sensible of a numbness that seemed to envelop her in an ice-cold mist .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 42]: `` I know what you arranged to do -- so I have promised -- to marry Mr. Bulmer -- when the _ Andromeda _ -- comes back -- '' A light broke on Coke 's intelligence that irradiated his prominent eyes .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 25]: His heavy lips relaxed into a cunning grin , and he flicked the ash off the end of the cigar with a confidential nod .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 10]: `` Oh , is _ that _ it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 7]: `` Artful old dog , Verity !
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 19]: But why in -- why did n't ' e tell me you was comin ' aboard this trip ?
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 29]: We ` ave n't the right fixin 's for a lady , so you must put up with the best we can do for you , Miss Yorke .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 45]: Nat ` rally , we 're tickled to death to ` ave your company , an ' if on ' y that blessed uncle of your 's ` ad told me wot to expect , I 'd ` ave made things ship-shape at Liverpool .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 19]: But , my god-father , wot sort of ijjit axed you to stow yourself away in the lazareet ?
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 15]: Steady now ; you ai n't a-goin ' to faint , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 7]: Coke 's amiability came too late .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 18]: His squat figure and red face suddenly loomed into a gigantic indistinctness in the girl 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 20]: She would have fallen to the deck had not the captain 's strong hands clutched her by the shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 3]: `` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 4]: Below there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 3]: he yelled .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 9]: `` Tumble up , some of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 9]: Hozier was the first to gain the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 55]: He had followed the progress of events with sufficient accuracy to realize that Miss Iris Yorke had met with a distinct rebuff by the skipper , and , judging from his own experience of her physical weakness when she emerged into daylight , he was not surprised to hear that she had fainted . ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 26]: ` Ere , take ` old , '' gurgled Coke , who had nearly swallowed the cigar in his surprise at Iris 's unforeseen collapse .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 16]: `` This kind of thing is more in your line than mine , young feller .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 17]: Just lay ` er out in the saloon , an ' ax Watts to ` elp .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 17]: His missus goes orf regular w ` en they bring ` im ` ome paralytic . ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 8]: Philip took the girl into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 31]: To carry her safely down the steep stairway he was compelled to place her head on his left shoulder and clasp her tightly round the waist with his left arm .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 69]: Some loosened strands of her hair touched his face ; he could feel the laboring of her breast , the wild beating of her heart , and he was exceeding wroth with that unknown man or woman who had driven this insensible girl to such straits that she was ready to dare the discomforts and deprivations of a voyage as a stowaway , rather than be persecuted further .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 17]: Iris was laid on a couch in the messroom , and the steward summoned Mr. Watts .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 8]: The chief officer came , looking sheepish .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 17]: It was manifestly a great relief when he found that the `` ghost '' was unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 31]: `` Oh , that 's nothing , '' he cried , in response to his junior 's eager demand for information as to the treatment best fitted for such emergencies .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 16]: `` They all drop in a heap like that w ` en they 're worried .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 25]: Fust you takes orf their gloves an ' boots , then you undoes their stays an ' rips open their dresses at the necks .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 32]: One of you rubs their ` ands an ' another their feet , an ' you dabs cold water on their foreheads , an ' burn brown paper under their noses .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 16]: In between whiles you give 'em a drink , stiff as you can make it .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 5]: It 's dead easy .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 21]: Them stays are a bit troublesome if they run to size , but she 's thin enough as it is .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 12]: Anyhow , I can show you a fine trick for that .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 16]: Just turn her over till I cast a lashin ' loose with my knife . ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 12]: Watts was elbowed aside so unceremoniously that his temper gave way .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 14]: Hozier lifted Iris 's head gently and unfastened the neck-hooks of her blouse .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 19]: He began to chafe her cold hands tenderly , and pressed back the hair from her damp forehead .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 21]: The `` chief , '' not flattered by his own reflections , thought fit to sneer at these half measures .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 39]: `` She 's on ' y a woman like the rest of 'em , '' he growled , `` even if she _ is _ the owner 's niece , an ' a good-lookin ' gal at that .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 31]: I s ` pose now you think -- '' `` I think she will want some fresh air soon , so you had better clear out , '' said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 18]: His words were quiet , but he flashed a warning glance at the other man that sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 9]: Watts retired , muttering sarcasms under his breath .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 28]: Iris revived , to find Philip supporting her with a degree of skill that was remarkable in one who had enjoyed so little experience in those matters .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 24]: She heard his voice , coming , as it seemed , rapidly nearer , urging her to sip something very fiery and spirituous .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 4]: Instantly she protested .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 8]: `` What are you giving me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 6]: `` What has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 11]: Then the whole of her world opened up before her .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 10]: Her hands flew to her throat , her hair .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 15]: She flushed into vivid life as the marble Galatea incardinated under Pygmalion 's kiss .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 6]: `` Did I faint ? ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 4]: she asked confusedly .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 10]: `` Yes , but you are all right now .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 5]: You did not fall .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 11]: Captain Coke caught you and handed you over to me .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 19]: I wish you would drink the remainder of this brandy , and rest for a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 9]: Iris pushed away the glass and sat up .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 6]: `` You carried me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 11]: `` Well , I could n't do anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 28]: `` I suppose you do n't realize what it means to a woman to feel that she has been out of her senses under such conditions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 32]: `` No , but in your case it only meant that you sighed deeply a few times and tried to bite my fingers when I wished to open your mouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 4]: `` What for ?
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 10]: Why did you want to open my mouth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 13]: `` To give you a drink -- you needed a stimulant . ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 17]: By this time a few dexterous twists and turns had restrained those wandering tresses within bounds .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 24]: She held a hair-pin between her lips , and a woman can always say exactly what she means when a hairpin prevents discursiveness .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 11]: `` I am all right now , '' she announced .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 19]: `` Will you please leave me , and tell the steward to bring me a cup of tea ?
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 24]: If there is a cabin at liberty , he might put that portmanteau in it which I brought on board at Liverpool . ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 12]: Hozier fulfilled her requests , and rejoined Coke on the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 14]: `` Miss Yorke is quite well again , sir , '' he reported .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 14]: `` She wants a cabin -- to change her clothes , I imagine .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 15]: That bag you saw -- '' `` Pretty foxy , was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 14]: broke in Coke , with a glee that was puzzling to his hearer .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 15]: `` The whole affair seems to have been carefully planned , '' agreed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 33]: `` But , as I was saying , she asked for the use of a cabin , so I told the steward to give her mine until we put into Queenstown . ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 21]: Coke , who had lighted another black and stumpy cigar , removed it in order to speak with due emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 8]: `` Put into h -- l ! ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 16]: `` But surely you will not take this young lady to the River Plate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 6]: cried the astounded second officer .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 33]: `` She knew where she was bound w ` en she kem aboard the _ Andromeda _ , '' said the skipper , frowning now like a man who argues with himself .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 24]: `` There 's her portmanter to prove it , with a label , an ' all , in her own ` and-writin ' .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 16]: It 's some game played on me by ` er an ' ` er uncle .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 25]: Any'ow , the fust time she sees land again it 'll be the lovely ` arbor of Pernambuco -- an ' that 's straight .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 45]: ` Ere she is , an ' ` ere she 'll stop , an ' the best thing you can do is spread the notion among the crew that she 's runnin ' away to avoid marryin ' a man she does n't like .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 13]: That sounds reasonable , an ' it ` appens to be true .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 19]: Verity an ' me talked it over last Sunday , p.m. '' `` To avoid a marriage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 27]: repeated Hozier , who discovered a bluff honesty , not to say candor , in the statement , not perceptible hitherto in his commander 's utterances .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 27]: `` Yes , that 's it , '' said Coke , waving the cigar across an arc of the horizon as he warmed to the subject .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 16]: `` But look ` ere , me boy , this gal sails under my flag .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 27]: I 'm , wot d'ye call it , in locomotive parentibus , or something of the sort , while she 's on the ship 's books .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 33]: You keep your mouth shut , an ' wink the other eye , an ' leave it to me to give you the chanst of your life -- eh , wot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 16]: Philip Hozier did not strive to extract the precise meaning of the skipper 's words .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 18]: The process would have been difficult , since Coke himself could not have supplied any reasonable analysis .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 49]: Somehow , to the commander 's thinking , the presence of the girl seemed to make easier the casting away of the ship -- exactly how , or what bearing her strangely-begun voyage might have on subsequent events , he was not yet in a position to say .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 45]: But when the second officer left him , and he was steeped once more in the fresh breeze and the sunshine , with his shoulders braced against the chart-house , he looked at a smoke trail on the horizon far away to the west .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 4]: `` Queenstown ! ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 3]: he chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 33]: `` Not this journey -- not if my name 's Jimmie Coke , the man ` oo is stannin ' on all that is left of ` is ` ard-earned savin 's .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 41]: No , sir , I 've got me orders an ' I 've got me letter , an ' the pore old _ Andromeda _ gets ripped to pieces in the Recife , or I 'll know the reason why .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 9]: Wot a card to play at the inquiry !
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 18]: Owner 's niece on board -- bound to South America for the good of ` er health .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 24]: ` Oo even ` eard of a man sendin ' ` is pretty niece on a ship ' e meant to throw away ?
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 13]: It 's Providential , that 's wot it is , reel Providential !
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 14]: I do believe ole Verity ` ad a ` and in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 28]: Which shows that Captain Coke confused Providence with David Verity , and goes far to prove how ill-fitted he was to theorize on the ways of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 19]: CHAPTER III WHEREIN THE `` ANDROMEDA '' NEARS THE END OF HER VOYAGE `` Five bells , miss !
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 6]: It 'll soon be daylight .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 14]: If you wants to see the Cross , now 's your time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 16]: Iris had been called from dreamless sleep by a thundering rat-tat on her cabin door .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 31]: In reply to her half-awaked cry of `` All right , '' the hoarse voice of a sailor told her that the Southern Cross had just risen above the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 49]: She had a drowsy recollection of someone saying that the famous constellation would make its appearance at seven bells , not at five , and the difference of an hour , when the time happens to be 2:30 instead of 8:30 a.m. is a matter of some importance .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 31]: But , perhaps that was a mistake ; at any rate , here was the messenger , and she resolutely screwed her knuckles into her eyes and began to dress .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 9]: In a few minutes she was on deck .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 47]: A long coat , a Tam o ' Shanter , and a pair of list slippers will go far in the way of costume at night in the tropics , and the _ Andromeda 's _ seventeenth day at sea had brought the equator very near .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 68]: At dinner on the previous evening -- in honor of the owner 's niece fashionable hours were observed for meals -- Mr. Watts mentioned , by chance , that the Cross had been very distinct during the middle watch , or , in other words , between midnight and 4 a.m. Iris at once expressed a wish to see it , and Captain Coke offered a suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 13]: `` Mr. Hozier takes the middle watch to-night , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 21]: `` We can ax ` im to send a man to pound on your door as soon as it rises .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 21]: Then you must run up to the bridge , an ' ` e 'll tell you all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 17]: If Iris was conscious of a slight feeling of surprise , she did not show it .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 61]: Hitherto , the burly skipper of the _ Andromeda _ had made it so clearly understood that none of the ship 's company save himself was to enjoy the society of Miss Iris Yorke , that she had exchanged very few words with the one man whose manners and education obviously entitled him to meet her on an equal plane .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 27]: Even at meals , he was often absent , for the captain and chief officer of a tramp steamer are not altruists where eating is concerned .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 29]: She often visited the bridge , her favorite perch being the shady side of the wheel-house , but talking to the officer of the watch was strictly forbidden .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 22]: In everything appertaining to the vessel 's navigation the discipline of a man-of-war was observed on board the _ Andromeda _ .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 18]: So Coke 's complacency came now quite unexpectedly , but Iris was learning to school her tongue .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 10]: `` Thank you very much , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 8]: `` When shall I see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 8]: `` Oh , you need n't bother .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 8]: I 'll tell ` im meself . ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 7]: She was somewhat disappointed at this .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 27]: Hozier would be free for an hour before he turned in , and they might have enjoyed a nice chat while he smoked on the poop .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 43]: In her heart of hearts , she was beginning to acknowledge that a voyage through summer seas on a cargo vessel , with no other society than that of unimaginative sailormen , savored of tedium , indeed , almost of deadly monotony .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 15]: Her rare meetings with Hozier marked bright spots in a dull round of hours .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 13]: During their small intercourse she had discovered that he was well informed .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 48]: They had hit upon a few kindred tastes in books and music ; they even differed sharply in their appreciation of favorite authors , and what could be more conducive to complete understanding than the attack and defense of the shrine of some tin god of literature ?
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 53]: While , therefore , it was strange that Captain Coke should actually propose a visit to the bridge at an unusual time -- at a time , too , when Hozier would be on duty -- it struck her as far more curious that he should endeavor to prevent an earlier meeting .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 11]: But she had never lost her intuitive fear of Coke .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 11]: His many faults certainly did not include a weak will .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 29]: He meant what he said -- also a good deal that he left unsaid -- and his word was law to everyone on board the _ Andromeda _ .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 8]: So Iris contented herself with meek agreement .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 11]: `` I shall be delighted to come at any time .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 35]: I have often read about the Southern Cross , yet three short weeks ago I little thought -- '' `` You reely did n't think about it at all , '' broke in Coke .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 23]: `` If you ` ad , you 'd ` ave known you could n't cross the line without seein ' it . ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 11]: Here was another perplexing element in the skipper 's conduct .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 8]: That Iris was a stowaway was forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 15]: She was treated with the attention and ceremony due to the owner 's niece .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 74]: Coke never lost an opportunity of dinning into the ears of Watts , or Hozier , or the steward , or any members of the crew who were listening , that Miss Yorke 's presence in their midst was a preordained circumstance , a thing fully discussed and agreed on as between her uncle and himself , but carried out in an irregular manner , owing to some girlish freak on her part .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 32]: The portmanteau , with its change of raiment , brought convincing testimony , and Iris 's own words when discovered in the lazaretto supplied further proof , if that were needed .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 23]: Her name figured in the ship 's papers , and the time of her appearance on board was recorded in the log .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 50]: Coke might be a man of one idea , but he held to it as though it were written in the Admiralty Sailing Directions ; not his would be the fault if David Verity failed to appreciate the logic of his reasoning long before an official investigation became inevitable .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 24]: A keen , invigorating breeze swept the last mirage of sleep from the girl 's brain as she flitted silently along the deck .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 10]: A wondrous galaxy of stars blazed in the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 11]: In that pellucid air the sky was a vivid ultramarine .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 13]: The ship 's track was marked by a trail of phosphorescent fire .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 24]: Each revolution of the propeller drew from the ocean treasure-house opulent globes of golden light that danced and sparkled in the tumbling waters .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 45]: It was a night that pulsated with the romance and abandon of the south , a night when the heart might throb with unutterable longings , and the blood tingle in the veins under the stress of an emotion at once passionate and mystic .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 75]: Iris , spurred on by no stronger impulse than that of the sight-seer , though not wholly unaware of an element of adventurous shyness in her expectation of a _ t√™te-√†-t√™te _ with a good-looking young man of her own status , climbed to the bridge so speedily and noiselessly that Hozier did not know of her presence until he heard her dismayed cry : `` Is _ that _ the Southern Cross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 12]: -LSB- Illustration : `` Is that the Southern Cross ? '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 4]: He turned quickly .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 7]: `` You , Miss Yorke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 34]: he exclaimed , and not even her wonder at the insignificance of the stellar display of which she had heard so much could cloak the fact that Hozier was unprepared for her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 12]: `` Of course , it is I -- who else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 12]: `` Did not Captain Coke tell you to expect me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 4]: `` How odd !
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 6]: That is what he arranged .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 10]: A man came and rapped at my door . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 7]: `` Pardon me one moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 10]: He leaned over the bridge and hailed the watch .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 34]: The same hoarse voice that had roused Iris answered his questions , and , in the faint light that came from the binnacle , she caught a flicker of amusement on his face .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 14]: `` Our excellent skipper 's intentions have been defeated , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 25]: `` He told one of the men to call him at seven bells , but not to wake you until the Cross was visible .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 8]: His orders have been obeyed quite literally .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 34]: He will be summoned in another hour , and you have been dragged from bed to gaze at the False Cross , which every foremast hand persists in regarding as the real article .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 27]: The true Cross , of which Alpha Crucis is the Southern Pole star , comes up over the horizon an hour after the false one . ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 17]: `` But Captain Coke said he would see you and warn you of my visit . ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 11]: `` I can only assure you that he did not .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 14]: Perhaps he thought it unnecessary -- meaning to be on deck himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 12]: `` Must I wait here a whole hour , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 3]: Hozier laughed .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 26]: It was amusing to find how Coke 's marked effort to keep the girl and him apart had been defeated by a sailor 's blunder .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 14]: `` I hope the waiting will not weary you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 7]: `` It is a beautiful night .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 39]: You will not catch cold if you are well wrapped up , and , no matter what you may think of the real Cross when you see it , you will never have a better chance of star-gazing .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 25]: Look at Sirius up there , brighter than the moon ; and Orion , too , incomparably grander than any star in southern latitudes .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 43]: Our dear old Bear of the north ranks far beyond the Southern Cross in magnificence ; but mist and smoke and dust contrive to rob our home atmosphere of the clearness which adds such luster to the firmament nearer the equator . ''
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 18]: Under other circumstances , Iris would have reveled in just such an opportunity of acquiring knowledge easily .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 64]: Astronomy , despite its limitations , is one of the exact sciences ; it has the charm of wonderland ; it makes to awe-stricken humanity the mysterious appeal of the infinite ; but to-night , when the heart fluttered , and the soul pined for sympathy , she was in a mood to regard with indifference the instant extinction of the Milky Way .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 22]: `` I am glad of the accident that brought me on deck somewhat earlier than was necessary , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 24]: `` You and I have not said much to each other since you routed me out of the lazaretto , Mr. Hozier . ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 10]: `` Our friends at table are somewhat -- difficult .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 16]: If only you knew how I regretted -- '' `` Oh , what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 14]: When I became a stowaway I fully expected to be treated as one .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 22]: I suppose , though , that you have often asked yourself why I was guilty of such a mad trick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 22]: `` Not exactly mad , Miss Yorke , but needless , since Captain Coke partly expected to have your company . ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 5]: `` That is absurd .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 18]: He had not the remotest notion -- '' `` Forgive me , but there you are wrong .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 18]: He says that your uncle and he discussed the matter on the Sunday before we left Liverpool .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 16]: His theory is rather borne out by the present state of the ship 's larder .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 22]: I assure you that few tramp steamers spread a table like the _ Andromeda 's _ mess during this voyage . ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 16]: Iris laughed , with a spontaneous merriment that was rather astonishing in her own ears .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 14]: `` Being the owner 's niece , I am well catered for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 6]: `` Something of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 6]: It is only natural . ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 39]: `` But I think I have read in the newspapers that when some unhappy creature is condemned to death by the law , he is supplied with luxuries that would certainly be denied to any ordinary criminal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 14]: `` Such doubtful clemency can hardly apply to you , Miss Yorke . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 31]: `` It might apply to the ship , or to that human part of her that thinks , and remembers , and is capable of -- of giving evidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 15]: She paused , fearing lest , perhaps , she might have spoken too plainly .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 29]: Coke 's counter-stroke in alluding to her dread of the proposed marriage was hidden from her ken ; Hozier , of course , was thinking of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 12]: For the moment , then , they were at cross purposes .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 14]: `` Things are not so bad as that , '' he said gently .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 31]: `` I hope I am not trespassing on forbidden ground , but it is only fair to tell you that the skipper was quite explicit , up to a point .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 28]: He said you were being forced into some matrimonial arrangement that was distasteful -- '' `` And to escape from an undesirable suitor I ran away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 10]: `` Well , the story sounded all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 21]: `` Hid myself on my uncle 's ship when I wished to avoid marrying the man of his choice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 24]: Hozier was not neglecting his work , but he did then take his eyes off the starlit sea for a few amazed seconds .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 13]: There was no mistaking the scornful ring in the girl 's words .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 28]: He could see the deep color that flooded her cheeks ; the glance that met his sparkled with an intensity of feeling that thrilled while it perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 40]: `` Please pardon me if the question hurts , but if that is not your motive , and there never was any real notion of your coming with us on the this trip , why are you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 34]: `` Because I am a foolish girl , I suppose ; because I thought that my presence might interpose a serious obstacle between a criminal and the crime he had planned to commit .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 27]: If one wants to avoid hateful people a change of climate is a most effectual means , and I had not the money for ordinary travel .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 17]: Believe me , Mr. Hozier , I am not on board the Andromeda without good reason .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 11]: I have often wished to have a talk with you .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 13]: I think you are a man who would not betray a confidence .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 13]: If you agree to help me , something may yet be done .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 28]: At first , I was sure that Captain Coke would abandon his wicked project as soon as he discovered that I knew what was in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 9]: But now , I am beginning to doubt .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 19]: Each day brings us nearer South America , and -- and -- '' She was breathless with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 31]: She drew nearer to the silent , and impassive man at her side ; dropping her voice almost to a whisper , she caught his arm with an appealing hand .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 19]: `` I am afraid that my presence will offer no hindrance to his scheme , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 33]: `` I am terrified to say such a thing , but I am certain , quite _ certain _ , that the ship will be lost within the next few days . ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 23]: Hozier , though incredulous , could not but realize that the girl was saying that which she honestly thought to be true .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 3]: `` Lost !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 13]: Do you mean that , she will be purposely thrown away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 35]: he asked , and his own voice was not wholly under control , for he was called on to repress a sudden temptation to kiss away the tears that glistened in her brown eyes .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 20]: `` Yes , that is what he said -- on the rocks , this side of Monte Video . ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 7]: `` He said -- who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 7]: `` The -- the captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 9]: `` To whom did he say it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 19]: `` Oh , Mr. Hozier , do not ask that , but believe me and help me . ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 6]: `` I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 7]: I am half distracted with thinking .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 5]: What can we do ?
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 14]: Captain Coke simply swept aside my first attempt to speak plainly to him .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 35]: But , make no mistake -- he knows that I heard his very words , and there is something in his manner , a curious sort of quiet confidence , that frightens me . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 9]: After that , neither spoke during many minutes .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 27]: The _ Andromeda _ jogged along steadily south by west , and the threshing of the propeller beat time to the placid hum of her engines .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 29]: The sturdy old ship could seemingly go on in that humdrum way forever , forging ahead through the living waters , marking her track with a golden furrow .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 49]: `` That is a very serious thing you have told me , Miss Yorke , '' muttered Hozier at last , not without a backward glance at the sailor in the wheel-house to assure himself that the man could not , by any chance , overhear their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 28]: `` But it is true -- dreadfully true , '' said Iris , clasping her hands together and resting them on the high railing of the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 18]: `` It is all the more serious inasmuch as we are helpless , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 23]: `` Do n't you see how impossible it is even to hint at it in any discussion with the man principally concerned ?
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 14]: I want to say this , though -- you are in no danger .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 16]: There is no ship so safe as one that is picked out for wilful destruction .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 24]: Men will not sacrifice their own lives even to make good an insurance policy , and I suppose that is what is intended .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 20]: So you can sleep sound o ' nights -- at any rate until we near the coast of Brazil .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 22]: I can only promise you if any watchfulness on my part can stop this piece of villainy -- Hello , there !
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 4]: What 's up ?
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 11]: Why is the ship falling away from her course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 18]: The sudden change in his voice startled the girl so greatly that she uttered a slight shriek .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 19]: It took her an appreciable time to understand that he was speaking to the man at the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 8]: But the sailor knew what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 15]: `` Something 's gone wrong with the wheel , sir , '' he bawled .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 24]: `` I was n't certain at first , so I tried to put her over a bit to s ` uth ` ard .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 7]: Then she jammed for sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 14]: Hozier leaped to the telegraph and signaled `` slow '' to the engine-room .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 23]: Already the golden pathway behind the _ Andromeda _ had changed from a wavering yet generally straight line to a well-defined curve .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 23]: There was a hiss and snort of escaping steam as the sailor inside the chart-house endeavored to force the machinery into action .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 5]: `` Steady there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 3]: bellowed Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 9]: `` Wait until we have examined the gear-boxes .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 10]: There may be a kink in a chain . ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 11]: A loud order brought the watch scurrying along the deck .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 38]: Some of the men ran to examine the bearings of the huge fan-shaped casting that governed the movements of the rudder , while others began to tap the wooden shields which protected the steering rods and chains .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 18]: In the midst of the hammering and excitement , Captain Coke swung himself up to the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 7]: `` Well , I 'm blowed !
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 6]: _ You _ here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 7]: he said , looking at Iris .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 7]: `` Wot is it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 8]: he asked , turning sharply to Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 6]: `` Wheel stuck again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 6]: Has it happened before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 9]: `` Well -- er -- not this trip .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 7]: But it ` as ` appened .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 26]: Just for a minnit I was mixin ' it up with the night you nearly ran down that bloomin ' hooker off the Irish coast .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 6]: Ah , there she goes !
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 4]: Everything O.K. now .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 10]: W'en daylight comes we 'll overhaul the fixin 's .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 16]: Nice thing if the wheel jammed just as we was crossin ' the Recife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 40]: Hozier tried to ascertain from the watch if they had found the cause of the disturbance , but the men could only guess that a chance blow with an adze had straightened a kink in one of the casings .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 7]: Coke treated the incident with nonchalance .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 20]: `` Thought you was to be called w ` en the Cross hove in sight , Miss Yorke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 4]: he said abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 26]: `` I am sorry to have to inform you that some people on board can not distinguish between falsity and truth , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 16]: `` But please do n't be angry with any of the men on my account .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 22]: Mr. Hozier tells me they often confuse the False Cross with the real one , and the mistake has been enjoyable .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 23]: Now I know all about it -- what were those stars you were telling me the names of , Mr. Hozier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 7]: Philip took the cue she offered .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 10]: `` Sirius , and Orion , and Ursa Major .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 19]: I shall write the names and particulars for you after breakfast , '' he said with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 25]: `` Reg ` lar ` umbug the Southern Cross , '' grunted Coke ; `` it ai n't a patch on the Bear . ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 14]: `` Mr. Hozier said something like that , '' put in Iris mischievously .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 5]: `` Did ` e ?
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 8]: Well ` e 's right for once .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 16]: But do n't you go an ' take as Gospel most things ' e says .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 14]: Every shipmaster knows that the second officer simply ca n't speak the truth .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 5]: It ai n't natural .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 27]: W ` y , it ` ud bust a steam pipe if ' e tole you wot ' e really thought of the ole man . ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 7]: Coke grinned at his own pleasantry .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 40]: To one of his hearers , at least , it seemed to be passing strange that he was so ready to forget such a vital defect in the steering gear as had manifested its existence a few minutes earlier .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 30]: At any rate , he remained on the bridge until long after Iris had seen and admired the cluster of stars which oldtime navigators used to regard with awe .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 24]: When shafts of white light began to taper , pennon-like , in the eastern sky , the girl went back to her cabin .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 28]: Contrary to Hozier 's expectation , Coke did not attempt to draw from him any account of their conversation prior to the inexplicable mishap to the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 25]: He examined a couple of charts , made a slight alteration in the course , and at four o'clock took charge of the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 22]: `` Just ` ave a look round now while things is quiet , '' he said , nodding to Hozier confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 20]: `` I 'll tell you wot I fancy : a rat dragged a bit of bone into a gear-box .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 17]: If the plankin ' is badly worn anywhere , get the carpenter to see to it .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 18]: I do ` ate to ` ave a feelin ' that the wheel can let you down .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 17]: S'pose we was makin ' Bahia on the homeward run , an ' that ` appened !
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 19]: It ` ud be the end of the pore ole ship ; an ' oo 'd credit it ?
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 4]: Not a soul .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 12]: They 'd all say ` Jimmie threw ` er away ! '
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 37]: Oh , I know 'em , the swine -- never a good word for a man while ' e keeps straight , but tar an ' feathers the minnit ' e ` as a misforchun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 16]: Hozier found a gnawed piece of ham-bone lying in the exact position anticipated by Coke .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 32]: An elderly salt who had served with the P. & O. recalled a similar incident as having occurred on board an Indian mail steamer while passing through the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 43]: He drew a lurid picture of the captain 's dash across the forms of lady passengers sleeping inside a curtained space on deck , and his location of the area of disturbance with an ax just in time to prevent a disaster .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 44]: The carpenter busied himself with sawing and hammering during the whole of the next two days , for the _ Andromeda _ revealed many gaps in her woodwork , but the escapade of an errant ham-bone was utterly eclipsed by a new sensation .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 21]: At daybreak one morning every drop of water in the vessel 's tanks suddenly assumed a rich , blood-red tint .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 23]: This unnerving discovery was made by the cook , who was horrified to see a ruby stream pouring into the earliest kettle .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 17]: Thinking that an iron pipe had become oxidized with startling rapidity , he tried another tap .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 37]: Finally , there could be no blinking the fact that , by some uncanny means , the whole of the fresh water on board had acquired the color if not the taste of a thin Burgundy .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 5]: Coke was summoned hastily .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 19]: _ Noblesse oblige _ ; being captain , he valiantly essayed the task of sampling this strange beverage .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 26]: `` It ai n't p ` ison , '' he announced , gazing suspiciously at the little group of anxious-faced men who awaited his verdict .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 26]: `` It sartinly ai n't p ` ison , but it 's wuss nor any teetotal brew I 've tackled in all me born days .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 22]: ` Ere , Watts , you know the tang of every kind o ' likker -- ` ave a sup ? ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 5]: `` Not me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 3]: said Watts .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 10]: `` I do n't like the look of it .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 11]: First time I 've ever seen red ink on tap .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 19]: For the rest of this trip I stick to bottled beer , or somethink with a label . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 15]: `` It smells like an infusion of permanganate of potash , '' volunteered Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 5]: `` Does it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 10]: growled Coke , who seemed to be greatly annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 16]: `` Wot a pity it ai n't an infusion of whisky an ' potash ! ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 7]: and he glared vindictively at Watts .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 45]: `` Some ijjit ` as bin playin ' a trick on us , that 's wot it is -- some blank soaker ` oo do n't give a hooraw in Hades for tea an ' corfee an ' cocoa , but wants a tonic .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 3]: Stooard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 11]: `` Yes , sir , '' said the messroom attendant .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 25]: `` Portion out all the soda water in the lockers , an ' whack it on the table every meal till it gives out .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 14]: See that nobody puts away more 'n ` is proper allowance , too .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 29]: I 'm not goin ' to cry hush-baby w ` en the _ Andromeda _ gets this sort of kid 's dodge worked off on ` er . ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 42]: `` If you 're alloodin ' to me , '' put in the incensed `` chief , '' whose temper rose on this direct provocation , `` I want to tell you now -- '' `` Does the cap fit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 3]: sneered Coke .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 7]: `` No , it does n't .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 13]: I never ` eard of that kind of potash in me life .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 11]: D'ye take me for a -- chemist 's shop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 8]: `` Never ` eard of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 21]: cried the incensed skipper , who had obviously made up his mind as to the person responsible for the outrage .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 29]: `` There 's ` arf a dozen cases of it in the after hold -- or there was , w ` en we put the hatches on . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 38]: `` Even if some of the cases were broken , sir , the contents could not reach the tanks , '' said Hozier , who fancied that Coke 's attack on the bibulous Watts was wholly unwarranted .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 10]: But the commander 's wrath could not be appeased .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 15]: `` Get this stuff pumped out , an ' ` ave the tanks scoured .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 12]: We 'll put into Fernando Noronha , an ' refill there .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 26]: It 's on ' y a day lost , an ' I guess the other liquor on board 'll last till we make the island .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 19]: Sink me , if this ai n't the queerest run this crimson ship ` as ever ` ad .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 12]: I 'll be glad w ` en it 's ended . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 10]: Coke lurched away in the direction of the chart-room .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 14]: Hozier found him there later , poring over a chart of Fernando Noronha .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 43]: Iris , on hearing the steward 's version of the affair , came to the bridge for further enlightenment , but Coke merely told her that the island was a Lloyd 's signal station , so she could cable to her uncle .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 7]: `` Can I go ashore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 4]: `` I dunno .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 4]: We 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 45]: It 's a convict settlement for the Brazils , an ' they 're mighty partic ` lar about lettin ' people land , but they 'll ` ardly object to a nice young lady like you ` avin ' a peep at 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 28]: As his tone was unusually gruff , not to say jeering , she resolved to find an opportunity of seeking Hozier 's advice on the cablegram problem .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 13]: But the portent of the blood-red water was not to be disregarded .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 9]: Never was Delphic oracle better served by nature .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 30]: The _ Andromeda _ began to roll ominously ; masses of black cloud climbed over the southwest horizon ; at midday the ship was driving through a heavy sea .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 12]: As the day wore , the weather became even more threatening .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 36]: A sky and ocean that had striven during three weeks to produce in splendid rivalry blends of sapphire blue and emerald green and tenderest pink , were now draped in a shroud of gray mist .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 27]: With increasing frequency and venom , vaulting seas curled over the bows , and sent stinging showers of spray against the canvas shield of the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 28]: Instead of the natty white drill uniform and canvas shoes of the tropics , the ship 's officers donned oilskins , sou ` westers , and sea-boots .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 28]: Torrents swept the decks , and an occasional giant among waves smote the hull with a thunderous blow under which every rivet rattled and every plank creaked .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 13]: Despite these drawbacks , the _ Andromeda _ wormed her way south .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 26]: She behaved like the stanch old sea-prowler that she was , and labored complainingly but with stubborn zeal in the teeth of a stiff gale .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 16]: Iris , of course , thought that she was experiencing the storm of a century .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 42]: Badly scared at first , she regained some stock of courage when Hozier came twice to her cabin , pounded on the door , and shouted to her such news as he thought would take her mind off the outer furies !
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 37]: The first time he announced that they were just `` crossing the line , '' and the girl smiled at the thought that Neptune 's chosen lair was uncommonly like the English Channel at its worst .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 24]: On the second occasion her visitor brought the cheering news that they would be under the lee of Fernando Noronha early next morning .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 50]: She had sufficient sea lore to understand that this implied shelter from wind and wave , but Hozier omitted to tell her that the only practicable roadstead in the island , being on the weather side , would be rendered unsafe by the present adverse combination of the elements .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 52]: In fact , Coke had already called both Watts and Hozier into council , and they had agreed with him that the wiser plan would be to bear in towards the island from the east , and anchor in smooth water as close to South Point as the lead would permit .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 26]: As for Iris 's wild foreboding that the ship was intended to be lost , Philip did not give it other than a passing thought .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 15]: Coke was navigating the _ Andromeda _ with exceeding care and no little skill .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 31]: He was a first-rate practical sailor , and it was an education to the younger man to watch his handling of the vessel throughout the worst part of the blow .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 6]: About midnight the weather moderated .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 15]: It improved steadily until a troubled dawn heralded some fitful gleams of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 13]: By that time the magnificent Peak of Fernando Noronha was plainly visible .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 15]: Coke came to the bridge and set a new course , almost due west .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 21]: The sun struggled with increasing success against the cloud battalions , and patches of blue appeared in sky and sea .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 14]: Soon it was possible to distinguish the full extent of the coast line .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 33]: Houses appeared , and trees , and green oases of cultivation , but these were mere spots of color amid the arid blackness of a land of bleak rock and stone-strewed hills .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 33]: There was a strong current setting from the southeast , and the dying gale left its aftermath in a long swell , but the _ Andromeda _ rolled on with ever-increasing comfort .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 10]: Even Iris was tempted forth by the continued sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 10]: Coke was not on the bridge at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 34]: Mr. Watts was taking the watch ; Hozier was on deck forrard , looking for gravel and shells on the instrument that picks up these valuable indications from the floor of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 5]: Suddenly the captain appeared .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 8]: He greeted Iris with a genial nod .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 11]: `` Ah , there you are , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 9]: `` Not seen you since this time yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 12]: Sorry , but there 'll be no goin ' ashore to-day .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 33]: We 're on the wrong side of the island , an ' it ` ud toss you a bit if you was to try an ' land in eether of the boats .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 10]: Take ` er in easy now , Mr. Watts .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 54]: That 's our anchorage -- over there , '' and he pointed to the mouth of a narrow channel between South Point and the Ile des Fr√©gates , the latter a tiny islet that almost blocks the entrance to a shallow bay into which runs a rivulet of good but slightly brackish water .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 31]: The ship slowed perceptibly , and Hozier busied himself with the lead , which a sailor was swinging on the starboard side from the small platform of the accommodation ladder .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 20]: Iris did not know what was said , but the queer figures repeated to Coke seemed to be satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 6]: Headlands and hills crept nearer .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 11]: The rocky arms of the island closed in on them .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 13]: A faint scent as of sweet grasses reached them from the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 26]: Iris could see several people , nearly all of them men in uniform , hurrying about with an air of excitement that betokened the unusual .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 16]: Perhaps a steamer 's advent on the south side of the island was a novelty .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 34]: Now they were in a fairly smooth roadstead ; the remnants of the gale were shouldered away from the ship by the towering cliff that jutted out on the left of the bay .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 19]: The crew were mostly occupied in clearing blocks and tackle and swinging two life-boats outward on their davits .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 6]: `` All ready forrard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 3]: roared Coke .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 6]: Hozier ran to the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 12]: He found the carpenter there , standing by the windlass brake .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 7]: `` All ready , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 5]: Coke nodded to him .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 22]: `` Give her thirty-five , '' he said , meaning thereby that the anchor should be allowed thirty-five fathoms of chain .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 34]: From the bridge , where Iris was standing , she could follow each movement of the commander 's hands as he signaled in dumbshow to the steersman or telegraphed instructions to the engine-room .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 13]: It was interesting to watch the alertness of the men on duty .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 43]: They were a scratch crew , garnered from the four quarters of the globe at the Liverpool shipping office , but they moved smartly under officers who knew their work , and the _ Andromeda _ was well equipped in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 38]: The turbulent current was surging across the bows with the speed of a mill-race , so Coke brought the vessel round until she lay broadside with the land and headed straight against the set of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 28]: It was his intent to drop anchor while in that position , and help any undue strain on the cable by an occasional turn of the propeller .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 6]: `` Keep her there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 62]: he said , half turning to the man at the wheel ; he changed the indicator from `` Full speed '' to `` Slow ahead '' ; in a few seconds the anchor chain would have rattled through the hawse-hole -- when something happened that was incomprehensible , stupefying -- something utterly remote and strange from the ways of civilized men .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 10]: The _ Andromeda _ quivered under a tremendous buffet .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 15]: There was a crash of rending iron and an instant stoppage of the engines .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 34]: Almost merging into the noise of the blow came a loud report from the land , but that , in its turn , was drowned by the hiss of steam from the exhaust .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 9]: Coke appeared to be dumfounded for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 58]: Recovering himself , he ran to the starboard side , leaned over , looked down at a torn plate that showed its jagged edges just above the water-line , and then lifted a blazing face toward a point half-way up the neighboring cliff , where a haze lay like a veil of gauze on the weather-scarred rocks .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 8]: `` You d -- d pirates ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 22]: he yelled , raising both clenched fists at the hidden battery which had fired a twelve-pound shell into the doomed ship .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 15]: The _ Andromeda _ herself seemed to recognize that she was stricken unto death .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 14]: She fell away before the current with the aimless drift of a log .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 5]: `` Let go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 10]: bellowed Coke with frenzied pantomime of action to Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 5]: It was too late .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 42]: Before the lever controlling the steam windlass that released the anchor could be shoved over , another shell plunged through the thin iron plates in the bows , smashing a steam pipe , and jamming the hawser gear by its impact .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 8]: The missile burst with a terrific report .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 40]: A sailor was knocked overboard , the carpenter was killed outright , two other men were seriously wounded , and Hozier received a blow on the forehead from a flying scrap of metal that stretched him on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 14]: The gunners on shore had not allowed for the drifting of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 17]: That second shell was meant to demolish the chart-house and clear the bridge of its occupants .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 17]: Striking high and forward , it had robbed the _ Andromeda _ of her last chance .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 13]: Now she was rolling in the full grip of the tidal stream .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 15]: It could only be a matter of a minute or less before she struck .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 23]: CHAPTER IV SHOWING WHAT BECAME OF THE `` ANDROMEDA '' The island artillery did not succeed in hitting the crippled ship again .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 16]: Three more shells were fired , but each projectile screamed harmlessly far out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 32]: A trained gunner , noting these facts , would reason that the shore battery made good practice in the first instance solely because its ordnance was trained at a known range .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 29]: Indeed , he might even hazard a guess that the _ Andromeda 's _ warm reception was arranged long before her masts and funnel rose over the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 13]: That the islanders intended nothing less than her complete destruction was self-evident .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 45]: Without the slightest warning they had tried to sink her ; and now that she was escaping the further attentions of the field pieces , a number of troops stationed on South Point and the Isle des Fr√©gates began to pelt her with bullets .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 45]: Iris , when the first paralysis of fear had passed , when her stricken senses resumed their sway and her limbs lost their palsy , flinched from this new danger , and sank sobbing to her knees behind the canvas shield of the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 20]: Somehow , this flimsy shelter , which sailors call the `` dodger , '' gave some sense of safety .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 28]: Her throbbing brain was incapable of lucid thought , but it was borne in on her mistily that the world and its occupants had suddenly gone mad .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 12]: The omen of the blood-red water had justified itself most horribly .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 10]: The dead carpenter was sprawling over the forecastle windlass .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 7]: His hand still clutched the brake .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 40]: The sailor at the wheel had been shot through the throat , and had fallen limply through the open doorway of the chart-room ; he lay there , coughing up blood and froth , and gasping his life out .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 30]: The two men wounded by the second shell were creeping down the forward companion in the effort to avoid the hail of lead that was beating on the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 22]: Hozier was raising himself on hands and knees , his attitude that of a man who is dazed , almost insensible .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 82]: Watts had gone from the bridge -- he might have been whirled to death over the side like the unfortunate foremast hand she had seen tossed from off the forecastle ; but Coke , whose charmed life apparently entitled him to act like a lunatic , was actually balancing himself on top of the starboard rails of the bridge by clinging to a stay , having climbed to that exposed position in order to hurl oaths at the soldiers on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 7]: He had gone berserk with rage .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 81]: His cap had either fallen off or been torn from his head by a bullet ; his squat , powerful figure was shaking with frenzy ; he emphasized each curse with a passionate gesture of the free hand and arm ; he said among other things , and with no lack of forceful adjectives , that if he could only come to close quarters with some of the Portygee assassins on the island he would tear their sanguinary livers out .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 16]: It is an odd thing that men made animal by fury often use that trope .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 6]: They do really mean it .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 11]: The liver is the earliest spoil of the successful tiger .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 35]: The _ Andromeda _ , uncontrollable as destiny , and quite as heedless of her human freight , swung round with the current until her bows pointed to the islet occupied by the marksmen .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 31]: All at once , Coke suspended his flow of invectives and rushed into the chart-room , where Iris heard him tearing lockers open and throwing their contents on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 16]: To enter , he was obliged to leap over the body of the dying man .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 46]: The action was grotesque , callous , almost inhuman ; it jarred the girl 's agonized transports back into a species of spiritual calm , a mental state akin to the fatalism often exhibited by Asiatics when death is imminent and not to be denied .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 56]: The apparent madness of the captain was now more distressing to her than the certain loss of the ship or the invisible missiles that clanged into white patches on the iron plates , cut sudden holes and scars in the woodwork , or whirred through the air with a buzzing whistle of singularly menacing sound .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 58]: She began to be afraid of remaining on the bridge ; her fear was not due to the really vital fact that it was so exposed ; it arose from the purely feminine consideration that she was sure Coke had become a raving maniac , and she dreaded meeting him when , if ever , he reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 22]: A bullet struck the front frame of the chart-room , and several panes of glass were shattered with a fearful din .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 4]: That decided her .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 14]: Coke , if he were not killed , would surely be driven out .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 18]: She sprang to her feet , and literally ran down the steep ladder to the saloon deck .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 33]: Through the open door of the officers ' mess she witnessed another bizarre act -- an act quite as extraordinary in its way as Coke 's jump over the steersman 's body .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 50]: In the midst of this drama of death and destruction , Watts was standing there , with head thrown back and uplifted arm , gulping down a tumblerful of some dark-colored liquid , draining it to the dregs , while he held a black bottle in the other hand .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 49]: That a man should fly to rum for solace when existence itself might be measured by minutes or seconds , was , to Iris , not the least amazing experience of an episode crammed with all that was new , and strange , and horrible in her life .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 21]: She raced on , wholly unaware that the drifting ship was now presenting her port bow to the death-dealing fusillade .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 22]: Then , from somewhere , she heard a gruff voice : `` Hev ' ye shut off steam , Macfarlane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 4]: `` Ou ay .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 18]: It 's a ' snug below till the watter reaches the furnaces , '' came the answer .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 10]: So some of the men were doing their duty .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 5]: Thank God for that !
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 42]: Undeterred by the fact that a live shell had burst among the engines , the oil-stained , grim-looking engineers had not quitted their post until they had taken such precautions as lay in their power to insure the ship 's safety .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 13]: A light broke in on the fog in the girl 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 17]: Even now , at the very gate of eternity , one might try to help others !
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 8]: The thought brought a ray of comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 22]: She was about to look for the speakers when a bullet drilled a hole in a panel close to her side .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 60]: She began to run again , for a terrified glance through the forward gangway showed that the ship was quite close to the land , where men in blue uniforms , wearing curiously shaped hats and white gaiters , were scattered among the rocks , some standing , some kneeling , some prone , but all taking steady aim .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 6]: But it showed something more .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 37]: Hozier was now lying sideways on the raised deck of the forecastle ; he partly supported himself on his right arm ; his left hand was pressed to his forehead ; he was trying to rise .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 32]: With an intuition that was phenomenal under the circumstances , Iris realized that he was screened from observation for the moment by the windlass and the corpse that lay across it .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 33]: But the ship 's ever increasing speed , and the curving course of her drifting , would soon bring him into sight , and then those merciless riflemen would shoot him down .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 6]: `` Oh , not that !
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 4]: Not that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 4]: she wailed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 17]: An impulse stronger than the instinct of self-preservation caused the blood to tingle in her veins .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 63]: She had waited to take that one look , and now , bent double so as to avoid being seen by the soldiers , she sped back through the gangway , gained the open deck , crouched close to the bulwarks on the port side , and thus reached unscathed the foot of the companion down which the wounded men had crawled .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 21]: The zinc plates on the steps were slippery with their blood , but she did not falter at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 18]: Up she went , stooped over Hozier , and placed her strong young arms round his body .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 4]: `` Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 9]: she panted , `` let me help you !
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 10]: You will be killed if you remain here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 11]: Her voice seemed to rouse him as from troubled sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 9]: `` I was hit , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 5]: `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 5]: What is wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 8]: `` Oh , come , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 22]: she screamed , for some unseen agency tore a transverse gash in the planking not a foot in front of them .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 6]: He yielded with broken expostulations .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 10]: She dragged him to the top of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 15]: Clinging to him , she half walked , half fell down the few steps .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 68]: But she did not quite fall ; Hozier 's weight was almost more than she could manage , but she clung to him desperately , saved him from a headlong plunge to the deck , and literally carried him into the forecastle , where she found some of the crew who had scurried there like rabbits to their burrow when the first shell crashed into the engine-room .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 9]: Iris 's fine eyes darted lightning at them .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 31]: `` You call yourselves men , '' she cried shrilly , `` yet you leave one of your officers lying on deck to be shot at by those fiends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 15]: `` We did n't know he was there , miss , '' said one .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 14]: `` We 'd ha ' fetched him right enough if we did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 16]: Even in her present stress of mixed emotions , the sailor 's words sounded reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 30]: Every other person on board was just as greatly stunned by this monstrous attack as she herself , and the firing now appeared to increase in volume and accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 14]: Several bullets clanged against the funnel or broke huge splinters off the boats .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 13]: `` Gord A'mighty , listen to that , '' growled a voice .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 26]: `` An ' we cooped up here , blazed at by a lot of rotten Dagos , with not a gun to our name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 21]: Iris was still supporting Hozier , whose head and shoulders were pillowed against her breast as she knelt behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 7]: `` Can nothing be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 9]: `` I believe Captain Coke has been killed .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 9]: Mr. Hozier is badly injured , I fear .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 8]: Bring some water , if possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 19]: `` Yes , yes , water ... Only a knock on the head ... How did it happen ?
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 9]: And what is that noise of firing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 21]: Hozier 's scattered wits were returning , though neither he nor Iris remembered that the _ Andromeda _ was waterless .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 21]: He looked up at her , then at the men , and he smiled as his eyes met hers again .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 5]: `` Funny thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 11]: he said , with a natural tone that was reassuring .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 10]: `` I thought the windlass smashed itself into smithereens .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 5]: But it could n't .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 7]: What was it that banged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 14]: `` A shell , fired from the island , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 6]: Hozier straightened himself a little .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 14]: He was hearing marvels , though far from understanding them , as yet .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 5]: `` A shell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 4]: he repeated vacantly .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 15]: Had she said `` a comet '' it could not have sounded more incredible .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 6]: It might have killed you .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 7]: Several of the men are dead .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 17]: I myself saw three of them killed outright , and two others are badly wounded . ''
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 21]: `` Here you are , sir -- drink this , '' said a fireman , offering a pannikin of beer .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 28]: It was unpalatable stuff , but it tasted like the nectar of the gods to one who had sustained a blow that would have felled an ox .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 24]: Hozier had almost emptied the tin when an exclamation from an Irish stoker drew all eyes to the after part of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 4]: `` Holy war !
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 7]: Will ye look at that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 4]: shouted the man .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 15]: `` Sure the skipper is n't dead , at all , at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 22]: Iris had failed to grasp the meaning of Coke 's antics in the chart-room , but they were now fully explained .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 15]: The bulldog breed of this self-confessed rascal had taken the upper hand of him .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 93]: Though he had not scrupled to plot the destruction of the ship , and thus rob a marine insurance company of a considerable sum of money -- though at that very instant there was actual proof of his scheme in the preparations he had made to jam the steering-gear when the anchor was raised after the tanks were replenished -- it was not in the man 's nature to skulk into comparative safety because a foreigner , a pirate , a not-to-be-mentioned-in-polite-society Portygee , opened fire on him in this murderous fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 11]: Moreover , Coke 's villainy would have sacrificed no lives .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 26]: The _ Andromeda _ might be converted into scrap iron , and thereby give back , by perverted arithmetic , the money invested in her .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 11]: But her white decks would not be stained with blood .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 16]: Whatever risk was incurred would be his , the responsible captain 's , his only .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 34]: It was a vastly different thing that shot and shell should be rained on an unarmed ship by the troops of a civilized power when she was seeking the lowest form of hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 35]: No wonder if the bull-necked skipper foamed at the mouth and used words forbidden by the catechism ; no wonder if he tried to express his helpless fury in one last act of defiance .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 22]: He rummaged the lockers for a Union Jack and the four flags that showed the ship 's name in signal letters .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 38]: The red ensign was already fluttering from a staff at the stern , and the house flag of David Verity & Co. was at the fore , but these emblems did not satisfy Coke 's fighting mettle .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 51]: The _ Andromeda _ would probably crack like an eggshell the instant she touched the reef towards which she was hurrying ; he determined that she would go down with colors flying if he were not put out of action by a bullet before he could reach the main halyard .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 17]: The swerve in the ship 's course as she passed the island gave him an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 31]: In justice to Coke it should be said that he recked naught of this , but it would have been humanly impossible otherwise for the soldiers to have missed him .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 38]: And now , while the vessel lay with straight keel in the set of the current , the national emblem of Britain , with the _ Andromeda 's _ code flags beneath , fluttered up the mainmast .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 26]: There are many imaginable conditions under which Coke 's deed would be regarded as sublime ; there are none which could deny his splendid audacity .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 34]: The soldiers , who seemed to be actuated by the utmost malevolence , redoubled their efforts to hit the squat Hercules who had bellowed at them and their fellow artillerists from the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 26]: Bullets struck the deck , lodged in the masts , splintered the roof and panels of the upper structure , but not one touched Coke .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 51]: He coolly made fast each flag in its turn , and hauled away till the Union Jack had reached the truck ; then , drawn forrard by a hoarse cheer that came from the forecastle , he turned his back on the enemy and swung himself down to the fore-deck .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 39]: He was still wearing the heavy garments demanded by the gale ; his recent exertions , joined to the fact that the normal temperature of a sub-tropical island was making itself felt , had induced a violent perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 33]: As he lumbered along the deck he mopped his face vigorously with a pocket handkerchief , and this homely action helped to convince Iris that she was mistaken in thinking him mad .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 19]: His words , too , when he caught sight of her , were not those of a maniac .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 18]: `` Well , missy , '' he cried , `` wot 'll they say in Liverpool now ?
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 37]: I s ` pose they 'll ` ear of this some day , '' and he jerked a thumb backwards to indicate the unceasing hail of bullets that poured into the after part of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 20]: The girl looked at him with an air of surprise that would have been comical under less grievous conditions .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 46]: She knew , with a vague definiteness , that death was near , perhaps unavoidable , and it had never occurred to her that she or any other person on board need feel any concern about the view entertained by Liverpool as to their fate .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 16]: Before she could frame a reply , however , Hozier seemed to recover his faculties .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 17]: He stood up , walked unaided to the side of the ship , and glanced ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 13]: `` Should n't we try to lower a boat , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 4]: he asked instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 7]: `` Wot 's the use ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 3]: growled Coke .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 21]: `` Oo 's goin ' to lower boats while them blighters on the island are pumpin ' lead into us ?
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 13]: And wot good are the boats w ` en they 're lowered ?
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 8]: They 've been drilled full of holes .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 10]: You might as well try to float a sieve .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 45]: Look at that , '' he added sarcastically , as the side of the cutter was ripped open by a ricochetting shot , and splinters were littered on the deck , `` they know wot they want an ' they mean to get it .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 6]: Dead men tell no tales .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 35]: It wo n't be anybody ` ere now who 'll ` ave the job of lettin ' the folk at ` ome know ` ow the pore ole _ Andromeda _ went under . ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 9]: `` Are none of the boats seaworthy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 4]: `` Not one .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 6]: They 're knocked to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 7]: Sorry for you , Miss Yorke .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 9]: But we 're all booked for Kingdom Come .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 27]: In ` arf a minnit , or less , we 'll be on the reef , an ' the ship must begin to break up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 28]: Coke was telling the plain truth , but Hozier ran aft to make sure that he was right in assuming the extent of the boats ' damages .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 28]: One of the men , an Italian , climbed to the forecastle deck in order to see more clearly what sort of danger they were running into .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 14]: He came back instantly , and his swarthy face was green with terror .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 17]: Though he spoke English well enough , he began to jabber wildly in his mother tongue .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 6]: None paid heed to him .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 70]: It was common knowledge that the vessel must be lost , and that those who still lived when she struck would have the alternatives of being drowned , or beaten to pieces against the frowning rocks , or shot from the mainland like so many stranded seals , if some alliance of luck and strength secured a momentary foothold on one of the tiny islets that barred the way .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 30]: And at such moments , when the mind is driven into a swift-running channel that ends in a cataract , elemental passions are apt to strive with elemental fears .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 13]: Few among these rough sailors had ever given thought to the future .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 23]: They had lived from hand to mouth , the demands of a hard and dangerous profession alternating with bouts of foolish revelry .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 21]: Most of them had looked on death in the tempest , in the swirling seas , in the uplifted knife .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 56]: But then , there was always a chance of escape , an open door for the stout heart and ready hand ; whereas , under present conditions , there was nothing to be done but pray , or curse , or wait in stoic silence until the first ominous quiver ran through the swift-moving ship .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 67]: So , all unknowingly , they grouped themselves according to their nationalities , for the Latins knelt and supplicated the saints and the Virgin Mother , the Celts roared insensate threats at the islanders who had thrown them into the very jaws of eternity , and the Saxons stood motionless , with grim jaws and frowning brows , disdaining alike both frenzied appeal and useless execration .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 21]: Someone threw a cork jacket over the girl 's shoulders , and bade her fasten its straps around her waist .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 6]: She obeyed without a word .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 12]: Indeed , she seemed to have lost the power of speech .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 24]: Everything had suddenly assumed such a crystal clear aspect that her eyes were gifted with unnatural vision though her remaining senses were benumbed .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 44]: The blue and white of the sky , the emerald green of the water , the russet brown and cold gray of the land -- these shone now with a beauty vivid beyond any of nature 's tints she had ever before seen .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 11]: She was conscious , too , of an awful aloofness .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 9]: Her spirit was entrenched in its own citadel .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 44]: She seemed to be brooding , solitary and remote , yet shrinking ever within herself ; quite unknowing , she offered a piteous example of the old Hebrew 's dire truism that man came naked into the world and naked shall he depart .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 13]: In a curiously detached way she wondered why Hozier did not return .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 15]: The prayers and curses of the men surrounding her fell unheeded on her ears .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 4]: Where was Hozier ?
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 5]: What was he doing ?
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 8]: Why did he not come to her ?
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 8]: She felt a strange confidence in him .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 30]: If he had not been struck down by that calamitous shell he would have saved the ship -- assuredly he would have devised some means of saving their lives !
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 12]: Perhaps , even now , he was attempting some desperate expedient !
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 9]: ... The thought nerved her for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 25]: Then a rending , grinding noise was followed by a sudden swerve and roll of the ship that sent her staggering against a bulkhead .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 21]: An outburst of cries and shouting rang through her brain , and a shriek was wrung from her parched throat .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 27]: But the _ Andromeda _ righted herself again , though there was another sound of tearing metal , and the deck heaved perceptibly under a shock .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 5]: Ah , kind Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 11]: here came Hozier , running , thundering some loud order .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 8]: `` The port life-boat ... seaworthy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 11]: There was a fierce rush , in which she joined .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 5]: She was knocked down .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 9]: A strong hand dragged her to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 7]: It was Coke , swearing horribly .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 10]: She saw Hozier leap against the flood of men .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 11]: `` D -- n you , the woman first ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 21]: she heard him say , and he sent the leaders of the mob sprawling over the hatches of the forehold .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 20]: Coke , almost carrying her in his left arm , butted in among the crew like an infuriated bull .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 12]: Some of the men , shamefaced , made way for them .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 4]: Hosier reached her .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 22]: She thought he said to the captain : `` There 's a chance , if we can swing her clear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 14]: Then the ship struck , and they were all flung to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 30]: They rose , somehow , anyhow , but the _ Andromeda _ , apparently resenting the check , lifted herself bodily , tilted bow upward , and struck again .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 21]: A mass of spray dashed down upon the struggling figures who had been driven a second time to their knees .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 33]: There was a terrific explosion in the after-hold , for the deck had burst under the pressure of air , and another ominous roar announced that the water had reached the furnaces .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 24]: Steam and smoke and dust mingled with the incessant lashing of sheets of spray , and Iris was torn from Coke 's grip .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 12]: She fancied she heard Hozier cry , `` Too late ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 22]: and a lightning glimpse down the sloping deck showed some of the engineers and stokers crawling up toward the quivering forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 16]: She felt herself clasped in Hozier 's arms , and knew that he was climbing .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 43]: After a few breathless seconds she realized that they were standing on the forecastle , where the captain and many of the crew were clinging to the windlass , and anchor , and cable , and bulwarks , to maintain their footing .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 21]: Below , beyond a stretch of unbroken deck , the sea raged against all that was left of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 13]: The bridge just showed above the froth and spume of sea level .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 22]: The funnel still held by its stays , but the mainmast was gone , and with it the string of flags .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 7]: The noise was deafening , overpowering .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 57]: It sounded like the rattle of some immense factory ; yet a voice was audible through the din , for Hozier was telling her not to abandon hope , as the fore part of the ship was firmly wedged into a cleft in the rocks : they might still have a chance when the tide dropped .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 17]: So that explained why it was so dark where a few moments ago all was light .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 17]: Iris pressed the salt water out of her burning eyes , and tried to look up .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 19]: On both sides of the narrow triangle of the forecastle rose smooth overhanging walls , black and dripping .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 39]: They were festooned with seaweed , and every wave that curled up between the ship 's plates and the rocks was thrown back over the deck , while streams of water fell constantly from the masses of weed .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 5]: She gasped for breath .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 27]: The mere sight of this dismal cleft with its super-saturated air space made active the choking sensation of which she was just beginning to be aware .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 8]: `` I -- can not breathe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 27]: she sobbed , and she would have slipped off into the welter of angry foam beneath had not Hozier tightened a protecting arm round her waist .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 5]: `` Stoop down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 20]: She had a dim knowledge that he unbuttoned his coat and drew one of its folds over her head .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 8]: Ah , the blessed relief of it !
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 16]: Freed from the stifling showers of spray , she drew a deep breath or two .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 7]: How good he was to her !
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 22]: How sure she was now that if he had been spared by that disabling shell he would have saved them all !
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 14]: Bent and shrouded as she was , she could see quite clearly downward .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 9]: The ship was breaking up with inconceivable rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 22]: Already there was a huge irregular vent between the fore deck and the central block of cabins topped by the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 13]: And a new horror was added to all that had gone before .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 10]: Swarms of rats were skimming up the slippery planks .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 10]: They were invading the forecastle and the forecastle deck .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 29]: They came in an irresistible army , though , fortunately for Iris 's continued sanity , the greater number scurried into the darkness of the men 's quarters .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 38]: She was watching them with fascinated eyes , though not daring to withdraw her head from under the coat , when she heard a ghastly yell from beneath , and an erie face appeared above the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 10]: It was Watts , mad with fright and drink .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 4]: `` Save me !
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 4]: save me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 26]: he screamed , and the girl shuddered as she realized that the man did not fear death so much as he loathed the scampering rats .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 39]: He had no difficulty in climbing the steep companion , though , by reason of the present position of all that was left of the _ Andromeda _ , its pitch was thrown back to an unusual angle .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 8]: He scrambled up , a pitiable object .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 26]: A couple of rats ran over his body , and as each whisked across his shoulders and past his cheek he uttered a blood-curdling yell .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 24]: A big wave surged up into the recesses of the cleft and was flung off in a drenching shower on to the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 24]: It nearly swept Watts into the next world , and it drove every rodent in that exposed place back to the dry interior .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 25]: To return , they had to use the unhappy chief officer as a causeway , and the poor wretch 's despairing cries were heartrending .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 27]: He was clinging for dear life to a bolt in the deck when Coke joined hands with a sailor and was thus enabled to reach him .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 70]: Once the skipper 's strong fingers had clutched his collar he was rescued -- at least from the instant death that might have been the outcome of his abject terror , for there could be little doubt in the minds of those who saw his glistening eyes and drawn lips that it would have needed the passage of but one more rat and he would have relaxed his hold .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 16]: Coke pulled him up until he was lodged in safety in front of the windlass .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 20]: The manner of the welcome given by the captain to his _ aide _ need not be recorded here .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 66]: It was curt and lurid ; it would serve as a sorry passport if proffered on his entry to another world ; but the tragi-comedy of Watts 's appearance among the close-packed gathering on the forecastle was forthwith blotted out of existence by a thing so amazing , so utterly unlooked for that during a couple of spellbound seconds not a man moved nor spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 32]: CHAPTER V THE REFUGEES Watts was whimpering some broken excuse to his angry skipper when a coil of stout rope fell on top of the windlass and rebounded to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 20]: More than that , one end of it stretched into the infinity of dripping rock and flying spray overhead .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 9]: And it had been thrown by friendly hands .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 41]: Though it dangled from some unseen ledge , its purpose seemed to be that of help rather than slaughter , whereas every other act of the inhabitants of Fernando Noronha had been suggestive of homicidal mania in its worst form .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 11]: Coke and Hozier recovered the use of their faculties simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 18]: The eyes of the two men met , but Coke was the first to find his voice .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 9]: `` Salvage , by G -- d ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 7]: `` Up you go , Hozier !
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 8]: I 'll sling the girl behind you .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 26]: She ca n't manage it alone , an ' it needs someone with brains to fix things up there for the rest of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 15]: And he added hoarsely in Philip 's ear : `` Sharp 's the word .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 8]: We ` ave n't many minutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 5]: Philip made no demur .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 21]: The captain 's strong common sense had suggested the best step that could be taken in the interests of all .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 51]: Iris , who was nearer yielding now that there was a prospect of being rescued than when death was clamoring at her feet among the trembling remains of the ship , silently permitted Coke and a sailor to strip off a life-belt and tie her and Hozier back to back .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 29]: It was wonderful , though hidden from her ken in that supreme moment , to see how they devised a double sling in order to distribute the strain .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 16]: When each knot was securely fastened , Coke vociferated a mighty `` Heave away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 42]: But his powerful voice was drowned by the incessant roar of the breakers ; not even the united clamor of every man present , fifteen all told , including the drunken chief officer , could make itself heard above the din .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 15]: Then Hozier tugged sharply at the rope three times , and it grew taut .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 18]: Amid a jubilant cry from the others , he and Iris were lifted clear of the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 11]: At once they were carried fully twenty feet to seaward .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 57]: As they swung back , not quite so far , and now well above the level of the windlass from which their perilous journey had started , a ready-witted sailor seized a few coils of a thin rope that lay tucked up in the angle of the bulwarks , and flung them across Hozier 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 10]: `` Take a whip with you , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 17]: he yelled , and Philip showed that he understood by gripping the rope between his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 46]: It was obvious that the rescuers were working from a point well overhanging the recess into which the _ Andromeda _ had driven her bows , and there might still be the utmost difficulty in throwing a rope accurately from the rock to the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 43]: As a matter of fact , no less than six previous attempts had been made , and the success of the seventh was due solely to a favorable gust of wind hurtling into the cleft at the very instant it was needed .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 12]: The sailor 's quick thought solved this problem for the future .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 27]: By tying the small rope to the heavier one , those who remained below could haul it back when some sort of signal code was established .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 27]: At present , all they could do was to pay out the whip , and take care that it did not interfere with Hozier 's ascent .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 52]: They soon lost sight of him and the girl , for the spray and froth overhead formed an impenetrable canopy , but they reasoned that the distance to be traveled could not be great ; otherwise the throwing of a rope would have been a physical impossibility in the first instance .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 6]: Once there was a check .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 22]: They waited anxiously , but there was no sign given by the frail rope that they were to haul in again .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 6]: Then the upward movement continued .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 24]: `` Chunk o ' rock in the way , '' announced Coke , glaring round at the survivors as if to challenge contradiction .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 4]: No one answered .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 29]: These men were beginning to measure their lives against the life of the wedge of iron and timber kept in position by the crumbling frame of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 6]: It was a fast-diminishing scale .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 16]: The figures painted on the _ Andromeda 's _ bows represented minutes rather than feet .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 15]: Watts was lying crouched on deck , with his arms thrown round the windlass .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 32]: Looking ever for a fresh incursion of rats , he seemed to be cheered by the fact that his dreaded assailants preferred the interior of the forecastle to the wave-swept deck .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 13]: He was the only man there who had no fear of death .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 11]: Suddenly he began to croon a long-forgotten sailor 's chanty .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 28]: Perhaps , in some dim way , a notion of his true predicament had dawned on him , for there was a sinister purport to the verse .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 80]: `` Now , me lads , sing a stave of the Dead Man 's Mass ; Ye 'll never sail ` ome again , O. We 're twelve old salts an ' the skipper 's lass , Marooned in the Spanish Main , O. Sing hay -- Sing ho -- A nikker is Davy Jones , Just one more plug , an ' a swig at the jug , An ' up with the skull an ' bones . ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 19]: After a longer and faster haul than had been noticed previously , the rope stopped a second time .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 11]: Everyone , except Watts , was watching the whip intently .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 9]: His eyes peered around , wide-open , lusterless .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 17]: The pounding of the seas , the grating of iron on rock , left him unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 14]: `` Wy do n't you jine in the chorus , you swabs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 11]: he cried , and forthwith plunged into the second stanza .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 77]: `` The _ Alice _ brig sailed out of the Pool For the other side of the world , O , An ' our ole man brought ` is gal from school , With ` er ` air so brown an ' curled , O. Sing hum -- Sing hum -- Of death no man 's a dodger , An ' we squared our rig for a yardarm jig When we sighted the Jolly Roger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 18]: He grew quite uproarious because the lilting tune evoked neither applause nor vocal efforts from the others .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 8]: `` Lord luv ' a duck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 10]: `` Ca n't any of ye lend a hand ?
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 62]: Cheer O , maties -- ` ere 's a bit more -- The brig was becalmed in a sea like glass , An ' it gev ' us all the creeps , O , Wen the sun went down like a ball o ' brass , An ' the pirate rigged ` is sweeps -- '' `` There she goes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 32]: yelled the sailor in charge of the line ; he began to haul in the slack like a madman ; Coke 's fist fell heavily on the singer 's right ear .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 18]: `` Wen your turn comes , I 'll tie the rope round your bloomin ' neck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 22]: he growled vindictively , though his eyes continued to search the dark shroud overhead that inclosed them as in a tomb .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 9]: A dark form loomed downward through the mist .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 11]: It was Hozier , alone , coming back to them .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 12]: A frenzied cheer broke from the lips of those overwrought men .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 6]: They knew what that meant .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 20]: Somewhere , high above the black rocks and the flying scud , was hope throned in the blessed sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 14]: They drew him in cautiously until Coke was able to grasp his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 16]: They were quick to see that he brought a second rope and a spare whip .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 15]: `` Two at a time on both ropes , '' was his inspiriting message .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 32]: `` They 're friendly Portuguese up there , but no one must be seen if a boat is sent from the island to find out what has become of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 4]: So step lively !
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 11]: Now , Captain , tell 'em off in pairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 6]: Coke 's method was characteristic .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 14]: He literally fell on the two nearest men and began to truss them .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 13]: Hozier followed his example , and tied two others back to back .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 14]: They vanished , and the ropes returned , much more speedily this time .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 12]: Four , and four again , were drawn up to safety .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 37]: There were left the captain , Hozier , and the unhappy Watts , who was now crying because the skipper had `` set about '' him , just for singin ' a reel ole wind-jammer song .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 23]: `` You must take up this swine , '' said Coke to Hozier , dragging Watts to his feet with scant ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 20]: `` If I lay me ` ands on ` im I 'll be tempted to throttle ` im . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 7]: Watts protested vigorously against being tied .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 20]: He vowed that it was contrary to articles for a chief officer to be treated in such a fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 32]: He howled most dolorously during his transit through mid-air , but was happily quieted by another sharp rap on the head resulting from his inability to climb over the obstructing rock .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 19]: Before quitting the deck , Hozier helped to adjust the remaining rope around the captain 's portly person .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 19]: They were lifted clear of the trembling forecastle almost simultaneously , and in the very nick of time .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 17]: Already the skeleton of the ship 's hull was beginning to slip off into deep water .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 20]: The deck was several feet lower than at the moment of the vessel 's final impact against the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 73]: Even before the three reached the ledge from which their rescuers were working , the bridge and funnel were swept away , the foremast fell , the forehold and forecastle were riotously flooded by the sea , and Watts , were he capable of using his eyes , might have seen his deadly enemies , the rats , swarming in hundreds to the tiny platform that still rose above the destroying waves .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 9]: Soon , even that frail ark was shattered .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 42]: When keel and garboard stroke plates snapped , all that was left of the _ Andromeda _ toppled over , and the cavern she had invaded rang with a fierce note of triumph as the next wave thundered in without hindrance .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 29]: * * * * * * It was , indeed , a new and strange world on which Iris looked when able to breathe and see once more .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 14]: During that terrible ascent she had retained but slight consciousness of her surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 71]: She knew that Hozier and herself were drawn close to a bulging rock , that her companion clutched at it with hands and knees , and thus fended her delicate limbs from off its broken surface ; she felt herself half carried , half lifted , up into free air and dazzling light ; she heard voices in a musical foreign tongue uttering words that had the ring of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 9]: And that was all for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 22]: Friendly hands placed her in a warm and sunlit cleft , and she lay there , unable to think or move .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 15]: By degrees , the numbness of body and mind gave way to clearer impressions .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 7]: But she took much for granted .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 41]: For instance , it did not seem an unreasonable thing that the familiar faces of men from the _ Andromeda _ should gather near her on an uneven shelf of rock strewn with broken bolders and the litter of sea-birds .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 13]: She recognized them vaguely , and their presence brought a new confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 59]: They increased in number ; sailor-like , they began to take part instantly in the work of rescue ; but she wondered dully why Hozier did not come to her , nor did she understand that he had gone back to that raging inferno beneath until she saw his blood-stained face appear over the lip of the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 9]: Then she screamed wildly : `` Thank God !
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 6]: Oh , thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 23]: and staggered to her feet in the frantic desire to help in unfastening the ropes that bound him to the insensible Watts .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 20]: One of the men tried to persuade her to sit down again , but she would not be denied .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 30]: Her unaccustomed fingers strove vainly against the stiff strands , swollen as they were with wet , and drawn taut by the strain to which they had been subjected .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 8]: Tears gushed forth at her own helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 8]: The pain in her eyes blinded her .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 5]: She shrank away again .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 36]: Not until Philip himself spoke did she dare to look at him , to find that he was bending over her , and endeavoring to allay her agitation by repeated assurance of their common well-being .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 14]: But her distraught brain was not yet equal to a complexity of thought .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 30]: Watts was lying close to her feet , and it thrilled her with dread and contempt when Coke bestowed a well-considered kick on his chief officer 's prostrate form .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 8]: `` Oh , how dare you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 9]: she cried , indignant as an offended goddess .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 40]: `` Sorry , miss , '' said Coke , scowling as if he were inclined to repeat the assault , though he was not then aware of the more strenuous method adopted by the rock as a sobering agent .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 9]: `` I did n't know you was there .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 40]: But ' e fair gev ' me a turn , ' e did , singin ' ` is pot - ` ouse crambos w ` en we was in the very jors of death , so to speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 21]: `` He must not sing , '' she announced gravely , `` but really you should not kick him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 43]: `` Come , Miss Yorke , '' broke in Hozier , who was choking back a laugh that was nearer hysteria than he dreamed , `` our Portuguese friends say we must not remain here an instant longer than is necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' said a strange voice , `` the sea is moderating .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 8]: At any moment a boat may appear .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 7]: Follow me , all of you .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 14]: The road is a rough one , but it is not far . ''
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 50]: The speaker was an elderly man , long-haired and bearded , of whose personality the girl caught no other details than the patriarchal beard , a pair of remarkably bright eyes , a long , pointed nose , and a red scar that ran diagonally across a domed forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 28]: He turned away without further explanation , and began to climb a natural pathway that wound itself up the side of an almost perpendicular wall of rock .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 19]: Hozier caught Iris by the arm , and would have assisted her , but she shook herself free .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 12]: She felt , and conducted herself , like a fractious child .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 15]: `` I can manage quite well , '' she said with an odd petulance .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 9]: `` Please look after that unfortunate Mr. Watts .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 14]: I am not surprised that he should have been frightened by the rats .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 6]: They terrified me , too .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 17]: Oh , how awful they were -- in the dark -- when their eyes shone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 17]: Her mind had traveled back to the two nights and a day passed in the lazaretto .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 11]: She sobbed bitterly , and stumbled over a steep ledge .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 12]: She would have fallen were it not for Philip 's help .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 11]: `` Watts is all right , '' he soothed her .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 10]: `` Two of the men are seeing to him .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 8]: And the rats are all gone now .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 6]: There are none here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 5]: `` Quite sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 7]: `` What became of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 14]: `` They are all -- we left them behind on the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 6]: Suddenly she clung to him .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 16]: `` Do n't let them send me back to the ship , '' she implored .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 6]: You are safe now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 13]: `` Of course I am safe , but I dread that ship .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 8]: Why did I ever come on board ?
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 8]: Captain Coke said he would sink her .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 8]: I told you -- '' `` Steady !
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 10]: Keep a little nearer the rocks on your left .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 7]: The passage is narrow here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 11]: Hozier raised his voice somewhat , and purposely hurried her .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 8]: But she was not to be repressed .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 4]: `` Poor ship !
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 14]: What had she done that she should be battered on the rocks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 37]: `` You must not talk , '' he said firmly , well knowing that if the sailors and firemen lumbering close behind had not heard her earlier comment it was due solely to the blustering wind .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 17]: They were skirting the seaward face of the rocky islet on which they had found salvation .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 15]: The sun was blazing at them sideways from a wide expanse of blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 20]: The rear guard clouds of the gale were scurrying away over the horizon in front of their upward path .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 10]: Somehow , Philip 's sailor 's brain was befogged .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 9]: Those clouds must have blown to the northeast .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 20]: If that were so , what was the sun doing in the southeast at this time of the day ?
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 24]: It had hardly budged a point from the quarter in which some fitful gleams shone when that mad thing happened near the windlass .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 30]: Thinking he was still dizzy from the effects of the blow , which the girl had ascribed to the bursting of a shell , Philip glanced at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 7]: It was twenty-five minutes past eight !
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 25]: Yet he distinctly remembered eight bells being struck while Coke was telling him from the bridge to give the anchor thirty-five fathoms of cable .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 15]: Was it possible that they had gone through so much during those few minutes ?
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 19]: If he were really light-headed , then sun and clouds and watch were conspiring to keep him so .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 13]: Iris , chilled by his stern tone , nevertheless noted his action .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 26]: Still unable to concentrate her thoughts on more than one topic , and that to the exclusion of all else , she asked the time .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 4]: He told her .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 38]: He awaited some expression of surprise on her part , provided it were , indeed , true that only twenty-five minutes had sped since the _ Andromeda _ was quietly preparing to drop anchor off South Point .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 8]: But she received his news without comment .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 25]: She would have been equally undisturbed if told it was midnight , and that the vessel had gone ashore on the coast of China .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 11]: Just then the track turned sharply away from the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 26]: A dry water-course cut deeply into the cliff where torrential rains had found an upright layer of soft scoria imbedded in the mass of basalt .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 17]: Their guide was standing on the sky-line of the cleft , some forty feet above them .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 12]: `` Tell the others to make haste , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 10]: `` This is the end of your journey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 30]: It did not strike either Hozier or the girl as being specially remarkable that a man should meet them in this extraordinary place and address them in good English .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 15]: Iris , at any rate , gave no heed to this most amazing fact .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 30]: She merely observed for the first time that the elderly stranger , while dressed in a beggar 's rags , assumed an air of command that was almost ludicrous .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 6]: `` Who is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 12]: she asked , being rather breathless now after a steep climb .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' said Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 5]: `` How absurd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 9]: `` I -- I think I 'm dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 9]: Why -- have we -- come here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 12]: She heard a coarse chuckle from Coke , not far below .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 14]: `` Let ` im cough it up , '' the skipper was saying .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 8]: `` It 'll do ` im good .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 28]: I 've seen ` im blind many a time , but ` ow any man could dope ` isself in that shape in less 'n two minutes !
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 11]: -- Well , it fair gives me the go-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 3]: Two minutes !
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 15]: Hozier listened , and he was recovering his wits far more rapidly than Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 15]: Was the skipper , then , in league with nature herself to perplex him ?
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 5]: And Watts , too ?
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 11]: Why did Coke hint so coarsely that he was drunk ?
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 27]: He was on the bridge while he , Philip , was attending to the lead , and at that time the chief officer was perfectly sober .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 13]: Iris , once again , was deeply incensed by Coke 's brutality .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 5]: `` Horrid man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 13]: she murmured , but she had no breath left for louder protest .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 18]: It was hot as a furnace in this narrow ravine ; each upward step demanded an effort .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 40]: She would have slipped and hurt herself many times were it not for Hozier 's firm grasp , nor did she realize the sheer exhaustion that forced him to seek support from the neighboring wall with his disengaged hand .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 14]: The man in front , however , was alive to their dangerous plight .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 26]: He said something in his own language -- for his English had the precise staccato accent of the well-educated foreigner -- and another man appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 28]: The sight of the newcomer startled Iris more than any other event that had happened since the _ Andromeda _ reached the end of her last voyage .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 16]: He wore the uniform of those dreadful beings whom she had seen on the island .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 40]: She shrieked ; Hozier fancied she had sprained an ankle ; but before she could utter any sort of explanation the apparition in uniform was by her side , and murmuring words that were evidently meant to be reassuring .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 13]: Seeing that he was not understood , he broke into halting French .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 6]: `` Courage , madame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 20]: `` Il faut monter -- encore un peu -- et donc -- vous √™tes arriv√© ... √áa y est !
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 2]: Voil√° !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 4]: Comptez sur moi .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 9]: Juste ciel , mais c'est affreux l'escalier . ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 23]: But he worked while he poured out this medley , and Iris was standing on level ground ere he made an end .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 46]: He was a handsome youngster , evidently an officer , and his eyes dwelt on the girl 's face with no lack of animation as he led her into a cave which seemed to have been excavated from the inner side of a small crater .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 15]: `` You can rest here in absolute safety , madame , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 8]: `` Permit me to arrange a seat .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 9]: Then I shall bring you some wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 12]: Iris flung off the hand which held her arm so persuasively .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 8]: `` Please do not attend to me .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 37]: There are wounded men who need attention far more than I , '' she said , speaking in English , since it never entered her mind that the Portuguese officer had been addressing her in French .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 51]: He was puzzled more by her action than her words , but Hozier , who had followed close behind , explained in sentences built on the Ollendorffian plan that mademoiselle was disturbed , mademoiselle required rest , mademoiselle hardly understood that which had arrived , _ et voil√° tout _ .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 15]: The other man smiled comprehension , though he scanned Hozier with a quick underlook .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 7]: `` Is monsieur the captain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 9]: `` No , monsieur the captain comes now .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 5]: Here he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 15]: `` Mademoiselle , without doubt , is the daughter of monsieur the captain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 26]: `` No , '' said Hozier , rather curtly , turning to ascertain how Iris had disposed of herself in the interior of the cavern .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 59]: It was his first experience of a South American dandy 's pose towards women , or , to be exact , toward women who are young and pretty , and it seemed to him not the least marvelous event of an hour crammed with marvels that any man should endeavor to begin an active flirtation under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 11]: He saw that Iris was seated on a camp stool .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 8]: Her face was buried in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 40]: A wealth of brown hair was tumbled over her neck and shoulders ; the constant showers of spray had loosened her tresses , and the unavoidable rigors of the passage from ship to ledge had shaken out every hairpin .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 23]: The Tam o ' Shanter cap she was wearing early in the day had disappeared at some unknown stage of the adventure .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 9]: Her attitude bespoke a mood of overwhelming dejection .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 16]: Like the remainder of her companions in misfortune , she was drenched to the skin .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 43]: That physical drawback , however , was only a minor evil in this almost unpleasantly hot retreat ; but Hozier , able now to focus matters in fairly accurate proportion , felt that Iris had not yet plumbed the depths of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 15]: Their trials were far from ended when their feet rested on the solid rock .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 12]: There was every indication that their rescuers were refugees like themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 52]: The scanty resources visible in the cave , the intense anxiety of the elderly Portuguese to avoid observation from the chief island of the group , the very nature of the apparently inaccessible crag in which he and his associates were hiding -- each and all of these things spoke volumes .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 28]: Hozier did not attempt to disturb the girl until the dapper officer produced a goatskin , and poured a small quantity of wine into a tin cup .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 13]: With a curious eagerness , he anticipated the other 's obvious intent .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 27]: `` Pardon me , monsieur , '' he said , seizing the vessel , and his direct Anglo-Saxon manner quite robbed his French of its politeness .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 24]: Then his vocabulary broke down , and he added more suavely in English : `` I will persuade her to drink a little .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 9]: She is rather hysterical , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 8]: The Portuguese nodded as though he understood .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 10]: Iris looked up when Hozier brought her the cup .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 42]: The mere suggestion of something to drink made active the parched agony of mouth and throat , but her wry face when she found that the liquid was wine might have been amusing if the conditions of life were less desperate .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 7]: `` Is there no water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 4]: she asked plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 20]: The officer , who was following the little by-play with his eyes , realized the meaning of her words .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 12]: `` We have no water , mademoiselle , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 10]: Then he glanced at the group of bedraggled sailors .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 10]: `` And very little wine , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 9]: `` Please drink it , '' urged Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 27]: `` You are greatly run down , you know , though you really ought to feel cheerful , since you have escaped with your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 11]: `` I feel quite brave , '' said Iris simply .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 46]: `` I would never have believed that I could go through -- all that , '' and her childish trick of listening to the booming of the distant breakers told him how vivid was her recollection of the horrors crowded into those few brief minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 18]: `` Be quick , please , '' put in the elderly Portuguese with a tinge of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 32]: `` We have no second cup , and there are wounded men -- '' `` Give it to them , '' said Iris , lifting her face again for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 7]: `` I do not need it .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 8]: I have told you that once already .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 11]: I suppose you think I should not be here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 23]: `` I am sure our friend did not mean that , '' said Hozier , looking squarely into those singularly bright eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 6]: He caught and held them .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 29]: `` I did not mean that the lady should be left to die if that is the interpretation put on my remark , '' came the quiet answer .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 20]: `` But it was an act of the utmost folly to bring a delicate girl on such an errand .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 17]: I can not imagine what your captain was thinking of when he agreed to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 8]: `` Wot 's that , mister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 3]: demanded Coke .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 24]: Now that his fit of rage had passed , the bulky skipper of the _ Andromeda _ was red-faced and imperturbable as usual .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 31]: The manifold perils he had passed through showed no more lasting effect on him than a shower of sleet on the thick hide of the animal he so closely resembled .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 9]: `` Are _ you _ the captain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 4]: said the other .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 40]: An ' I 'd like to ` ear w ' y my ship or ` er present trip was n't fit for enny young leddy , let alone -- '' `` That is a matter for you to determine .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 12]: I suppose you know best how to conduct your own business .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 11]: My only concern is with the outcome of your rashness .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 12]: Why did you deliberately sacrifice your ship in that manner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 20]: The speaker 's cut-glass style of English left his hearers in no doubt as to what he had said .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 31]: During the tense silence that reigned for a few seconds even some among the crew pricked their ears , while Hozier and Iris forgot other troubles in their new bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 22]: There were reasons why the drift of the stranger 's words should be laid deeply to heart by three people present .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 25]: Coke , at any rate , found himself nearer a state of pallid nervousness than ever before in the course of a variegated life .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 26]: It was impossible that he should actually grow pale , but his brick-red features assumed a purple tint , and his fiery little eyes glinted .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 11]: `` Wot are you a-drivin ' at , mister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 19]: he growled at last , after trying vainly to expectorate and compromising the effort in a husky gargle .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 14]: `` Do you deny , then , that you acted like a madman ?
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 26]: Do you say that you did not know quite well the risk you ran in bringing your vessel to the island in broad daylight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 6]: Then Coke found his breath .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 4]: `` Risk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 18]: `` Risk in steamin ' to an anchorage an ' sendin ' a boat ashore for water ?
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 46]: There seems to be a lot of mad folk loose just now on Fernando Noronha , but I 'm not one of 'em , an ' that 's as much as I can say for enny of you -- damme if it ai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 19]: Evidently the Portuguese was not accustomed to the direct form of conversation in vogue among British master mariners .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 35]: He bent his piercing gaze on Coke 's angry if somewhat flustered countenance , and there was a perceptible stiffening of voice and manner when he said : `` Who are you , then ?
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 6]: Who sent you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 50]: `` I 'm Captain James Coke , of the British ship _ Andromeda _ , that 's ` oo _ I _ am , an ' I was sent ` ere , or leastways to the River Plate , by David Verity an ' Co. , of Liverpool . ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 36]: It must not be forgotten that Coke shared with his employer a certain unclassical freedom in the pronunciation of the ship 's name ; the long `` e '' apparently puzzled the other man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 5]: _ Andromeeda _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 5]: `` Spell it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 22]: `` My godfather , this is an asylum for sure , '' grunted Coke , in a spasm of furious mirth .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 3]: `` A-n-d-r-o-m-e-d-a .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 6]: Now you 've got it .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 8]: Ai n't it up to Portygee standard ?
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 2]: A-n-d-r-o-m-e-d-a !
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 13]: ` Ow 's that for the bloomin ' spellin ' bee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 8]: But Coke 's humor made no appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 27]: The staring , brilliant eyes fixed on him did not relax their vigilance , nor did any trace of emotion exhibit itself in that calm voice .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 15]: `` You are unlucky , Captain Coke , most unlucky , '' it said .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 22]: `` I regret my natural mistake , which , it seems , was shared by the authorities of Fernando do Noronha .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 21]: You have blundered into a nest of hornets , and , as a result , you have been badly stung .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 5]: Let me explain matters .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 15]: I am Dom Corria Antonio De Sylva , ex-President of the Republic of Brazil .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 49]: There is , at this moment , a determined movement on foot on the mainland to replace me in power , and , with that object in view , efforts are being made to secure my escape from the convict settlement in which my enemies have imprisoned me .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 10]: I and two faithful followers are here in hiding .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 48]: My friend , Capitano Salvador De San Benavides , '' and he bowed with much dignity toward the uniformed officer , `` came here two days ago in a felucca to warn me that a steamer would lie to about a mile south of the island to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 34]: The steamer 's name is _ Andros-y-Mela _ -- it is rather like the name of your unhappy vessel -- so much alike that the _ Andromeda _ has been sunk by mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 5]: That is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 27]: Coke , listening to this explanation with the virtuous wrath of a knave who discovers that he has been wrongfully suspected , bristled now with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 11]: `` Oh , that 's all , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 4]: he cried sarcastically .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 17]: `` No , sir , it ai n't all , nor ` arf , nor quarter .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 55]: Let me tell you that no crimson pirate on Gawd 's earth can blow a British ship off the ` igh seas an ' then do the dancin ' - master act , with ` is ` and on ` is ` eart , an ' say it was just a flamin ' mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 2]: All !
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 3]: says you ?
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 6]: Do n't you believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 54]: There 's a lot more to come yet , take my tip -- a devil of a lot , or I 'm the biggest lunatic within a ten-mile circle of w ` ere I 'm stannin ' , which is givin ' long odds to any other crank in the whole creation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 62]: And Coke was right , though he little guessed then why he was so thoroughly justified in assuming that he and the other survivors of the _ Andromeda _ had not yet gone through half , or quarter , or more than a mere curtain-raising prelude to the strange human drama in which they were destined to be the chief actors .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 16]: CHAPTER VI BETWEEN THE BRAZILIAN DEVIL AND THE DEEP ATLANTIC There was an awkward pause .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 15]: Coke , rascal though he was , and pot-bellied withal , was no Falstaff .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 26]: Rather did he suggest the present-day atavism of some robber baron of the Middle Ages , whose hectoring speech bubbled forth from a stout heart .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 8]: But the ragged ex-President heeded him not .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 52]: After a moment of placid scrutiny of his enraged countenance by those bright , watchful eyes , Coke might have been non-existent so far as recognition of his outburst was apparent during the sonorous discussion that ensued between Dom Corria Antonio De Sylva and the Se√±or Capitano Salvador De San Benavides .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 10]: The latter , it is true , betrayed excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 30]: At first he favored Iris with a deprecatingly admiring glance , as one who would say , `` Dear lady , accept my profound regret and respectful homage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 6]: But that phase quickly passed .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 27]: His leader was not a man to waste words , and the gallant captain 's expressive face soon showed that he had grasped the essential facts .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 6]: They did not please him .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 17]: In fact , he was distinctly cowed , almost stunned , by his companion 's revelations .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 13]: It fell to De Sylva to explain matters to his unexpected guests .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 40]: `` My friend agrees with me that it is only fair that the exact position should be revealed to you , '' he said , addressing Coke , though a dignified gesture invited the others to share his confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 13]: `` It do n't take much tellin ' , '' began Coke .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 9]: De Sylva silenced him with an emphatic hand .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 4]: `` Please attend .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 12]: The situation is not so simple as you seem to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 12]: The loss of your ship can not be dealt with here .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 16]: It raises issues of international law which can only be settled by courts and governments .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 40]: You know , I suppose , that nothing will be done until a complaint is lodged by a British minister , and that hinges upon the very doubtful fact that you will ever again see your own country . ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 11]: The ex-President certainly had the knack of expressing himself clearly .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 8]: Those concluding words rang like a knell .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 33]: They even called Watts back from the slumber of unconsciousness ; the `` chief '' stirred himself where he lay on the floor of the cavern , and began to quaver . ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 35]: -- twelve old salts an ' the skipper 's lass Marooned in the Spanish Main , O. Sing hay -- '' Coke , taken by surprise , was unable to stop this warbling earlier .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 21]: But his hand clutched Watts 's shoulder , and his venomous whisper of `` Shut up , you ijjit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 8]: was so unmistakable that the lyric ceased .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 29]: De Sylva seemed to be aware of some peculiarity in the symptoms of the wounded man 's recovery , but he continued speaking in the same balanced tone .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 15]: `` It happens , by idle chance , that my enemies have become yours .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 12]: The men who destroyed your ship thought they were injuring me .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 17]: I have just pointed out to Capitano De San Benavides the precise outcome of this attack .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 28]: Until a few moments ago we shared the delusion that the troops on Fernando de Noronha believed we were now on our way to a Brazilian port .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 4]: We were mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 29]: More than that , we know now that they have obtained news -- probably through a traitor to our cause -- of the _ Andros-y-Mela 's _ voyage .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 7]: They were prepared for her coming .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 20]: They had made arrangements to receive her -- almost at the place decided on by our friends in Brazil .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 38]: It is more than likely that the _ Andros-y-Mela _ is now lying under the guns of some coast fortress , since the presence of troops and cannon on this side of the island is unprecedented . ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 21]: `` I do n't see wot all this ` as to do with me , '' blurted out Coke determinedly .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 15]: It would not concern you in the least if you were safe at sea .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 14]: But , since you are here , it does concern you most gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 18]: From one point of view , you served my cause well by preparing to lower a boat .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 11]: You misled my persecutors as to locality , at least .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 30]: Of course , I saw you , and thought you were mad , but your action did help to conceal from the soldiers the secret of my true hiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 8]: I wish to be candid with you .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 26]: If my friends and I had realized that you were here by accident , we ought to have taken no steps to save you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 4]: `` Really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 18]: snarled Coke , eying the unruffled Brazilian much as an Andulusian bull might glare at a picador .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 10]: A buzz of angry whispering came from the crew .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 15]: Even Iris flashed a disdainful glance at the man who uttered this atrocious sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 6]: De Sylva raised his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 10]: He permitted himself the luxury of a wintry smile .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 12]: `` Pray , do not misunderstand me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 48]: `` I am humane as most others , but it is difficult to decide whether or not mere humanity , setting aside self-interest , would not rather condemn you to the speedy death of the wreck than drag you to the worse fate that awaits you here .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 25]: And please remember that we did succor you , thus risking observation and a visit by the troops when the sea permits a landing .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 8]: But that is not the true issue .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 21]: An hour ago there were four people on this bare rock -- four of us who looked for escape to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 28]: We were supplied with such small necessaries of existence as would enable us to live if our rescuers were delayed for a day , or even two .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 8]: Now , there will be no rescue .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 52]: We are -- '' he looked slowly around -- `` twenty instead of four ; but we have the same quantity of stores , which consist of a half-emptied skin of wine , a bunch of bananas , a few scraps of maize bread , and some strips of dried meat .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 6]: Do you follow me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 28]: Coke , who had been holding Watts in a sitting posture by a firm grip on his collar , allowed the limp figure to sprawl headlong again .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 36]: He wanted to plunge both hands deeply into his trousers pockets , because men of his type associate attitude so closely with thought that the one is apt to become almost dependent on the other .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 16]: And so , for the moment , the safeguarding of Watts was of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 29]: But Watts had benefited much by the sousing of the spray , while his recovery was expedited by the forcible ejection of the salt water he had swallowed .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 15]: He raised himself on one hand , and looked about with an inquiring eye .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 11]: The Brazilian officer 's uniform seemed to fascinate him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 4]: ` Ello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 3]: he gurgled .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 4]: `` Run in ?
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 12]: Well I 'm -- '' `` Is not that man wounded ?
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 17]: I thought I saw him dashed against the rocks , '' said De Sylva . '' '
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 19]: E ought to be , '' said Coke , `` but ` e 's on ' y drunk .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 23]: A skin o ' rum , ` arf empty , too , just like your skin o ' wine , mister . ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 13]: `` Let him be taken outside and gagged if he resists . ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 9]: There was an uneasy movement among the men .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 7]: Their common impulse was to obey .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 8]: Coke spread his feet a little apart .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 6]: `` Leave ` im alone .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 13]: ` E 'll do no ` arm now , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 23]: `` I can not be interrupted , '' cried De Sylva , whose iron self-restraint seemed to be yielding before British truculence .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 41]: `` I 'll keep ` im quiet but I ca n't ` ave ` im roasted afore ` is time , an ' that 's wot 's ` ul ` appen if you tied him up in that gulley . ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 5]: `` Thanke'ee , skipper .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 11]: You allus were a reel pal , '' murmured Watts .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 5]: Coke bent over him .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 24]: `` If your tongue do n't stop waggin ' it 'll soon be stickin ' out between yer teeth , '' he hissed .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 19]: `` This ai n't no fancy lock-up in the East Injia Dock Road , Arthur , me boy .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 20]: They wo n't bring you a pint of cocoa ` ere , an ' ax if you 're comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 46]: You ` ave n't long to live accordin ' to all accounts , so just close your mouth an ' open your ears , an ' mebbe you 'll know w ` y. '' De Sylva regained his self-possession with a rapidity that was significant .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 34]: He had not climbed to the presidential chair of the Republic from a clerkship in the London Embassy of the Empire without acquiring the habit of estimating his fellow men speedily and accurately .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 17]: Here was one who might be led , but would never permit himself to be driven .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 13]: Moreover , this dethroned ruler was by way of being a philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 13]: `` I hate drunkards , '' he said , shrugging his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 7]: `` You can not trust them .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 18]: If I had been surrounded by trustworthy men , I should not -- '' He broke off .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 12]: There was a sound of hurrying footsteps on the steep pathway .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 18]: A figure , clad in rags that surpassed even De Sylva 's , appeared in the entrance .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 6]: A brief colloquy took place .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 16]: De Sylva 's eager questions were answered in monosyllables , or the nearest approach thereto .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 26]: `` Marcel tells me that one of your boats is drifting away with a man lying in the bottom , '' came the uneasy explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 31]: Coke 's face showed a degree of surprise , which , in his case , was almost invariably akin to disbelief , but an exclamation from Hozier drew all eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 5]: `` Good Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 19]: he cried , `` that must be the lifeboat I was trying to clear when the ship struck .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 18]: Macfarlane was helping me , but he was hit by a bullet and dropped across the thwarts .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 7]: I thought he was dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 17]: `` Dead or alive , he is better off than we , '' said De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 6]: He questioned Marcel again briefly .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 31]: `` There can be no doubt that the man in the boat cast off the lashings when he found that the ship was sinking , '' he continued in English .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 14]: `` Marcel saw him doing that , and wondered why he was alone .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 18]: At any rate , if he is carried beyond the reef , he has a fighting chance .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 5]: We have none . ''
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 23]: Are these men on the island so deaf to human sympathies that they would murder all of us in cold blood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 15]: The girl 's sweet , low-pitched voice sounded inexpressibly sad in that vaulted place .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 12]: Even De Sylva 's studied control gave way before its music .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 20]: He uttered some anguished appeal to the deity in his own tongue , and flung out his hands impulsively .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 9]: `` What would you have me say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 27]: he cried , and his eyes blazed , while the scar on his forehead darkened with the gust of passion that swept over his strong features .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 39]: `` I might lie to you , and try to persuade you that we can exist here without food or water , whereas to-morrow , or next day at the utmost , will see most of us dead .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 23]: But in a few hours you will realize what it means to be kept on this bare rock under a tropical sun .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 6]: You can do one thing .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 6]: Your party greatly outnumbers mine .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 11]: Climb to the top-most pinnacle and signal to the island .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 7]: You will soon be seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 20]: He laughed with a savage irony that was not good to hear , but Coke caught at the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 18]: `` Even that is better 'n tearin ' one another like mad dogs , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 8]: `` I know wot 's comin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 7]: I 've seen it wonst . ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 17]: Hozier made for the exit , where Marcel stood , irresolute , apparently waiting for orders .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 7]: `` Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 4]: demanded De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 11]: `` To see what is becoming of the lifeboat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 4]: `` Better not .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 40]: You can not help your friend , and the instant it becomes known to the troops that there is a living soul on the Grand-p√®re rock they will come in a steam launch and shoot everyone at sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 11]: `` Will that be the answer to our signal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 16]: It was Iris who asked the question , and the Brazilian 's voice softened again .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 16]: `` Why , then , do you advise us to seek our own destruction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 3]: He bowed .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 6]: His manner was almost humble .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 11]: `` It is the easier way , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 7]: `` Is there no other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 24]: `` None -- unless we attack two hundred soldiers with sticks , and stones , and three revolvers , and a sword . ''
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 4]: Hozier came back .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 12]: He had merely stepped a pace or two into the sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 23]: Through the northerly dip of the gulley he had seen the ship 's boat whirled past an islet by the fierce current .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 5]: Macfarlane was not visible .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 6]: Perhaps that was better so .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 29]: At any rate , the sight of the small craft vanishing behind one of the island barriers brought home with telling force the predicament of those who remained .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 29]: Now that the sheer frenzy of the wreck had relaxed , Philip 's head was like to split with the throbbing anguish of the blow he had received .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 6]: But his mind was clearer .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 32]: De Sylva 's words , amplifying his own vague recollection of the scene on board the _ Andromeda _ , enabled him to construct a picture of events as they were .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 31]: And his blood boiled when he thought of Iris , snatched many times from death , only to face it once more in the ravening form of starvation and thirst .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 4]: `` Attack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 4]: he said hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 6]: `` How is that possible ?
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 13]: A deep and wide channel separates us from the main island . ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 21]: The Brazilian , who seemed to have argued himself into a state of stoic despair , gave a startling answer .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 16]: `` We have a boat , a sort of boat , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 8]: `` How many will it hold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 13]: `` Three , in a smooth sea , and with skilled handling .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 21]: It nearly overturned when I and two others crossed from the island , a distance of three hundred yards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 15]: `` But we have ropes , clothes , perhaps some few pieces of wreckage .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 9]: Can nothing be done to repair it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 16]: `` Meaning that we draw lots to see who shall endeavor to escape to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 9]: `` The men might even do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 11]: `` Ah , yes -- the men , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 5]: I think it hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 5]: But , try it !
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 8]: Yes , certainly , try it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 31]: A pause , more eloquent than the most impassioned speech , showed how this frail straw , eddying in the vortex of their fate , might yet be clutched at .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 18]: San Benavides , trying vainly to guess what was being said , blurted forth an anxious inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 5]: His compatriot explained briefly .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 18]: Somehow , the measured cadence of their talk had a less reliable sound than the vigorous Anglo-Saxon .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 6]: They were both brave men .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 17]: They had not scrupled to risk their lives in an enterprise where success beckoned even doubtingly .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 35]: But they were lacking when all that remained to be settled was how best to die ; in such an hour the men of an English speaking race will ever choose a fighting death .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 10]: This time , it was a woman who decided .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 6]: Iris rose to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 25]: She brushed back the strands of damp hair from her face , and with deft hands made a rough-and-ready coil of her abundant tresses .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 23]: `` Are you planning to send me with two others adrift in a boat , while seventeen men are left here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 5]: The Brazilian ceased speaking .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 6]: There was another uneasy pause .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 18]: Hozier felt that the question was addressed to him , but he was tongue-tied , almost shame-faced .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 13]: Coke , however , did not shirk the task of enlightening her .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 9]: `` Something like that , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 16]: `` We ca n't let you cut in with the rest of us , missy .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 6]: That would n't be reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 13]: But it 's best to fix the business fair an ' square .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 39]: We ai n't agoin ' to try any other way , not so long as _ I 'm _ skipper , '' and he looked with brutal frankness at De Sylva and the anxious but uncomprehending San Benavides .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 21]: The ex-President knew what he meant ; even in his despondency he resented the implied slur on his good faith .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 16]: `` You can not examine the boat until darkness sets in , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 15]: `` Then you will find out how frail a foundation you are building on .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 13]: It is absolutely ridiculous to assume that she can be made seaworthy .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 14]: Her occupants would be drowned before they were clear of the islands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 14]: `` In any case , I refuse to go , '' said Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 5]: De Sylva smiled gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 21]: `` You are courageous , senhora , and , in some respects , you are wise , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 51]: `` Yet ... I must admit it ... I would urge you to select the boat -- in preference ... '' Marcel , the Brazilian who had come to tell them of the drifting life-boat , turned away from the mouth of the cavern , and scrambled down the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 8]: `` Wot 's ' e after ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 6]: demanded Coke , suddenly suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 14]: `` He and Domingo are keeping a lookout , '' said De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 15]: `` If the soldiers intend to visit us we should at least be warned .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 23]: The boat is hidden among the rocks on the landward side , '' he added , not without a touch of scorn .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 14]: `` That man has taught us our own duty , '' cried Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 21]: `` The boat that brought these men to this rock can bring nineteen men and a woman to Fernando Noronha .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 6]: We must land there to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 16]: With those to guide us who know the coast , surely that should be possible .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 10]: We have a right to struggle for our lives .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 28]: We , of the _ Andromeda _ , at least , have done no wrong to the cruel wretches who sought to kill us without mercy to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 9]: Why should we not endeavor to defend ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 10]: There is food there , and guns in plenty .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 5]: Let us take them .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 32]: Above all , let us not dream of any such useless device as this proposal to send three to drown somewhere in the sea and leave seventeen to perish miserably here .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 7]: We are in God 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 23]: Let us trust to Him , but while doing that fully and fearlessly , we must seek life , not death . ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 8]: `` Bully for you , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 14]: roared a sailor , and a growl of admiration rang through the cave .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 24]: Instantly a hubbub of talk showed how intent the crew had been on the previous discussion , but Coke shouted them into silence .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 13]: `` Oo axed wot _ you _ think , you swabs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 3]: he bellowed .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 5]: `` Stow your lip !
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 49]: Sink me , if you do n't all do as you 're bid , an ' keep still tongues in your ` eds , I 'll want to know w ` y -- P.D.Q. '' A big , blond Norwegian , Hans Olsen by name , strode forward .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 17]: Unlike the usual self-contained Norseman , he was reputed a `` sea-lawyer '' in the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 16]: `` We haf somedings ter zay for our lifes , yez , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 13]: Coke bent and butted him violently in the stomach with his head .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 16]: The man crashed against the rocky wall , and sat dazed where he had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 11]: `` You 've got to obey orders -- savvy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 3]: growled Coke .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 13]: `` Yez , '' gasped Olsen , evidently fearing a further assault .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 4]: The incident ended .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 27]: Its outstanding feature was the amazing activity displayed by the burly skipper , who had rammed his man before the big fellow could lift a finger .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 19]: It might be expected that Iris would show some sign of dismay , owing to this unlooked-for violence .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 12]: But she was now beyond the reach of merely feminine emotions .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 30]: She had protested against the kicking of Watts because it seemed to lack motive , because Watts was helpless , and because she herself was half-delirious at the time .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 22]: Olsen 's attitude , on the other hand , hinted at mutiny , and mutiny must be repressed at any cost .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 30]: De Sylva 's incisive accents helped to bridge a moment fraught with possibilities , for it would be idle to assume that this polyglot gathering was composed of Bayards .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 12]: Self-preservation is apt to prove stronger than chivalry under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 38]: Let it be assumed that three among the twenty could escape that night , and it was horribly true that the field of selection might be narrowed by a wild-beast struggle long before the sun went down .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 16]: `` The young lady has at least given us a project , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 10]: `` It is a desperate one , Heaven knows !
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 23]: It offers a fantastic chance , and I can see no other , but -- what can we do without arms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 10]: `` Use our heads , '' put in Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 49]: He had not the slightest intention of making a light-hearted joke at that crisis in their affairs , but he happened to look at Coke , and an involuntary smile gleamed through the crust of clotted blood and perspiration that gave his good-looking face a most sinister aspect .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 6]: The Irishman cackled with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 38]: `` Begob , that 's wan for the skipper , '' he crowed ; then some of the others grinned , and the _ Andromeda 's _ little company stood four-square again to the winds of adversity .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 26]: Having blundered into prominence , the second mate was quick to see that he must hammer home the facts , though in more serious vein .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 25]: `` Bring us to the island , Senhor De Sylva , '' he said , `` and we will make a fight of it .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 17]: In any case , even if we fail , they will not deliberately kill a woman .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 18]: There must be other women there who will intervene in behalf of one of their own sex .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 5]: But we may succeed .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 16]: It is improbable that the whole of the troops will be gathered in one spot .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 15]: Why should we not take some small detachment by surprise and secure their weapons ?
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 20]: If we can land unobserved , we ought to be able to drop on them apparently from the skies .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 34]: I take it that the presence here of Captain San Benavides is unknown , and the leadership of an officer in the enemy 's own uniform should turn the scale in our favor .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 10]: Have you no followers among the troops or islanders ?
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 27]: Suppose we make good our first attack , and seize a strong position -- is n't it probable we may receive assistance from your partisans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 15]: `` Perhaps -- among the convicts , '' was De Sylva 's grim reply .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 8]: `` No officials , or soldiers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 4]: `` Not one .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 16]: They are chosen for this service on account of their animosity against the former Government .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 21]: How else could you account for their treatment of unarmed men on a ship crippled by their first shell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 8]: `` You spoke of a steam launch .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 6]: Where is that kept ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 18]: `` At a wharf under the walls of the citadel which commands the town and anchorage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 40]: `` Assuming we have a stroke of luck and rush some outpost , would it be possible to cross the island before dawn and board the launch or some other craft in which we can put to sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 13]: `` There is only the launch , and some small fishing catamarans .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 20]: No other boats are allowed to exist on the island , in order to prevent the escape of convicts .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 29]: The boat we possess is really a badly-constructed catamaran , without a sail , and minus the out-rigger which alone renders it safe for the shortest voyage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 12]: `` Wy did n't you say that sooner , mister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 4]: put in Coke .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 34]: `` If some of these jokers knew wot sort of craft it was , mebbe it would n't ` ave needed a shove in the stommick to bring Hans Olsen to heel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 10]: `` I am sorry , '' said De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 18]: `` You see , I realized the utter folly of trying to escape in that fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 11]: The two men looked each other squarely in the eye .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 21]: The ex-President of a great republic and the master of a worn-out tramp steamer were both born leaders of men .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 16]: Whatsoever prospect of a cabal existed previously , it was scotched now , beyond doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 23]: Henceforth , no matter what ills threatened , surely the little army mustered on the Grand-p√®re rock would stand or fall together !
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 10]: An unerring token of unity was forthcoming at once .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 15]: `` Please , miss , an ' gents all , may we smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 4]: pleaded a voice .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 14]: Iris was for an immediate permission , but De Sylva shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 11]: `` Not until the tide falls , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 14]: `` There is a very real fear of a visit from the launch .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 23]: It has passed this spot four times during the past two days -- ever since my absence was discovered , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 28]: The soldiers have searched every outlying island , but they have avoided Grand-p√®re because it is believed that a landing is highly dangerous if not quite impracticable .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 24]: My friend Marcel , a fisherman , discovered by accident the only safe means of reaching the path which winds round the island .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 22]: Happily , the wretch who betrayed the mission of the _ Andros-y-Mela _ did not know the secret of my refuge .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 32]: And I see now that the Governor must be convinced that I am still hiding among the cliffs , or your vessel would not have appeared off South Point this morning .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 10]: No , there must be no smoking as yet .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 18]: In this clear air the slightest cloud might be seen rising above the rocks from without . ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 6]: Marcel reappeared at the entrance .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 21]: With him was another man , whom Hozier remembered seeing when he was hauled up from the ship with Iris .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 14]: `` Ah , I was not mistaken , '' went on De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 8]: `` Here comes news of the launch !
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 10]: They have signaled for it across the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 21]: Marcel entered the cave with an expressive gesture , for long habit had almost robbed him of his native vivacity .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 31]: His companion , Domingo , climbed the opposite wall of the ravine and stretched himself at full length in a niche where there was room for a man to lie .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 21]: Some tufts of rough grass grew there in sufficient density to conceal his head while he peered between the stalks .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 14]: They could see him quite plainly , but no one wanted to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 40]: Though the unceasing wash of a heavy swell against the rocks would have drowned the noise had they shouted in unison , there was no need to tell anyone present that a very real and dangerous crisis had arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 20]: The slow change in the direction of Domingo 's gaze showed the approach and passing of the hostile vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 25]: It was evident that a long halt was made in the channel close to the wreck , of which some fragments remained above water .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 50]: Still , curiously enough , it was impossible for those on board the launch to read the ship 's name , since the word '' _ Andromeda _ , '' twice embossed on the sharp cut-water , was hidden by the jutting rocks on both sides of the cleft .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 46]: But it was not the fear of instant death following on the discovery that the Grand-p√®re islet was inhabited that kept tongues mute and ears on the alert during a quarter of an hour that seemed to be protracted to a quarter of a day .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 27]: At present they were shut off from hostile bullets by the walls of a fortress stronger than any that could be built by men 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 13]: The greater danger was that the enemy 's suspicions might be aroused .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 55]: Let those who held Fernando Noronha with the armed forces of Brazil once come to regard the isolated rock in mid channel as providing even a possible refuge for the ex-President and his friends , and it would mean the complete overthrow of the slender chance of saving their lives that still offered itself .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 42]: So they waited in silence , watching the rigid figure of the prostrate Brazilian , just as those among them who were saved from the _ Andromeda _ had watched the arch of spray and spindrift from the slowly sinking forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 16]: At last Domingo turned his head slightly , and gave them a reassuring little nod .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 9]: He said something , which De Sylva translated .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 33]: `` They have a photograph of the wreck , '' he said , `` and are now steaming through the northerly channel to the anchorage on the west side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 16]: Most fortunately , they do not seem to be aware of your drifting boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 34]: Then he added , with a courtliness that was so incongruous with his unkempt appearance and patched and tattered garments ; -- `` If the Senhora permits , the men may smoke now .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 10]: In another hour the channel will not be navigable .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 22]: We have a hot and tiring day before us , and I advise sleep for those to whom it is vouchsafed .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 17]: If the weather continues to improve , the next tide will bring us a smooth sea .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 15]: Given that , and a dark night -- well -- we may make history .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 4]: Who knows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 34]: CHAPTER VII CROSS PURPOSES Though Iris gave such warlike counsel , it would be doing her a grave injustice to assume that her gentle disposition was changed because of the day 's sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 19]: The erstwhile light-hearted schoolgirl and youthful mistress of her uncle 's house had been subjected to dynamic influences .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 24]: The ordeal through which she had passed , unscathed bodily but seared in spirit , had left her strung to a tense pitch .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 8]: Relaxation had not come -- as yet .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 15]: She only knew that she resented to the uttermost the Brazilians ' malevolent fury .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 10]: Hers was a nature that could not endure unfairness .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 53]: It was unfair of David Verity to seek to mend his shattered fortunes by forcing her into a hateful marriage ; unfair of both Verity and Coke to found their new venture on a great fraud ; and monstrously unfair of these island factionaries to vent their spite on an innocent ship .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 10]: So , for the hour , she was inspired .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 36]: It is the high-souled enthusiast who devotes life itself to a cause ; those who practice oppression have ever most to beware of in the man or woman whose conscience will not condone a wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 19]: Of course , in this present clash of emotions , Iris little understood what her advice really meant .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 13]: She was appealing to heaven rather than to the force of arms .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 31]: To one of her temperament , it seemed incredible that a number of inoffensive strangers should be slaughtered because a South American republic could not agree in choosing a president .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 26]: Such a thing was unheard of in her previous experience , built on no more solid foundation than the humdrum existence of Brussels and Bootle .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 19]: And the inhabitants of neither Brussels nor Bootle settle their political differences by shooting casual visitors at sight .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 17]: Oddly enough , the only professional soldier present condemned her project roundly when it was mooted .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 22]: `` In leaving the island to-night you are acting on an assumption , '' protested Captain San Benavides to his chief .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 15]: `` You can not be sure that the _ Andros-y-Mela _ will not appear .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 47]: The arrangement is that she is to send a boat here soon after midnight , yet , if this mad scheme of an attack on armed troops by unarmed men is persisted in , we must begin to ferry to the island long before that hour .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 11]: In all probability , we shall be discovered at once .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 24]: At the very moment that our friends are eagerly awaiting us on board the ship we may be lying dead on the island .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 5]: The notion is preposterous .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 18]: Be guided by me , Dom Corria , and decline to have anything to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 33]: Better still , let these English boors promise to forget that we are alive ; then Marcel can guide them to the landing-place , where they will be shot speedily and comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 9]: There is no sense in sacrificing the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 10]: She must be kept here on some pretext . ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 8]: The ex-President took thought before he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 20]: He did not deny himself that the confident air of these hard-bitten sailors made strong appeal to his judgment .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 32]: He had his own reasons for distrusting some among his professed supporters , and he did not share his military aide 's opinion as to the coming of the promised vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 33]: `` There is a good deal in what you say , senhor adjudante , '' he announced after his bright eyes had dwelt on San Benavides ' expressive face in thoughtful scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 33]: `` In England they have a proverb that a man can not both run with the hare and hunt with the hounds , but such maxims are not framed for would-be Presidents .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 18]: I fear we must fall in with our allies ' views , _ faute de mieux _ .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 10]: You and I have to lead a headstrong army .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 25]: That little Hercules of a commander is stubborn as a mule -- a mule that has the strength and courage of a wild boar .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 11]: The younger man thinks only of the girl 's safety .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 12]: He , at least , will not consent to leave her .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 20]: Both , backed by their crew , will not scruple to sacrifice us if their interests point that way .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 16]: Trust me to twist them into the course that shall best serve our own needs .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 15]: I am now going to tell them that you approve of their plan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 15]: Forthwith he launched out into an English version of the excellent captain 's comments .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 8]: His precise , well-turned periods were admirable .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 14]: Their marked defect was that he said the exact contrary to San Benavides .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 17]: Iris , having a born aptitude for languages , spoke French and German with some proficiency .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 34]: She had also devoted many hours to the study of Spanish during the past winter , and it happens that the Portuguese of Brazil is less unlike Spanish than the Portuguese of Lisbon .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 39]: In Europe , national antipathies serve to accentuate existing differences between the two tongues , but the peoples of the South American seaboard feel the need of a common speech , and local conditions have standardized many words .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 31]: Hence , the Spanish language will serve all ordinary purposes among the Latin races who have made their own the vast continent that stretches from Panama to Tierra del Fuego .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 20]: So the girl 's super-active brain was puzzled by De Sylva 's rendering of his military friend 's remarks .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 30]: With the vaguest knowledge of what was actually said , she suspected that San Benavides had opposed the very project which , according to the President , he favored .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 54]: She had caught the name of the relief vessel , the words _ bote _ , `` boat , '' _ las doce _ , `` twelve o'clock , '' _ √† bordo de buque _ , `` on board the ship , '' and others which did not figure in the translation .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 4]: She wondered why .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 6]: The long day wore slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 5]: The heat was intense .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 22]: Even the hardened sailors soon found that if the atmosphere of the cavern were to remain endurable they might not smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 13]: So pipes were extinguished , and they tried to better their condition .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 15]: Water-soaked coats and boots placed in the sun were dry in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 14]: Iris was persuaded to allow her dress to be treated in this manner .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 41]: She was still wearing the heavy ulster of the early morning -- when the aftermath of the gale was chill and searching -- and the possession of this outer wrap made easy the temporary discarding of a skirt and blouse .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 15]: Unhappily , she answered in French some simple query of the dapper officer 's .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 20]: Thenceforth , to her great bewilderment and Hozier 's manifest annoyance , he pestered her with compliments and inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 11]: To avoid both , she expressed a longing for sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 44]: It seemed to her excited imagination that she would never be able to sleep again , yet her limbs were scarcely composed in comfort on a litter of coarse grass and parched seaweed than her eyes closed in the drowsiness of sheer exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 6]: This respite was altogether helpful .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 22]: She had slept but little during the gale , and its tremendous climax had surprised her vitality at a low ebb .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 18]: When she awoke , the ravine was in shadow and the interior of the cave was dark .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 11]: Her first conscious sensation was that of almost intolerable thirst .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 45]: Her lips were blistered , her tongue and palate sore , and she asked herself in alarm what new evil was afflicting her , until she remembered the drenching she had received and the amount of salt-laden air that had passed into her lungs .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 15]: Nevertheless , she cried involuntarily for water , and again she was offered wine .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 15]: She managed to smile in a strained fashion at this malicious humor of fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 27]: By a freak of memory she called to mind the somewhat similar predicament of the crew of a storm-tossed ship that she had once read about .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 17]: They ran short of water , but the vessel carried hundreds of cases of bottled stout .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 49]: During three long weeks of boating against the wind those wretched men were compelled to drink stout morning , noon , and night , and never did temperance argument apply with greater force to the seafaring community than toward the end of that enforced regimen of malt liquor .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 22]: Hozier , who had aroused her by touching her shoulder , fancied he saw the gleam of merriment in her face .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 7]: `` What is amusing you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 10]: She told him , though she spoke with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 14]: `` It is not quite so bad as that , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 20]: `` If there is no hitch in our plans , we should be on the island within five hours .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 16]: We have everything thought out as far as may be in view of the unknown .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 27]: At any rate , Miss Yorke , if we succeed in getting you safely ashore , you personally will have but slight cause for further anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 28]: The proposal is that Marcel shall take you at once to the hut of an old convict whom he can trust -- '' `` A convict ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 11]: The word was ominous , and she was hardly awake .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 19]: `` The population of Fernando Noronha is almost entirely made of convicts and soldiers , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 11]: `` But am I to be left there alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 9]: `` What else is there to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 22]: You can not join in the attack on a fort -- and that offers our only chance , it would seem .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 10]: Granted an effective surprise , we may carry it .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 10]: Then your guardian will bring you to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 7]: `` What if you fail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 11]: `` We must not fail , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 14]: `` Please do not hide the alternative from me , '' she pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 47]: `` I have endured so much -- '' `` Well , do n't you see , this man -- who , by the way , is married , and has a daughter aged fourteen -- will , if necessary , reveal your presence to the Governor .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 53]: By that time , say , in a day or two , the excitement will have died down , the news of your escape will be cabled to England , you will be sent to the coast on the Government steamer , and you can travel home by the next mail . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 23]: `` That sounds very simple -- and European , '' she said , and the pathetic sarcasm was not lost on him .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 6]: `` It is reasonable enough .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 20]: Unfortunately for us , all the bother centers round Senhor De Sylva , to whom we owe our lives .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 28]: He is outside at the moment , showing our skipper the lay of the land before the light fails , so I am free to speak plainly .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 16]: When he is dead there will be no further trouble , till the next revolution .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 11]: But why endeavor to look ahead when seeing is impossible ?
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 16]: At present , what really presses is the necessity that you should eat and drink .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 11]: We have shared out the whole of the available food .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 5]: Here is your portion .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 12]: We deemed it best to give the men one square meal .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 12]: They know now that they must earn the next one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 9]: With each instant her perceptive powers were quickening .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 12]: She was aware that he had deliberately avoided the main issue .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 26]: De Sylva 's probable death implied a good deal , but it was the supreme test of her courage that she refrained from useless questioning .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 20]: Yet she thrust aside the two bananas and supply of dried meat and crusts that Hozier placed before her .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 16]: `` I can not eat , '' she murmured , striving to control her voice .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 5]: `` But you must .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 4]: It is imperative .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 19]: You would not wish to break down at the very moment your best energies will be in demand .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 15]: Our lives , as well as your own , may depend on your strength .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 14]: Come , Miss Yorke , no woman could have been pluckier than you .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 7]: Do n't fail us now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 6]: The gloom was deepening momentarily .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 60]: Hozier 's back was turned to the entrance , and , in the ever-growing darkness , she was unable to see his face ; but his anxious protest in no wise deceived her ; she even smiled again at the ruse that attempted to saddle her with some measure of responsibility for the success or failure of the raid .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 19]: `` If I promise to eat -- and drink this sour wine -- will you be candid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 9]: `` Well -- '' `` One must bargain .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 9]: There is no other way ... Promise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 25]: `` I suppose you mean that I must agree to please you by wild guessing about events that may turn out quite differently . ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 7]: `` Candid , I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 8]: `` Yes -- that most certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 14]: `` In the first place , may we go into the fresh air ?
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 7]: I must have slept many hours .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 6]: What time is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 6]: `` About seven o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 3]: `` Seven !
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 14]: Have I been lying here since goodness knows what time this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 48]: `` You were thoroughly used up , '' he said , and he added , with a laugh : `` If it is any consolation , I may tell you that , to the best of my belief , you never moved nor uttered a sound . ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 28]: `` For instance , I did n't snore , '' she cried , rising to her feet , and thanking the kindly night that veiled her untidiness .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 10]: `` I -- do n't -- think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 10]: `` Oh , please be more positive than that .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 10]: You send a cold shiver down my back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 21]: `` Several members of the _ Andromeda 's _ crew also indulged in a prolonged siesta , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 21]: `` I assure you it was almost out of the question to divide the sleepers into snorers and non-snorers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 25]: A man will talk harmless nonsense of that sort when he is at his wit 's end to wriggle out of a perplexing situation .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 19]: Hozier was deputed to obtain the girl 's consent to the proposal he had already put before her .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 19]: He feared that she would refuse compliance , for he understood her fine temper better than the others .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 55]: He was a young man -- one but little versed in the ways of women -- yet some instinct warned him that there was a nobility in Iris Yorke 's nature that might set self at naught and urge her to share her companions ' lot , even though certain death were the outcome .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 7]: They passed together through the cavern .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 9]: Watts , sound asleep , was lying there .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 18]: The majority of the men were seated on the rocks without , or lounging near the entrance .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 21]: They were smoking now freely , the only stipulation being that matches were not to be struck in the open .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 10]: Their whispered talk ceased when they saw the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 30]: Absorbed in the prospect of a fight for life , for the moment they had forgotten her , but a murmured tribute of sympathy and recognition greeted her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 7]: The Irishman found his tongue first .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 45]: `` Begorrah , miss , '' he said , `` but it 's the proud man I 'll be the next time I see you smilin ' from the kay side at Liverpool , no matter whether I 'm there meself or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 14]: No one laughed at the absurd phrase which so clearly expressed its meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 45]: But the ship 's cook , Peter , noting the strips of dried meat in her hands , raised a grin by saying : `` Sorry the galley fire is out , miss , or I 'd ` ave stewed 'em a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 18]: This kindly badinage was gratifying , though it helped to reveal the interrupted topic of their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 12]: There was no hiding the desperate character of the coming adventure .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 13]: The _ Andromeda 's _ crew did not attempt to minimize it .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 12]: The choice offered lay only in the manner of their death .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 15]: As to the prospect of ultimate escape , they hardly gave it a thought .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 83]: Some among them had served in the armies of Europe , and they , at least , were under no delusion concerning the issue of an attack on a fort by less than a score of unarmed men -- seventeen to be exact , since two of the ship 's company were so maimed by the bursting of the shell on the forecastle as to be practically helpless ; it was by the rarest good fortune that they were able to walk .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 9]: Iris smiled at them in her frank way .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 21]: `` I hope you will all be spared to ship on a new _ Andromeda _ , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 42]: No sooner had the words left her lips than the thought came unbidden : `` If my uncle and Captain Coke wished the ship to be thrown away , nothing could have better suited their purposes than this tragic error . ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 24]: For the instant , the unforeseen outcome of that Sunday afternoon 's plotting in the peaceful garden of Linden House held her imagination .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 36]: She recalled each syllable of it , and there throbbed in her brain the hitherto undreamed of possibility that Coke had brought the _ Andromeda _ to Fernando Noronha in pursuance of his thievish project .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 17]: At once she whispered to Hozier : `` Is there anyone on the path below ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 7]: `` No , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 14]: `` The Brazilians are with Coke at the top of the gully . ''
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 13]: `` Is it safe for us to go the other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 5]: `` I think so .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 10]: But you must be careful not to slip . ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 16]: She caught his arm , little knowing the thrill her clasp sent through his frame .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 9]: This simple gesture of her confidence was bitter-sweet .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 16]: He resolutely closed his eyes to the knowledge that this might be their last talk .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 10]: `` I shall not fall , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 7]: `` I am a good mountaineer .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 9]: I learnt the trick of it in Cumberland .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 4]: Come with me .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 11]: There is a pleasant breeze blowing from the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 4]: They climbed down .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 15]: Neither spoke until they stood on the curving ledge that had proved their salvation .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 13]: Though the tide was rising again , the heavy sea was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 24]: The current still created some spume and noise as it swept past the reef , but its anger had vanished with the gale .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 24]: Beyond the fringe of broken water a slight swell only served to mirror in countless facets the tender light of a perfect sunset .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 10]: The eastern horizon was a broad line of silver .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 15]: Nearer , the shadow of the island created bands of purest green and ultramarine .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 13]: They reached the place from which the Brazilians had thrown the rope .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 13]: They could hear the quiet plash of the water in the cleft .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 17]: Piled against a low-lying rock were the funnel and other debris of the _ Andromeda _ .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 10]: The black hull was plainly visible beneath the surface .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 41]: Even while they were looking at the wreck a huge fish curled his ten feet of length with stealthy grace from out some dim recess ; it might be , perhaps , from out the crushed shell of the chart-room .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 6]: Hozier glanced at his companion .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 30]: He half expected her to shrink back appalled at this sinister sight ; it was her destiny to surprise him not once but many times during that amazing period .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 7]: `` Is that a shark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 4]: she asked quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 12]: `` Yes ... You stipulated for candor , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 16]: `` I had no notion that such a monster could move with so great elegance .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 25]: I think I would rather be eaten by a shark than lie at the bottom of the sea like our poor vessel there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 13]: `` Even a shark would appreciate the compliment , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 16]: Her eyes continued to watch the terrifying apparition until it prowled into hidden depths again .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 14]: `` I am not sorry I have seen it , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 7]: `` It helps one to understand .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 29]: We are glib concerning the laws of nature , and seem to regard them much as the printed regulations stuck on hackney carriages , whatsoever they may be .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 8]: Yet , how cruelly just they are !
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 27]: I suppose that the finding of the ship 's booty by that huge creature has given a new span of life to some weaker fish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 16]: Hozier did not know whether or not she had realized the shark 's real quest .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 6]: Her next words enlightened him .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 19]: `` If we follow the others , will the soldiers throw our dead bodies into the sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 40]: `` I want you to believe that you will be absolutely safe if we escape being discovered during the crossing of the narrow strip of water that separates this rock from the island , '' he hastened to say .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 14]: `` That is your only risk , and it is a light one .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 16]: Senhor De Sylva is sure that the troops will not keep the keenest lookout to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 11]: They are still convinced that the insurgent steamer is sunk .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 10]: Our chief danger will date from to-morrow 's dawn .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 13]: Marcel reports that a systematic search of the island was begun to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 24]: It will be continued to-morrow , but on new lines , because , by that time , they will have learnt the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 43]: The _ Andros-y-Mela _ is not lying in pieces at the foot of this rock , the President has not escaped , and every practicable inch of Fernando Noronha and the adjacent islands will be scoured in the hope of finding him .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 25]: At first sight , that looks like being in our favor ; in reality , it means the end if we are discovered here .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 9]: The soldiers will shoot first and inquire afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 34]: I have not the slightest doubt but that plenty of evidence will be forthcoming that we were a set of desperadoes who had unlawfully interfered in the affairs of a foreign state . ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 18]: She appeared to be weighing this argument , sitting in judgment on De Sylva and his theories .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 20]: `` I want to do that which is for the good of all , '' she said at length .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 17]: `` Do you ask me to go to this convict 's house , Mr. Hozier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 11]: `` I urge it on you with the utmost conviction .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 11]: With you off our hands , we can act freely .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 7]: We must deliver an attack to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 22]: God in Heaven , you can not think that we would expose you to the perils of a desperate fight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 10]: His sudden outburst was unexpected , even by himself .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 8]: He trembled in an agony of passion .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 9]: Iris placed a timid hand on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 9]: `` I will go , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 10]: `` Please do not be distressed on my account .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 4]: I will go .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 15]: I brought you here , not to discuss my own fate , but yours .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 22]: These Brazilians will not scruple to make use of you , and then throw you aside if it suits their purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 34]: That man , De Sylva , does not care how he attains power , and I know that he and the officer entertain some plan which they have not revealed to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 8]: `` You ... _ know _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 8]: I understand a little of their language .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 18]: I have a mere glimpse of its sense , as one sees a landscape through a mist .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 20]: When De Sylva told you to-day that San Benavides was with you heart and soul , he was lying .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 15]: There were things said about a ship , and midnight , and a boat .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 7]: I watched the officer 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 9]: He was wholly opposed to the landing to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 8]: My mind is not so vague now .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 8]: I think I can grasp his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 14]: Was it not to-night that the _ Andros-y-Mela _ was to appear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 17]: `` Well , may they not hope secretly that she will keep to the fixed hour ?
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 25]: Once you and I and the others are on the island , and an alarm is given , the Brazilians could slip away unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 6]: Yes , that is it .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 13]: I do not trust them any more than I trusted Captain Coke .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 22]: Do n't you realize that he brought the _ Andromeda _ to this place in order to wreck her more easily ?
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 22]: It was to supply a pretext for the visit that he made undrinkable the water in the ship 's tanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 10]: That appealing hand still rested on Philip 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 6]: Its touch affected him profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 37]: With a lightning dart of memory his thoughts went back to the moment when she lay , inert and half-fainting , in his arms on the bridge , after he had taken her from the lazarette .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 30]: But he controlled his voice sufficiently to say : `` You may be right ; indeed , I know you are right , so far as Coke is concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 29]: When I went aft to find out if one of the boats could not be cleared , I noticed that a steering-gear box had been prised open again .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 24]: I had time for only a second 's glance , but I was sure the damage had not been done by a bullet .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 16]: So the _ Andromeda _ was doomed to be lost , no matter what happened .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 19]: By -- , forgive me , Miss Yorke , but this kind of thing makes one savage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 7]: `` Perhaps it is matterless now .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 18]: Coke will stand by the rest of us in our struggle for life , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 12]: But the Brazilians -- '' `` Have no fear of them .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 9]: I , too , have watched San Benavides .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 43]: I do n't like the fellow , and would n't place an ounce of faith in him , but De Sylva has brains , and he knows well enough that no ship from Brazil will come to Fernando Noronha in his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 38]: In fact , he dreads a visit by a Government vessel , in which event our frail chance of seizing that launch -- '' She felt , rather than saw , that he had suddenly grown rigid .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 11]: His right arm flew out and drew her to him .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 4]: `` Sh-s-s-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 10]: he breathed , and pulled her behind a rock .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 11]: Her woman 's heart yielded to dread of the unseen .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 11]: It pulsed violently , and she was tempted to scream .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 27]: Despite his warning , she must at least have whispered a question , but her ears caught a sound to which they were now well accustomed .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 20]: The light chug-chug of an engine and the flapping of a propeller came up to them from the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 6]: The steam launch was approaching .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 7]: Perhaps they had been seen already !
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 15]: As if to emphasize this new peril , there was an interval of silence .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 6]: Steam had been shut off .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 11]: Philip touched the girl 's lips lightly with a finger .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 13]: Then he lay flat on the ledge and began to creep forward .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 41]: It was impossible that he should run and warn the others , but it was essential , above all else , that he should ascertain what the men on the launch were doing , and the extent of their knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 41]: He found a tuft of the grass that clung to a crevice where its roots drew hardy sustenance from the crumbling rock ; he ventured to thrust his head through this screen , following Domingo 's example some hours earlier .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 12]: Almost directly beneath , his eager glance found the little vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 8]: She was floating past with the current .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 16]: He peered down on to her deck as if from the top of a mast .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 10]: A few cigarette-smoking officers were grouped in her bows .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 21]: Apparently , they were more interested in the remains of the _ Andromeda _ than in the natural fortress overhead .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 12]: Clustered round the hatch were some twenty soldiers , also smoking .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 15]: One of the officers pointed to the ledge ; he was excited and emphatic .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 24]: Philip could not imagine that they had detected him , but he feared lest Iris , in her agitation , might have moved .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 28]: In that clear , calm air , not even the growing dusk would hide the flutter of a skirt or the altered position of a white face .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 15]: A man in charge of the wheel replied to the officer with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 28]: The first speaker turned , glanced at the Brothers reef , behind which the _ Andromeda 's _ boat had vanished that morning , and nodded dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 15]: The man at the wheel growled an order , and the engine started again .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 19]: Though Hozier knew not what was said , the significance of this pantomime was not lost on him .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 42]: The local pilot was afraid of these treacherous waters in the dark , but next day Frade de Francez -LRB- which is the islanders ' name for the Grand-p√®re Rock -RRB- would surely be explored if a landing could be made .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 27]: At a guess , the silent watcher took it that the steersman had declined to make a circuit of the rock until the light was good .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 24]: Away bustled the launch , but Hozier did not move until there was no risk of his figure being silhouetted against the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 12]: Even then , he wormed his way backward with slow caution .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 13]: Iris was crouched where he had left her , wide-eyed , motionless .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 11]: `` Good job we came here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 23]: `` It is evident they mean to maintain a patrol until there is news of De Sylva one way or the other .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 14]: It will be interesting now to hear what the gallant San Benavides says .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 26]: If any ship comes to Fernando Noronha to-night she will be seen from the island long before any signal is visible at this point . ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 11]: `` Do you think the others saw the launch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 22]: `` No -- not unless some of the men strayed down the gully , which they were told not to do .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 13]: The breakers would drown the noise of the engines and screw . ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 6]: There was a slight pause .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 7]: `` Will you tell them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 4]: she went on .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 10]: This time the pause was more eloquent than words .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 10]: Quite unconsciously , Iris replied to her own question .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 34]: `` Of course , as you said a little while ago , we owe our lives to Dom Corria De Sylva , '' she murmured , as if she were reasoning with herself .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 22]: By chance , probably because Hozier stooped to help her to her feet , his arm rested lightly across her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 13]: `` I will not pretend to misunderstand you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 27]: `` If the Brazilians do not mean to play the game , it would be a just punishment to let them rush on their own doom .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 32]: But De Sylva may not agree with this fop of an officer , and , in any event , we must go straight with him until he shows his teeth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 14]: `` You seem to dislike Captain San Benavides , '' she said inconsequently .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 13]: `` I regard him as a brainless ass , '' he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 19]: `` Somehow , that sounds like a description of a dead donkey , which one never sees . ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 4]: `` Mademoiselle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 10]: came a voice from the lip of the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 22]: `` One can hear him , though , '' laughed Hozier , with a warning pressure that suspiciously resembled a hug .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 23]: These two were children , in some respects , quicker to jest than to grieve , better fitted for mirth than tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 15]: They moved out from their niche , and San Benavides blustered into vehement French .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 18]: `` We are going to the landing-place before it is too dark , '' he muttered angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 19]: `` We must not show a light ; in a few minutes the path will be most dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 6]: Please make haste , mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 10]: We did not know where you had gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 14]: `` The men knew , '' suggested Hozier in the girl 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 11]: He dared not trust either his temper or his vocabulary .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 18]: `` We shall lose no time , now , monsieur , '' said Iris , hurrying on .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 5]: `` This way then .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 9]: No , we do not pass the cave .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 7]: We go right round the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 5]: Permit me , mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 8]: I am acquainted with each step . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 5]: He took her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 3]: Philip followed .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 23]: He was young enough to long for an opportunity to tell San Benavides that he was a puppy , a mongrel puppy .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 25]: Just then he would have given a gun-metal case , filled with cigars -- the only treasure he possessed -- for a Portuguese dictionary .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 19]: After a really difficult and hazardous descent , they found the others awaiting them in a rock-shrouded cove .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 13]: The barest standing-room was afforded by a patch of shingle and detritus .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 13]: Alongside a flat stone lay three broad planks tied together with cowhide .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 10]: The center plank was turned up at one end .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 16]: This was the catamaran , which de Sylva had dignified by the name of boat .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 26]: The primitive craft rested in a black pool in which the stars trembled , though they were hardly visible as yet in the brighter sky .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 35]: The water murmured in response to the movement of the tide , but to the unaided eye there was no vestige of a passage through the volcanic barrier that reared itself on every hand .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 8]: `` Were ` ave you bin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 3]: growled Coke .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 9]: `` We 've lost a good ten minnits .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 18]: You ought to ` ave known , Hozier , that it 's darkest just after sunset . ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 11]: `` We could not have started sooner , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 6]: `` W ' y not ?
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 15]: We were kep ' waitin ' up there , searchin ' for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 10]: `` That was our best slice of luck to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 18]: Had any of you appeared on the ledge you would have been seen from the launch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 5]: `` Wot launch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 9]: `` The launch that visited us this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 15]: Ten minutes ago she was standing by at the foot of the rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: Philip spoke slowly and clearly .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 8]: He meant his news to strike home .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 9]: As he anticipated , De Sylva broke in .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 8]: `` You _ saw _ it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 11]: he asked , and his deep voice vibrated with dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 23]: I even made out , by actions rather than words , that the darkness alone prevented the soldiers from coming here to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 8]: The skipper would not risk it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 8]: De Sylva said something under his breath .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 21]: He spoke rapidly to San Benavides , and the latter seemed to be cowed , for his reply was brief .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 7]: Then the ex-President reverted to English .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 16]: `` I have decided to send Marcel and Domingo ashore first , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 11]: `` They will select the safest place for a landing .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 17]: Marcel will bring back the catamaran , and take off Mr. Hozier and the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 19]: Captain Coke and I will follow , and the others in such order as Senhor Benavides thinks fit .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 19]: The catamaran will only hold three with safety , but Marcel believes he can find another for Domingo .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 10]: Remember , all of you , silence is essential .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 19]: If there is an accident , some of us may be called on to drown without a cry .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 16]: We must be ready to do it for the sake of those who are left .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 6]: Are we all agreed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 7]: A hum of voices answered him .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 11]: De Sylva was , at least , a born leader .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 39]: CHAPTER VIII THE RIGOR OF THE GAME In obedience to their leader 's order , Marcel , the taciturn , and Domingo , from whose lips the Britons had scarce heard a syllable , squatted on the catamaran .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 23]: Marcel wielded a short paddle , and an almost imperceptible dip of its broad blade sent the strangely-built craft across the pool .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 9]: Once in the shadow , it disappeared completely .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 6]: There was no visible outlet .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 15]: The rocks thrust their stark ridge against the sky in a seemingly impassable barrier .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 38]: Some of the men stared at the jagged crests as though they half expected to see the Brazilians making a portage , just as travelers in the Canadian northwest haul canoes up a river obstructed by rapids .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 26]: `` Well , that gives me the go-by , '' growled Coke , whose alert ear caught no sound save the rippling of the water .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 13]: `` I say , mister , ` ow is it done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 4]: he went on .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 17]: `` It is a simple thing when you know the secret , '' said De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 11]: `` Have you passed Fernando Noronha before , Captain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 6]: `` Many a time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 19]: `` Have you seen the curious natural canal which you sailors call the Hole in the Wall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 15]: `` Yes , it 's near the s ` uth ` ard end . ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 17]: `` Well , the sea has worn away a layer of soft rock that existed there .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 19]: In the course of centuries a channel has been cut right across the two hundred yards of land .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 38]: Owing to the same cause the summer rains have excavated a ravine through the crater up above , and a similar passage exists here , only it happens to run parallel to the line of the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 18]: It extends a good deal beyond its apparent outlet , and is defended by a dangerous reef .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 17]: Marcel once landed on a rock during a very calm day , and saw the opening .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 19]: He investigated it , luckily for me -- luckily , in fact , for all of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 19]: Watts interrupted De Sylva 's smooth periods by a startled ejaculation , and Coke turned on him fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 7]: `` Wot 's up now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 8]: `` Ai n't you sober yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 12]: `` Some dam thing jumped on me , '' explained Watts .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 10]: `` Probably a crab , '' said De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 9]: `` There are jumping crabs all around here .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 6]: It will not hurt you .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 8]: It is quite a small creature . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 25]: `` Oh , if it 's on ' y a crab , '' muttered Watts , `` sorry I gev ' tongue , skipper .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 16]: I thought it was a rat , an ' I ca n't abide 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 23]: `` Then you must learn to endure them while you are in Fernando do Noronha itself , '' went on the Brazilian .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 18]: `` The island absolutely swarms with rats ; some of the larger varieties are rather dangerous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 6]: `` Sufferin ' Moses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 3]: groaned Watts .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 11]: `` It 'll be the death o ' me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 7]: `` Wot color are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 3]: asked Coke .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 12]: De Sylva 's reply was given in a tone of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 16]: Certainly these hardy mariners had selected an unusual topic for discussion at a critical moment .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 10]: `` The common dark gray , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 12]: `` That 's all right , then , '' sneered Coke .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 8]: `` Watts do n't mind 'em gray .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 7]: They 're old messmates of his .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 18]: It 's w ` en they 're pink or green that he fights shy of 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 32]: `` I hate rats of any sort -- '' began Watts hotly , spurred to anger by an audible snigger among the men , but De Sylva stopped his protest peremptorily .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 16]: It was idiotic , this bantering when the next half hour might be their last .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 16]: `` You must learn to guard your tongue , '' he said with harsh distinctness .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 15]: `` We can not have our plans marred by a fool 's outcry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 17]: Nevertheless , the chief officer of the _ Andromeda _ was far from being a fool .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 44]: He had cut an inglorious figure during the wreck , but he was sober enough now , and it hurt his pride to be jeered at by his own skipper and treated with contumely by one whom he privately classed as a Dago .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 26]: He had the good sense to realize that the present was no fit time for a display of temper ; but he nursed his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 22]: Dom Corria would have been well advised had he followed the counsel given so ungraciously , and guarded his own tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 23]: It might well be that the ex-President , whose fortunes were on the tiptoe of desperate hazard , was beginning to despair .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 25]: He may have scanned the meager forces at his disposal and felt that he was asking the gods for more than they could grant .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 26]: A few minutes earlier he had put forth the suave suggestion that Hozier should be given the speediest chance of securing the girl 's safety .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 26]: That was politic ; perhaps his stanch nerve was yielding to the strain , now that the two islanders were gone on their doubtful quest .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 14]: Be that as it may , his attitude did not encourage light conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 12]: Even Coke withheld some jibe at the unfortunate mate 's expense .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 9]: A chill silence fell on the little group .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 27]: The more imaginative among them were calculating the exact kind of lurch taken by the unstable raft that would mean `` drowning without a cry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 15]: Thus the minutes sped , until a dim shape emerged from the opposite blackness .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 13]: It came unheard , growing from nothing into something with ghostly subtlety .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 19]: Iris , a prey to many emotions , managed to stifle the exclamation of alarm that rose unbidden .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 11]: But Hozier read her distress in a hardly audible sob .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 12]: `` It is our friend , Marcel , '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 9]: `` So Domingo has made good his landing .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 3]: Be brave !
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 6]: The sea is quite calm .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 19]: This man has been to the island and back in less than a quarter of an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 7]: His confidence gave her new courage .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 11]: She even tried to turn danger itself into a jest .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 15]: `` We seem to be living in spasms just now , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 16]: `` We certainly crowd a good deal of excitement into a very few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 10]: The catamaran swung round and grated on the shingle .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 6]: Marcel was in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 6]: `` Are you ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 8]: asked De Sylva , bending toward Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 20]: `` Then you had better kneel behind Marcel , and steady yourself by placing your hands on his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 6]: Yes , that is it .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 10]: Do not change your position until you are ashore .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 7]: Now you , Mr. Hozier . ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 4]: Marcel murmured something .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 6]: `` Ah , good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 5]: cried De Sylva softly .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 10]: `` Domingo , too , has secured a catamaran .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 13]: He is bringing it at once in order to save time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 9]: A second spectral figure emerged from the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 25]: Without waiting for further instructions , Marcel swung his paddle , and the one craft passed the other in the center of the pool .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 9]: Iris felt Hozier 's hands on her waist .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 21]: He obeyed orders , and uttered no sound , but the action told her that she might trust him implicitly .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 28]: When the narrow cleft was traversed , and she saw the open sea on her right , there was ample need for some such assurance of guardianship .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 33]: Viewed from the cliff , the swell that broke on the half-submerged reef was of slight volume , but it presented a very different and most disconcerting aspect when seen in profile .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 35]: It seemed to be an almost impossible feat for any man to propel three narrow planks , top-heavy with a human freight , across a wide channel through which such a sea was running .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 22]: Indeed , Hozier himself , sailor as he was , felt more than doubtful as to the fate of their argosy .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 51]: But Marcel paddled ahead with unflagging energy once he was clear of the tortuous passage , and , before the catamaran had traveled many yards , even Iris was able to understand that the outlying ridge of rocks both protected their present track and created much of the apparent turmoil .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 31]: At last the raft , for it was little else , bore sharply out between two huge bowlders that might well have fallen from the mighty pile of Grand-p√®re itself .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 17]: Pointed and angular they were , and set like a gateway to an abode of giants .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 41]: Beyond , there was a shimmer of swift-moving water , with a silver mist on the surface , though from a height of a few feet it would have been easy to distinguish the bold contours of Fernando Noronha itself .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 40]: Marcel plied his paddle vigorously , and Iris thought they were heading against the current , since there was a constant swirl of white-tipped waves on both sides of the curved plank , and her dress soon became soaked .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 25]: But Hozier knew that one man could not drive a craft that had no artificial buoyancy in the teeth of a four-knot tidal stream .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 22]: Marcel was edging across the channel , and making good use of the very force that threatened to sweep him away .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 23]: Indeed , in less than five minutes , a definite clearing yet darkening of the atmospheric light showed that land was near .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 24]: The hiss of the ripple subsided , the tide ceased its chant , and a dark mass sprang into uncanny distinctness right ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 14]: The girl 's first sensation on nearing the island was an unpleasant one .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 19]: She was conscious of a slight but somewhat nauseating odor , quite unlike anything within her ken previously .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 19]: It suffused the air , and grew more pronounced as the catamaran crept noiselessly into a tiny bay .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 35]: Hozier sympathized with her distress ; knowing that acquaintance with an evil often helps to minimize its effect , he bent close to her ear and whispered the words : `` Mangrove swamp . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 6]: Iris had read of mangroves .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 19]: In a dim way , she classed them with tamarinds , and cocoa-palms , and other sub-tropical products .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 30]: At any rate , she was exceedingly anxious to tell Hozier that if mangroves tasted as they smelt she would need to be very hungry before she ate one !
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 7]: Marcel was endowed with quick ears .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 37]: Though Hozier 's whisper could hardly have reached him , he held up a warning hand , even while he brought the catamaran ashore on the shingle , so gently that not a pebble was disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 22]: He rose , a gaunt scarecrow , stepped off , and drew the shallow craft somewhat further up the sloping beach .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 8]: Then he helped Iris to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 32]: She became conscious at once that his thumb-nail was of extraordinary length , and -- so strangely constituted is human nature -- this peculiarity made a lasting impression on her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 24]: Hozier , thinking that he ought to remain near the catamaran , stood upright , but did not offer to follow the others .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 11]: Iris , filled with a sudden fear , hung back .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 12]: The Brazilian , aware of her resistance , sought its cause .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 11]: He saw Hozier , grinned , and beckoned to him .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 51]: So the three went in company , and at each upward stride the disagreeable stench , ever afterwards associated with Fernando Noronha in the girl 's memories , became less and less perceptible , until , after a short walk through a clump of banana trees , it vanished altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 41]: At that instant , when Iris was beginning to revel in the sweet incense of a multitude of unseen flowers , Marcel halted , motioned to Hozier to stand fast , and indicated that Iris was to come with him .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 8]: At once she shrank away in terror .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 29]: Though in some sense prepared for this parting , she felt it now as the crudest blow that fortune had dealt her during a day crowded with misfortunes .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 11]: In all likelihood , those two would never meet again .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 42]: She needed no telling as to the risk he would soon be called on to face , and her anguish was made the more bitter by the necessity that they should go from each other 's presence without a spoken word .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 12]: Nevertheless , she forced herself to extend a hand in farewell .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 7]: Her eyes were blinded with tears .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 8]: She knew that Hozier drew her nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 27]: With the daring of one who may well cast the world 's convention to the winds , he gathered her to his heart and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 14]: Then she uttered a little sob of happiness and sorrow , and fainted .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 36]: It was not until she was lying helpless in his embrace , with her head pillowed on his breast , and an arm thrown limply across his shoulder , that Philip understood what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 23]: He loved her , and she , the promised wife of another man , had tacitly admitted that she returned his love .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 37]: Born for each other , heirs of all the ages , they were destined to be separated under conditions that could not have been brought about by the worst tyrant that ever oppressed his fellow creatures .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 19]: Small blame should be his portion if in that abysmal moment there came to Philip a dire temptation .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 25]: There was every reason to believe that he and Iris , if they found some hiding-place on the island that night , might escape .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 37]: He could send Marcel crashing into the undergrowth with a blow , carry the unconscious girl somewhere , anywhere , until the darkness shrouded them , and wait for the dawn with some degree of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 28]: In a red fury of thought he pictured her face when she regained possession of her senses and was told that they had no more to fear .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 24]: He saw , with a species of fantastic intuition , that the island authorities would actually acclaim them for the tidings they brought .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 19]: And then , he would find those grave brown eyes of hers fixed on his in agonized inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 5]: What of the others ?
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 7]: Why had he betrayed his trust ?
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 19]: Dom Corria de Sylva had sent him ashore in advance of any among the little band of fugitives .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 8]: Marcel and Domingo were outside the pale .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 12]: Their lives , at least , were surely forfeit when recaptured .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 49]: It was not a prayer but a curse that Hozier muttered when Marcel whispered words he did not understand , but whose obvious meaning was that now the girl must be carried to the convict 's hut , since they were losing time , and time was all-important .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 15]: So they strode on , across ground that continued to rise in gentle undulations .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 33]: Even in his present frenzied mood , Hozier noticed that they were following the right bank of a rivulet , the catamaran being beached on the same side of its cove-like estuary .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 5]: Progress was rather difficult .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 32]: They were skirting a wood , and the trailers of a great scarlet-flowered bean and a climbing cucumber smothered the ground , canopied the trees , and swarmed over the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 20]: He could not distinguish these hindrances in the darkness , but he soon found that he must walk warily .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 26]: As for the effort entailed by his forlorn burden he did not give a thought to it until Marcel indicated that he must stand fast .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 9]: The Brazilian went on , leaving Hozier breathless .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 35]: Evidently he went to warn the inhabitants of a wretched hut , suddenly visible in the midst of a patch of maize and cassava , that there were those at hand who needed shelter .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 15]: A dog barked -- Marcel whistled softly , and the animal began to whimper .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 4]: The Brazilian vanished .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 24]: Hozier still held Iris in his arms ; his heart was beating tumultuously ; his throat ached with the labor of his lungs .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 21]: His straining ears caught rustlings among the grass and roots , but otherwise a solemn peace brooded over the scene .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 29]: Just beyond the hut , which was shielded from the arid hill by a grove of curiously contorted trees , the inner heights of the island rose abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 16]: Something that resembled a column of cloud showed behind the rugged sky-line of the land .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 17]: Even while he waited there , he saw a glint of light on its eastern side .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 28]: He fancied that under stress of emotion and physical weakness his eyes were deceiving him ; but the line of golden fire grew brighter and more definite .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 19]: It was broken but unwavering , and black shadows began to take form as part of this phenomenon .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 25]: Then he remembered the giant peak of Fernando Noronha , that mis-shapen mass which thrusts its amazing beacon a thousand feet into the air .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 32]: The rising moon was gilding El Pico long ere its rays would illumine the lower land -- that was all -- yet he hailed the sight as a token of deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 32]: It was not by idle chance that that which he had taken for a cloud should be transmuted into a torch ; there sprang into his heated brain a new trust .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 54]: He recalled the unceasing vigilance of One All-Powerful , who , ages ago , when His people were afflicted , `` went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way , and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 57]: Then Marcel came , and aroused him from the stupor that had settled on him , and together they entered into the hovel , where a dark-skinned woman and a comely girl uttered words of sympathetic sound when Iris was laid on a low trestle , and Hozier took a farewell kiss from her unheeding lips .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 21]: The Englishman stumbled away with his guide ; he fancied that Marcel warned him several times to be more circumspect .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 16]: He did his best , but , for the time , he was utterly spent .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 13]: At last the Brazilian signified that they were near a trysting place .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 18]: He uttered a cry like a night-jar 's , and the answer came from no great distance .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 50]: Soon they encountered Coke and De Sylva , who were awaiting them anxiously , and wondering , no doubt , why Hozier was missing , since Domingo and Marcel had fixed on an aged fig-tree as a rendezvous , and Hozier was not to be found anywhere near it .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 18]: The two boatmen hurried away , and De Sylva placed his lips close to Philip 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 6]: `` What went wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 14]: `` Iris -- Miss Yorke -- fainted , '' was the gasping reply .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 3]: `` Ah .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 7]: You had to carry her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 7]: De Sylva fumbled in a pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 5]: He produced a flask .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 6]: `` Here is some brandy .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 9]: I kept it for just such an extremity .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 8]: We can not have you breaking down .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 3]: Drink ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 21]: Two weary hours elapsed before the little army of the Grand-p√®re Rock was reunited on the shore of Cotton-Tree Bay .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 30]: Then there was a further delay , while their indefatigable scouts brought milk and water , some coarse bread , and a good supply of fruit from the hut .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 18]: It was part of their scheme that they should give their friend 's habitation a wide berth .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 24]: If their plans miscarried he was instructed to say that he had found the English lady wandering on the shore soon after daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 43]: In any event , there would be no evidence that he had entertained the invaders in his hovel ; otherwise , he would lose the first-class badge that permitted him , a convict , to dwell apart with his wife and daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 26]: It was with the utmost difficulty that the men could be restrained from expressing their delight when they were given water and milk to drink .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 69]: The water was poor , brackish stuff ; the milk was sour and had lost every particle of cream ; yet they deemed each a nectar of rank , and even the miserable Watts , who had long ago ascertained that the rustlings in the herbage were caused by countless numbers of rats and mice , was ready to acclaim beverages which he was too apt to despise .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 26]: About midnight there was a bright moon sailing overhead , and De Sylva gave a low order that they were to form in Indian file .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 20]: Marcel led , the ex-President himself followed , with San Benavides , Coke , and Hozier in close proximity .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 22]: Domingo brought up the rear , in order to prevent straggling , and assist men who might stray from the path .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 15]: Avoiding the cultivated land surrounding the creek , the party struck up the hillside .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 13]: A few plodding minutes sufficed to clear the trees and dense undergrowth .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 14]: A rough , narrow path led to the saddle of the central ridge .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 9]: They advanced warily but without any real difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 29]: Hozier took a listless interest in watching the furtive glances cast over his shoulder by San Benavides so long as the south coast of the island was visible .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 19]: At each turn in the mountain track the Brazilian officer searched the moonlit sea for the agreed signal .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 29]: At last , when the northern side also came in sight , and the whole island lay spread before them , San Benavides resigned himself to the inevitable .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 31]: For a little while , at least , he was perforce content to survey events through the eyes of his companions , and throw in his lot irrevocably with theirs .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 36]: Roughly speaking , Fernando Noronha itself , irrespective of the group of islands at its northeasterly extremity , stretches five miles from east to west , and averages a mile and a half in width .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 29]: From Cotton-Tree Bay , to which the catamarans had brought the small force , it was barely a mile to the village , convict settlement , and citadel .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 16]: Some few lights twinkling near the shore showed the exact whereabouts of the inhabited section .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 19]: Another mile away to the right lay Fort San Antonio , which housed the main body of troops .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 26]: Watch-fires burning on South Point , whence came the shells that disabled the _ Andromeda _ , revealed the presence of soldiers in that neighborhood .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 34]: De Sylva explained that a paved road ran straight from the town and landing-place to the hamlet of Sueste and an important plantation of cocoanuts and other fruit-bearing trees that adjoined South Point .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 10]: It was inadvisable to strike into that road immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 18]: A little more to the right there was a track leading to the Curral , or stockyard .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 15]: If they headed for the latter place the men could obtain some stout cudgels .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 44]: The convict peons in charge of the cattle should be overpowered and bound , thus preventing them from giving an alarm , and it was also possible to avoid the inhabited hillside overlooking the main anchorage until they were close to the citadel .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 36]: Then , crossing the fort road , they would advance boldly to the enemy 's stronghold , first making sure that the launch was moored in her accustomed station in the roadstead beneath the walls .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 55]: San Benavides would answer the sentry 's questions , there would be a combined rush for the guard-room on the right of the gate , and , if they were able to master the guard , as many of the assailants as possible would don the soldiers ' coats , shakos , and accouterments .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 32]: Granted success thus far , there should not be much difficulty in persuading the men in charge of the launch that a cruise round the island was to be undertaken forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 11]: Marcel would remain with them until the citadel was carried .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 65]: He would then hurry back to bring Iris across the island to an unfrequented beach known as the Porto do Concei√ßao , where he would embark her on a catamaran and row out to the steamer , which , by that time , would be lying off the harbor out of range of the troops who would surely be summoned from the distant fort .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 16]: The project bristled with audacity , and that has ever been the soul of achievement .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 37]: Even the two wounded men from the _ Andromeda _ took heart when they listened to De Sylva 's low-toned explanation , given under the shadow of a great rock ere the final advance was made .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 26]: If all went well at the beginning , the small garrison of the citadel would be astounded when they found themselves struggling against unknown adversaries .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 28]: Haste , silence , determination -- these things were essential ; each and all might be expected from men who literally carried their lives in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 11]: A keen breeze was blowing up there on the ridge .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 52]: A bank of cloud was rising in the southwest horizon , and , at that season , when the months of rain were normally at an end , the mere presence of clouds heralded another spell of broken weather , though the preceding gale had probably marked the worst of it .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 30]: Indeed , valuable auxiliary as the moon had proved during the march across rough country , it would be no ill hap if her bright face were veiled later .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 30]: The mere prospect of such an occurrence was a cheering augury , and it was in the highest spirits that the little band set out resolutely for the Curral .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 7]: Here they encountered no difficulty whatever .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 46]: Perhaps the prevalent excitement had drawn its custodians to the town , since they found no one in charge save a couple of barking dogs , while , if there were people in the cattle-keepers ' huts , they gave no sign of their presence .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 20]: A few stakes were pulled up ; they even came upon a couple of axes and a heavy hammer .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 44]: Equipped with these weapons , eked out by three revolvers owned by the Brazilians and the dapper captain 's sword , they hurried on , quitting the road instantly , and following a cow-path that wound about the base of a steep hill .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 16]: They met their first surprise when they tried to cross the road to the fort .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 12]: Quite unexpectedly , they blundered into a small picket stationed there .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 34]: Its object was to challenge all passers-by during the dark hours , and it formed part of the scheme already elaborated by the authorities for a complete search of every foot of ground .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 12]: But Brazilian soldiers are apt to be lax in such matters .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 10]: These men were all lying down , and smoking .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 19]: For a marvel , they happened to be silent when Marcel led his cohort into the open road .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 40]: They were listening , in fact , to the crackling of the undergrowth , though utterly unsuspicious of its cause , and the first intimation of danger was given by the startling challenge : `` Who goes there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 19]: It was familiar enough to island ears , and the convict answered readily : `` A friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 13]: `` Several friends , it would seem , '' laughed a voice .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 10]: `` Let us see who these friends are . ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 32]: Luckily , in response to De Sylva 's sibilant order , most of the _ Andromeda 's _ crew were hidden by the scrub from which they were about to emerge .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 9]: The soldiers rose , and strolled nearer leisurely .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 4]: `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 7]: shouted De Sylva , leaping forward .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 49]: There was a wild scurry , two or three shots were fired , and Hozier found himself on the ground gripping the throat of a bronzed man whom he had shoved backward with a thrust , for he had no time to swing his stake for a blow .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 51]: He was aware of a pair of black eyes that glared up at him horribly in the moonlight , of white teeth that shone under long moustachios of peculiarly warlike aspect , but he felt the man was as putty in his hands , and his fingers relaxed their pressure .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 4]: He looked around .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 11]: The fight was ended almost as soon as it began .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 15]: The soldiers , six in all , were on their backs in the roadway .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 6]: Two of them were dead .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 18]: The Italian sailor had been shot through the body , and was twisting in his last agony .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 12]: The bloodshed was bad enough , but those shots were worse .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 9]: They would set the island in an uproar .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 26]: The reports would be heard in town , citadel , and fort , and the troops would now be on the _ qui vive _ .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 9]: But De Sylva was a man of resource .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 6]: `` Strip the prisoners ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 18]: `` Take their arms and ammunition , but bind them back to back with their belts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 24]: `` Butt in there , me lads , '' vociferated Coke , who had accounted for one of the Brazilians with an ax .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 4]: `` Step lively !
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 19]: Now we 've got some uniforms an ' guns , we can rush that dam cittydel easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 10]: Hozier was busy relieving his man of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 31]: When the prone warrior realized that he was not to be killed , he helped the operation , but Philip was thinking more of Iris than of deeds of derring-do .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 11]: `` Why attempt to capture the citadel at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 24]: `` Now that we can make sufficient display , is there any reason that we should not go straight for the launch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 11]: `` Hi , mister , d'ye ` ear that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 6]: said Coke to De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 8]: `` There 's horse sense in it .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 23]: The whole bally place will be buzzin ' like a nest of wasps till they find out wot the shots meant . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 29]: `` I think it is a good suggestion , '' came the calm answer , `` provided , that is , the launch is in the harbor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 13]: `` She 's just as likely to be there now as later .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 14]: If she is n't , we must hark back to the first plan .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 8]: Now , you swabs , all aboard !
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 9]: See to them buckles afore you quit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 10]: A bell began to toll in the convict settlement .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 11]: Lights appeared in many houses scattered over the seaward slope .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 26]: In truth , Fernando Noronha had not been so badly scared since its garrison mutinied three years earlier because arrears of pay were not forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 30]: It was impossible to determine as yet whether or not the island steamer was at her berth , so they could only push on boldly and trust to luck .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 18]: Hozier , never for an instant forgetting Iris , saw that Marcel still remained with his leader .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 24]: Under these new circumstances , it certainly would be a piece of folly to send back until they were sure of the launch .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 37]: So he hurried after them , struggling the while into a coat far too small , though fortunate in the fact that his captive 's head was big in proportion to the rest of his body .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 21]: Some few men were met , running from the town to the main road where they had located the shooting .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 17]: Each breathlessly demanded news , and was forthwith given most disconcerting information by a savage blow .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 15]: The _ Andromeda _ had received no quarter , and her crew retaliated now .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 33]: They did not deliberately murder anyone , but they took good care that none of those whom they encountered would be in a condition to work mischief until the night was ended .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 33]: It was a peculiar and exasperating fact that although they were descending a steep incline to the harbor the presence of trees and houses rendered it impossible to see the actual landing-place .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 39]: Hence , there was no course open but to race on at the utmost speed , though De Sylva was careful to keep his small force compact , and its pace was necessarily that of its slowest members .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 20]: Among these was Coke , who had never walked so far since he was granted a captain 's certificate .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 46]: He swore copiously as he lumbered along , and , what between shortness of breath and his tight boots and clothing , the latter disability being added to by a ridiculously inadequate Brazilian tunic , he was barely able to reach the water 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 13]: Happily , the launch was there , moored alongside a small quay .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 39]: From the nearest building it was necessary to cross a low wharf some fifty yards in width , and De Sylva 's whispered commands could not restrain the eager men when escape appeared no longer problematical but assured .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 30]: They broke , and ran , an almost fatal thing , as it happened , since the soldiers whom Philip had seen from the rock were still on board .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 20]: One of them noticed the inexplicable disorder among a body of men some of whom resembled his own comrades .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 18]: He had heard the firing , and was discussing it with others when this strange thing happened .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 3]: He challenged .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 12]: San Benavides answered , but his voice was shrill and unofficer-like .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 5]: The engines were started .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 7]: A man leaped to the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 23]: He was in the act of casting a mooring rope off a fixed capstan when De Sylva shot him between the shoulder-blades .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 9]: `` On board , all of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 7]: shrieked the ex-President in a frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 7]: `` At 'em , boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 11]: gasped Coke , though scarce able to stagger another foot .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 6]: The men needed no bidding .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 29]: Sheets of flame leaped from the vessel 's deck as the soldiers seized their rifles and fired point-blank at these mysterious assailants who spoke in a foreign language .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 10]: But flame alone could not stop that desperate attack .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 17]: Some fell , but the survivors sprang at the Brazilians like famished wolves on their prey .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 6]: There was no more shooting .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 30]: Men grappled and fell , some into the water , others on deck , or they sprawled over the hatch and wrought in frantic struggle in the narrow cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 8]: The fight did not last many seconds .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 36]: An engineer , finding a lever and throttle valve , roared to a sailor to take the wheel , and already the launch was curving seaward when Hozier shouted : `` Where is Marcel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 12]: `` Lyin ' dead on the wharf , '' said Watts .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 6]: `` Are you certain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 25]: `` He was alongside me , an ' ' e threw is ` ands up , an ' dropped like a shot rabbit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 10]: `` Then who has gone for Miss Yorke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 4]: `` No one .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 15]: D'ye think that this d -- d President cares for anybody but hisself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 12]: Philip felt the deck throbbing with the pulsations of the screw .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 8]: The lights on shore were gliding by .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 62]: The launch was leaving Fernando Noronha , and Iris was waiting in that wretched hut beyond the hill , waiting for the summons that would not reach her , for Marcel was dead , and Domingo , the one other man who could have gone to her , was lying in the cabin with three ribs broken and a collar-bone fractured .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 26]: CHAPTER IX WHEREIN CERTAIN PEOPLE MEET UNEXPECTEDLY Iris came back from the void to find herself lying on a truckle bed in a dimly-lighted hovel .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 14]: A cotton wick flickered in a small lamp of the old Roman type .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 36]: It was consuming a crude variety of castor oil , and its gamboge-colored flame clothed the smoke-darkened rafters and mud walls in somber yet vivid tints that would have gladdened the heart of a Rubens .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 23]: This scenic effect , admirable to an artist , was lost on a girl waking in affright and startled by unfamiliar surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 14]: She gazed up with uncomprehending eyes at two brown-skinned women bending over her .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 27]: One , the elder , was chafing her hands ; the other , a tall , graceful girl , was stirring something in an earthenware vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 19]: She heard the girl murmur joyfully : `` Gra√ßas a Deus , elh ' abria lhes olhas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 29]: Iris was still wandering in that strange borderland guarded by unknown forces that lies between conscious life and the sleep that is so close of kin to death .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 28]: If in full possession of her senses , she might not have caught the drift of the sentence , since it was spoken in a guttural patois .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 23]: But now she understood beyond cavil that because she had opened her eyes , the girl was giving thanks to the Deity .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 45]: The first definite though bewildering notion that perplexed her faculties , at once clouded and unnaturally clear , was an astonished acceptance of the fact that she knew what the strange girl had said , though the phrase only remotely resembled its Spanish equivalent .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 46]: She gathered its exact meaning , word for word , and it was all the more surprising that both women should smile and say something quite incomprehensible as soon as Iris lifted herself on an elbow and asked in English : `` Where am I ?
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 7]: How did I come here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 12]: -LSB- Illustration : `` How did I come here ? '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 17]: Then she remembered , and memory brought a feeling of helplessness not wholly devoid of self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 41]: It was bad enough that her presence should add so greatly to the dangers besetting her friends ; it was far worse that she should have fainted at the very moment when such weakness might well prove fatal to them .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 5]: Why did she faint ?
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 21]: A lively blush chased the pallor from her cheeks , and a few strenuous heartbeats restored animation to her limbs .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 21]: Of course , in thinking that she had yielded solely to the stress of surcharged emotions , Iris was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 7]: What she really needed was food .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 49]: A young woman of perfect physique , and dowered with the best of health , does not collapse into unconsciousness because a young man embraces her , and each at the same moment makes the blissful discovery that the wide world contains no other individual of supreme importance .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 39]: Iris 's great-grandmother might have `` swooned '' under such circumstances -- not so Iris , who fainted simply because of the strain imposed by failure to eat the queer fare provided by De Sylva and his associates .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 39]: She hardly realized how hungry she was until the girl handed her the bowl , which contained a couple of eggs beaten up in milk , while small quantities of rum and sugar-cane juice made the compound palatable .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 4]: `` Bom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 10]: said the girl , `` bebida , senhora ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 32]: It certainly was good , and the senhora drank it with avidity , the mixture being excellent diet for one who had eaten nothing except an over-ripe banana during thirty hours .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 13]: Indeed , it would be no exaggeration to extend that period considerably .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 46]: Iris had left practically untouched the meals brought her by the steward during the gale , and the early morning cup of coffee , which would have proved most grateful after a storm-tossed night , was an impossible achievement owing to the lack of water .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 53]: So Iris tackled the contents of the bowl with a vigorous appetite oddly at variance with the seeming weakness that ended in a prolonged fainting fit , and the hospitable Brazilians , to whom this fair English girl was a revelation in feature and clothing , bestirred themselves to provide further dainties .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 17]: But , excepting some fruit , Iris had the wisdom to refuse other food just then .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 19]: Her thoughts were rapidly becoming coherent , and she realized that a heavy meal might be absolutely disastrous .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 20]: If the men made good their project she would be called on within an hour to cross the island .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 29]: It seemed reasonable that , hungry though she was , she would be better fitted to climb the island hills at a fast pace if she ate sparingly .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 23]: Still , she longed for a drink of water , and taxed her small stock of Spanish to make known her desire .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 31]: `` Agua , senhora , '' she said with a smile , and the delight of mother and daughter was great , since they thought she could speak their language .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 31]: Therein , of course , they were disappointed , but not more so than Iris when she tasted the brackish fluid alone procurable on the south coast of Fernando Noronha .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 8]: That was a fortunate thing in itself .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 55]: Only those who have endured real thirst can tell how hard it is to refrain from drinking deeply when water is ultimately obtained ; but the mixture of milk and eggs had already soothed her parched mouth and palate , and she quickly detected an unpleasantly salt flavor in the beverage they gave her .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 9]: Then she set herself to discover her whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 31]: The women were eager to impart information , but , alas , Iris 's brain had regained its every-day limitations , and she could make no sense of their words .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 35]: At last , seeing that the door was barred and the hut was innocent of any other opening , she stood upright , and signified by a gesture that she wished to go out .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 18]: There could be no mistaking the distress , even the positive alarm , created by this demand .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 28]: The girl clasped her hands in entreaty , and the older woman evidently tried most earnestly to dissuade her visitor from a proceeding fraught with utmost danger .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 15]: Being quite certain that they meant to be friendly , Iris sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 36]: She knew , of course , that Marcel would come for her , if possible , and the relief displayed by her unknown entertainers was so marked that she resolved to await his appearance quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 15]: She would not abandon hope till daylight crept through the chinks of the hut .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 10]: How soon that might be she could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 25]: It seemed but a few seconds since she felt Hozier 's arms around her , since her lips met his in a passionate kiss .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 10]: But , meanwhile , someone had brought her here .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 11]: Her dress , though damp , was not sopping wet .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 23]: Even the slight token of the beaten eggs showed how time must have sped while she was lying there oblivious of everything .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 53]: She tried again to question the women , and fancied that they understood her partly , as she caught the words `` meia noite , '' but it was beyond her powers to ascertain whether they meant that she had come there at midnight , or were actually telling her the hour .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 12]: At any rate , they were most anxious for her well-being .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 25]: The island housewife produced another dish , smiled reassuringly , and said , `` Manioc -- bom , '' repeating the phrase several times .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 11]: The compound looked appetizing , and Iris ate a little .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 21]: She discovered at once that it was tapioca , but her new acquaintance suggested `` cassava '' as an alternative .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 8]: The girl , however , nodded cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 31]: She had heard the gentry at Fort San Antonio call it tapioca , and her convict father cultivated some of the finer variety of manioc for the officers ' mess .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 23]: `` Ah , '' sighed Iris , smiling wistfully , `` I am making progress in your language , slow but sure .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 10]: But please do n't give me any mangroves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 12]: The girl apparently was quite fascinated by the sound of English .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 29]: She began to chatter to her mother at an amazing rate , trying repeatedly to imitate the hissing sound which the Latin races always perceive in Anglo-Saxon speech .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 6]: Her mother reproved her instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 12]: To make amends , the girl offered Iris a fine pomegranate .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 13]: Iris , of course , lost nothing of this bit of by-play .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 20]: It was almost the first touch of nature that she had discovered among the amazing inhabitants of Fernando Noronha .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 24]: These small amenities helped to pass the time , but Iris soon noted an air of suspense in the older woman 's attitude .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 19]: Though mindful of her guest 's comfort , Luisa Gomez had ever a keen ear for external sounds .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 36]: In all probability , she was disturbed by the distant reports of fire-arms , and it was a rare instance of innate good-breeding that she did not alarm her guest by calling attention to them .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 15]: Iris , amid such novel surroundings , could not distinguish one noise from another .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 34]: Night-birds screamed hideously in the trees without ; a host of crickets kept up an incessant chorus in the undergrowth ; the intermittent roaring of breakers on the rocks invaded the narrow creek .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 25]: The medley puzzled Iris , but the island woman well knew that stirring events were being enacted on the other side of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 35]: Her husband was there -- he had , indeed , prepared a careful alibi since Marcel visited him -- and wives are apt to feel worried if husbands are abroad when bullets are flying .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 94]: So , while the girl , Manoela , was furtively appraising the clothing worn by Iris , and wondering how it came to pass that in some parts of the world there existed grand ladies who wore real cloth dresses , and lace embroidered under-skirts , and silk stockings , and shining leather boots -- wore them , too , with as much careless ease as one draped one 's self in coarse hempen skirt and shawl in Fernando Noronha -- her mother was listening ever for hasty footsteps among the trailing vines .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 27]: At last , with a muttered prayer , she went to the door , and unfastened the stout wooden staple that prevented intruders from entering unbidden .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 5]: It was dark without .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 23]: Dense black clouds veiled the moon , and a gust of wind moaned up the creek in presage of a tropical storm .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 3]: Someone approached .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 8]: `` Is that you , Manoel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 8]: asked Luisa Gomez in a hushed voice .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 5]: There was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 5]: The woman drew back .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 18]: She would have closed the door , but a slim , active figure sprang across the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 5]: She shrieked in terror .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 31]: The new-comer was a Brazilian officer , one of those glittering beings whom she had seen lounging outside the Prindio -LSB- 1 -RSB- during her rare visits to the town .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 31]: She was hoping to greet her Manoel , she half expected to find Marcel , but to be faced by an officer was the last thing she had thought of .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 23]: In abject fear , she broke into a wild appeal to the Virgin ; the officer merely laughed , though not loudly .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 36]: `` Be not afraid , senhora -- I am a friend , '' he said with quiet confidence , and the fact that he addressed her so courteously was a wondrously soothing thing in itself .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 25]: But he raised a fresh wave of dread in her soul when he peered into the cabin and spoke words she did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 15]: `` I think you are here , mademoiselle , '' he said in French .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 13]: `` I am come to share your retreat for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 10]: Perchance by daybreak I may arrive at some plan .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 15]: At present , you and I are in difficulties , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 8]: Iris recognized the voluble , jerky speech .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 17]: A wild foreboding gripped her heart until she was like to shudder under its fierce anguish .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 8]: `` You , Captain San Benavides ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 10]: she asked , and her utterance was unnaturally calm .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 14]: `` I , mademoiselle , '' he said , `` and , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 4]: I am alone .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 5]: May I come in ?
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 23]: It is not well to show a light at this hour , seeing that the island is overrun with infuriated soldiers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 11]: The concluding sentence was addressed to Luisa Gomez in Portuguese .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 22]: Realizing instinctively that the man came as a friend , she stood aside , trembling , on the verge of tears .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 11]: He entered , and the door was closed behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 21]: The yellow gleam of the lamp fell on his smart uniform , and gilded the steel scabbard of his sword .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 40]: In that dim interior the signs of his three days ' sojourn on Grand-p√®re were not in evidence , and he had not been harmed during the struggle on the main road or in the rush for the launch .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 11]: He doffed his rakish-looking kepi and bowed low before Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 17]: Perhaps the white misery in her face touched him more deeply than he had counted on .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 30]: Be that as it may , a note of genuine sympathy vibrated in his voice as he said : `` I am the only man who escaped , mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 3]: The others ?
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 13]: Well , it is war , and war is a lottery . ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 14]: `` Do you mean that they have been killed , all killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 7]: she murmured with a pitiful sob .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 8]: `` I -- I think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 5]: `` You ... think ?
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 6]: Do you not know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 3]: He sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 8]: His hand sought an empty cigarette case .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 17]: Such was the correct military air , he fancied -- to treat misfortunes rather as jests .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 13]: He frowned because the case was empty , but smiled at Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 18]: `` It is so hard , mademoiselle , when one speaks these things in a strange tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 9]: Permit me to explain that which has arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 9]: We encountered a picket , and surprised it .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 20]: Having secured some weapons and accouterments , we hastened to the quay , where was moored the little steamship .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 8]: Unhappily , she was crowded with soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 10]: They fired , and there was a short fight .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 13]: I was knocked down , and , what do you call it ?
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 11]: -- _ √©tourdi _ -- while one might count ten .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 12]: I rose , half blinded , and what do I see ?
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 27]: The vessel leaving the quay -- full of men engaged in combat , while , just beyond the point , a warship is signaling her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 8]: It was a Brazilian warship , mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 11]: She showed two red rockets followed by a white one .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 14]: It was only a matter of minutes before she met the little steamship .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 15]: I tell you that it was bad luck , that -- a vile blow .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 6]: I was angry , yes .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 9]: I stamp my foot and say foolish things .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 5]: Then I run ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 5]: Iris made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 8]: She hid her face in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 7]: She could frame no more questions .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 28]: San Benavides was trying to tell her that Hozier and the rest had been overwhelmed by fate at the very instant escape seemed to be within reach .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 45]: The Brazilian , probably because of difficulties that beset him in using a foreign language , did not make it clear that he had flung himself flat in the dust when he heard the order to fire given by someone on board the launch .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 39]: He said nothing of a tragic incident wherein Marcel , shot through the lungs , fell over him , and he , San Benavides , mistaking the convict for an assailant , wrestled furiously with a dying man .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 45]: He even forgot to state that had he charged home with the others , he would either have met a bullet or gained the deck of the launch , and that his failure to reach the vessel was due to his own careful self-respect .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 8]: For San Benavides was not a coward .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 30]: He could be brave spectacularly , but he had no stomach for a fight in the dark , when stark hazard chooses some to triumph and some to die .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 33]: That sort of devilish courage might be well enough for those crude sailors ; a Portuguese gentleman of high lineage and proved mettle demanded a worthier field for his deeds of derring-do .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 2]: Saperlotte !
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 11]: If one had a cigarette one could talk more fluently !
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 40]: `` Believe me , mademoiselle , '' he went on , speaking with a proud humility that was creditable to his powers as an actor , `` the tears came to my eyes when I understood what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 8]: For myself , what do I care ?
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 13]: I would gladly have given my life to save my brave companions .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 41]: But I thought of you , solitary , waiting here in distress , so I hurried into the village , and my uniform secured me from interruption until I was able to leave the road and cross the hills . ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 14]: Then the lightning of a woman 's intuition pierced the abyss of despair .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 10]: Surely there were curious blanks in this thrilling narrative .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 21]: As was her way when thoroughly aroused , Iris stood up and seized San Benavides almost roughly by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 11]: Her distraught eyes searched his face with a pathetic earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 14]: `` Why do you think that the launch did not get away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 5]: `` It was dark .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 8]: The moon might have been in shadow .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 30]: If the launch met the warship and was seen , there must have been firing -- '' `` Ch√®re mademoiselle , there was much firing , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 5]: `` At sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 5]: The words came dully .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 9]: She was stricken again , even more shrewdly .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 21]: The gloom was closing in on her , yet she forced herself to drag the truth from his unwilling lips .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 13]: Of course , I could not wait there in that open place .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 7]: I was compelled to seek shelter .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 8]: Troops were running from town and citadel .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 7]: I avoided them by a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 10]: And my sole concern then was your safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 7]: `` Oh , my safety ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 4]: she wailed brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 13]: `` How does it avail me that my friends should be slain ?
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 7]: Why was I not with them ?
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 23]: I would rather have died as they died than live in the knowledge that I was the cause of their death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 10]: San Benavides essayed a confidential hand on her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 20]: She shrank from him ; he was not pleased but he purred amiably : `` Mademoiselle is profoundly unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 14]: Under such circumstances one says things that are unmerited , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 22]: If anyone is to blame , it is my wretched country , which can not settle its political affairs without bloodshed .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 18]: Ah , mademoiselle , I weep with you , and tender you my most respectful homage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 14]: A deluge of tropical rain beat on the hut with a sudden fury .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 9]: Conversation at once became difficult , nearly impossible .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 18]: Iris threw herself back on the trestle in a passion of grief that rivaled the outer tempest .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 22]: San Benavides , by sheer force of habit , dusted his clothes before sitting on the chair brought by Luisa Gomez .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 16]: The woman 's frightened gaze had dwelt on Iris and him alternately while they spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 31]: She understood no word that was said , but she gathered that the news brought by this handsome officer was tragic , woeful , something that would wring the heartstrings .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 8]: `` Was there fighting , senhor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 19]: she asked , close to his ear , her voice pitched in a key that conquered the storm .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 3]: He nodded .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 29]: He was very tired , this dandy ; now that Iris gave no further heed to him , he was troubled by the prospects of the coming day .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 8]: `` Were they soldiers who fought ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 4]: He nodded again .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 5]: `` No islanders ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 13]: Then he raised a hand in protest , though he laughed softly .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 13]: `` Your good man is safe , senhora , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 13]: `` Marcel told him to go to Sueste and tend his cattle .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 18]: When he comes home it will be his duty to inform the Governor that we are here .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 8]: He will be rewarded , not punished .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 6]: _ Sangue de Deus _ !
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 7]: I may be shot at dawn .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 11]: I pray you , let me rest a while . ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 21]: The girl , Manoela , weeping out of sympathy , crept to Iris 's side and gently stroked her hair .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 20]: Like her mother , she could only guess that the English lady 's friends were captured , perhaps dead .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 22]: Even her limited experience of life 's vicissitudes had taught her what short shrift was given to those who defied authority .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 21]: The Republic of Brazil does not permit its criminals to be executed , but it shows no mercy to rebels .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 19]: Manoela , of course , believed that the Englishmen were helping the imprisoned Dom Corria to regain power .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 17]: She remembered how a mutiny was once crushed on the island , and her eyes streamed .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 13]: Meanwhile , Luisa Gomez was touched by the good-looking soldier 's plight .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 28]: Never , since she came to Fernando Noronha to rejoin her convict husband , had she been addressed so politely by any member of the military caste .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 24]: The manners of the officers of the detachment at Fort San Antonio were not to be compared with those of Captain San Benavides .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 7]: Her heart went out to him .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 15]: `` We must try to help you , Senhor Capitano , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 16]: `` If the others are dead or taken , you may not be missed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 10]: He threw out his hands in an eloquent gesture .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 15]: Life or death was a matter of complete indifference to him , it implied .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 12]: `` We shall know in the morning , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 6]: `` Have you any cigarettes ?
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 10]: A milrei -LSB- 2 -RSB- for a cigarette ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 6]: `` But listen , senhor .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 12]: Why not take off your uniform and dress in my clothes ?
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 31]: You can cut off your mustaches , and wear a mantilha over your face , and we will keep you here until there is a chance of reaching a ship .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 9]: Certainly that is better than being shot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 5]: He glanced at Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 37]: Vanity being his first consideration , it is probable that he would have refused to be made ridiculous in her eyes , had not a knock on the door galvanized him into a fever of fright .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 20]: He sprang up and glared wildly around for some means of eluding the threatened scrutiny of a search party .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 11]: Luisa Gomez flung him a rough skirt and a shawl .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 48]: He huddled into a corner near the bed , -- in such wise that the figures of Iris and Manoela would cloak the rays of the lamp , -- placed his drawn sword across his knees , and draped the two garments over his head and limbs .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 22]: Then , greatly agitated , but not daring to refuse admittance to the dreaded soldiery , the woman unbarred the door .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 5]: A man staggered in .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 32]: He was alone , and a swirl of wind and rain caused the lamp to flicker so madly that no one could distinguish his features until the door was closed again .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 5]: But Iris knew him .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 28]: Though her eyes were dim with tears , though the new-comer carried a broken gun in his hands , and his face was blood-stained , she knew .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 31]: With a shriek that dismayed the other women -- who could not guess that joy is more boisterous than sorrow , she leaped up and threw her arms around him .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 8]: `` Oh , Philip , Philip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 14]: `` He told me you were dead ... and I believed him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 42]: The manner of her greeting was delightful to one who had faced death for her sake many times during the past hour , yet Hozier was so surprised by its warmth that he could find never a word at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 19]: But he had the good sense to throw aside the shattered rifle and return her embrace with interest .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 24]: Long ago exhausted in body , his mind reeled now under the bewildering knowledge that this most gracious woman did truly love him .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 21]: When they parted in that same squalid hut at midnight , he took with him the intoxication of her kiss .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 26]: Yet he scarce brought himself to believe that the night 's happenings were real , or that they two would ever meet again on earth .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 11]: And now , here was Iris quivering against his breast .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 9]: He could feel the beating of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 12]: The perfume of her hair was as incense in his nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 14]: She was clinging to him as if they had loved through all eternity .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 7]: No wonder he could not speak .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 16]: Had he uttered a syllable , he must have broken down like the girl herself .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 7]: San Benavides supplied a timely tonic .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 13]: Throwing aside the rags which covered him , he tried to rise .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 15]: Philip caught a glimpse of the uniform , the sheen of the naked sword .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 21]: He was about to tear himself from Iris 's clasp and spring at this new enemy when the Brazilian spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 5]: `` Mil diabos ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 26]: he cried in a rage , `` this cursed Inglez still lives , and here am I posing before him like an old hag . ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 42]: His voice alone saved him from being pinned to the floor by a man who had adopted no light measures with others of his countrymen during the past half-hour , as the dented gun-barrel , minus its stock , well showed .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 13]: But the captain 's mortified fury helped to restore Philip 's sanity .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 29]: Lifting Iris 's glowing face to his own , he whispered : `` Tell me , sweetheart , how comes it that our Brazilian friend is here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 18]: `` He ran away when some shots were fired , '' which was rather unfair of Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 19]: `` He said the launch had been sunk by a man-of-war -- '' `` But he is wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 5]: I saw no man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 5]: We captured the launch .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 10]: By this time she is well out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 11]: Unfortunately , Marcel was killed , and Domingo badly wounded .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 17]: There was no one to come for you , so I jumped overboard and swam ashore .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 25]: I had to fight my way here , and it will soon be known that there are some of us left on the island .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 14]: I thought that perhaps I might take you back to the Grand-p√®re cavern .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 7]: These people may give us food .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 18]: I have some few sovereigns in my pocket ... '' `` Oh , yes , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 8]: She was excited now and radiantly happy .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 11]: `` Of course , Captain San Benavides must accompany us .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 12]: He says the soldiers will shoot him if they capture him .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 7]: I , too , have money .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 15]: Let me ask him to explain matters to this dear woman and her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 11]: They have been more than kind to me already . ''
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 15]: She turned to the sulky San Benavides and told him what Hozier had suggested .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 14]: He brightened at that , and began a voluble speech to Luisa Gomez .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 17]: Interrupting himself , he inquired , in French , how Hozier proposed to reach the rock .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 5]: `` On a catamaran .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 21]: There are two on the beach , and I can handle one of them all right , '' said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 10]: `` But what is this yarn of a warship ?
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 30]: When last I sighted the launch she was standing out of the harbor , and the first clouds of the storm helped to screen her from the citadel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 3]: Iris interpreted .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 9]: San Benavides repeated his story of the rockets .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 22]: In her present tumult , the girl forgot the touch of realism with regard to the firing that he had heard .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 43]: Certainly there was a good deal of promiscuous rifle-shooting after the departure of the launch , but warships use cannon to enforce their demands , and the boom of a big gun had not woke the echoes of Fernando Noronha that night .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 21]: Philip deemed the present no time for argument ; he despised San Benavides , and gave no credence to him .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 12]: Just now the Brazilian was an evil that must be endured .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 10]: Luisa Gomez promised to help in every possible way .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 22]: Her eyes sparkled at the sight of gold , but the poor woman would have assisted them out of sheer pity .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 34]: Nevertheless , the gift of a couple of sovereigns , backed by the promise of many more if her husband devoted himself to their service , spurred her to a frenzy of activity .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 9]: There was not a moment to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 26]: The squall had spent itself , and a peep through the chinks of the door showed that the moon would quickly be in evidence again .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 42]: It was essential that they should cross the channel while the scattering clouds still dimmed her brightness ; so Manoela and her mother collected such store of food , and milk , and water , as they could lay hands on .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 27]: Well laden , all five hastened to the creek , and Hozier , Iris , and San Benavides , boarded the larger of the two catamarans .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 16]: The strong wind had partly dissipated the noisome odor , but it was still perceptible .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 9]: Iris was sure she would never like mangroves .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 45]: Having a degree of confidence in the queer craft that was lacking during their earlier voyage , they did not hesitate to stack jars and baskets against the curved prow in such a manner that the eatables would not become soaked with salt water .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 38]: Then , after a hasty farewell , during which Iris showed her gratitude to those kindly peasants by a hug and a kiss , Hozier pushed off and tried to guide the catamaran as Marcel had done .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 19]: Oddly enough , he and Iris now saw the majestic outlines of the Grand-p√®re for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 13]: The great rock rose above the water like some immense Gothic cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 18]: The illusion was heightened by a giant spire that towered grandly from the center of the islet .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 51]: It looked a shrine built by nature in honor of its Creator , a true temple of the infinite , and the semblance was no illusion to these three castaways , since they regarded it as a sanctuary to which alone , under Heaven , they might owe their lives .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 18]: Hozier , of course , realized that there was a certain element of risk in returning there .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 32]: The island authorities would surely endeavor to find out where the party of desperadoes had lain _ perdu _ between the sinking of the ship and the attack on the picket .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 43]: But the ill-starred Marcel had been confident that none could land on the rock who was not acquainted with the intricacies of the approach , and Philip was content to trust to the reef-guarded passage rather than seek shelter on the mainland .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 23]: Once embarked in the fairway , the management of the catamaran occupied his mind to the complete exclusion of all other problems .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 41]: He was puzzled by the discovery that the awkward craft was traveling too far to the westward , until he remembered that the tide had turned , and that the current was either slack or running in the opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 17]: Changing the paddle to the starboard side , he soon corrected this deviation in the route .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 17]: But he had been carried already a hundred yards or more out of the straight line .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 48]: To reach the two pointed rocks that marked the entrance to the secret channel , he was obliged to creep back along the whole shoreward face of the Grand-p√®re ; and to this accident was due a surprise that ranked high in a day replete with marvels .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 43]: When the catamaran rounded the last outlying crag , and they were all straining their eyes to find the sentinel pillars , they became aware that a small boat was being pulled cautiously toward them from the opposite side of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 3]: Iris gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 32]: She heard Hozier mutter under his breath , while San Benavides revealed his dismay by an oath and a convulsive tightening of the hands that rested on the girl 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 28]: Hozier strove with a few desperate strokes of the paddle to reach the shadows of the passage before the catamaran was seen by the boat 's occupants .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 5]: He might have succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 37]: Many things can happen at night and on the sea -- strange escapades and hair 's - breadth ` scapes -- thrills denied to stay-at-homes dwelling in cities , who seldom venture beyond a lighted area .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 35]: But there was even a greater probability that the unwieldy catamaran might be caught by the swell and dashed side-long against one of the half-submerged rocks that thrust their black fangs above the water .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 8]: Happily , they were spared either alternative .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 26]: At the very instant that their lot must be put to the test of chance , Coke 's hoarse accents came to their incredulous ears .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 12]: `` Let her go , Olsen , '' he was growling .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 22]: `` We 've a clear course now , an ' that dam moon will spile everything if we 're spotted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 19]: In this instance hearing was believing , and Philip was the first to guess what had actually occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 7]: `` Boat ahoy , skipper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 8]: he sang out in a joyous hail .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 4]: Coke stood up .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 7]: He glared hard at the reef .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 8]: `` Did ye ` ear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 10]: he cried to De Sylva , who was steering .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 32]: `` Sink me , I ` ope I ai n't a copyin ' pore ole Watts , but if that was n't Hozier 's voice I 'm goin ' dotty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 21]: `` It 's all right , skipper , '' said Philip , sending the catamaran ahead with a mighty sweep .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 12]: `` Miss Yorke is here -- Captain San Benavides , too .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 16]: I was sure you would look for us if you cleared the harbor safely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 39]: Then Coke proclaimed his sentiments in the approved ritual of the high seas , while the big Norseman at the oars swung the boat 's head round until both craft were traveling in company to the waiting launch .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 40]: But before anything in the nature of an explanation was forthcoming from the occupants of either the boat or the catamaran , a broad beam of white light swept over the crest of the island from north to south .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 23]: It disappeared , to return more slowly , until it rested on Rat Island , at the extreme northwest of the group .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 16]: It remained steady there , showing a wild panorama of rocky heights and tumbling sea .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 10]: `` A search-light , by G -- d ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 3]: growled Coke .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 14]: `` Then there really _ was _ a warship , '' murmured Iris .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 25]: said San Benavides , and his tone was almost gratified , for he had gathered that Hozier was skeptical when told of the rockets .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 13]: But in that respect , at least , he was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 22]: A man-of-war had entered the roadstead , and her powerful lamp was now scouring sea and coast for the missing launch .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 99]: And in that moment of fresh peril it was forgotten by all but one of the men who had survived so many dangers since the sun last gilded the peak of Fernando Noronha , that were it not for Iris having been left behind , and Philip 's mad plunge overboard to go to her , and the point-blank refusal of the _ Andromeda 's _ captain and crew to put to sea without an effort to save the pair of them , the launch would not now be hidden behind the black mass of the Grand-p√®re rock .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 7]: Nevertheless , the fact was patent .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 34]: Had the little vessel sailed to the west , in the assumption that her only feasible course lay in that direction , she must have been discovered by the cruiser 's far-seeing eye .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 8]: And what that meant needed no words .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 15]: The bones of the _ Andromeda _ supplied testimony at once silent and all-sufficing .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 8]: -LSB- 1 -RSB- The Governor 's residence .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 14]: -LSB- 2 -RSB- The Brazilian milrei is worth 55 cents , or 2s .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 3]: 3¬†1/2 d .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 10]: The Portuguese is worth only one-tenth of a cent .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 21]: CHAPTER X ON THE HIGH SEAS Again did that awe-inspiring wand of light describe a great arc in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 15]: But it was plain to be seen that it sprang from an altered base .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 6]: The warship was in motion .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 11]: She was about to steam around the group of islands .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 36]: Boat and catamaran raced at once for the launch ; a Babel of strange oaths jarred the brooding silence ; alarm , almost panic , stirred men 's hearts and bubbled forth in wild speech .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 16]: Under pressure of this new peril the instinct of self-preservation burst the bonds of discipline .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 41]: The first law of nature may be disregarded by heroes , but the _ Andromeda 's _ crew were just common sailormen , who did not know when they were heroic and did not care if they were deemed bestial .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 10]: It may be urged that they had suffered much .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 18]: Out of a ship 's company of twenty-two exactly one half had survived the day 's rigors .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 19]: Domingo was lying in the cabin , too seriously injured to be concerned whether he lived or died .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 41]: With him were two wounded soldiers , happily saved from the ruthless ferocity of the fight alongside the wharf , when every Brazilian in uniform found on deck was flung off to sink or swim as he was best able .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 19]: Indeed , it was during this phase of the struggle that Hozier managed to scramble on shore unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 21]: He landed at the same moment as enemies who were blind to every other consideration except their own dangerous plight .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 20]: Small wonder , then , if authority was cast to the winds now that capture seemed to be unavoidable .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 23]: Coke tried to still the tumult by thundering a command to Norrie , second engineer , to throw open the throttle valve .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 26]: He took the wheel in person , meaning to shape a course due east , and thus endeavor to avoid the cruiser 's baleful glance .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 13]: But some of the men realized instantly that this expedient would fail .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 9]: They were in no mood for half measures .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 9]: Norrie felt a bayonet under his left shoulder-blade .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 20]: Coke was roared down , and a hoarse voice growled : `` Me for the tall timbers , maties .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 9]: It 's each one for hisself now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 6]: `` Aye , aye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 9]: came the chorus ... `` Shove her ashore !
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 14]: ... Give us a chanst there ... We 've none at sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 13]: Dom Corria , being something of a fatalist , did not interfere .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 19]: On this cockleshell of a craft , among these rude spirits of alien races , he was powerless .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 16]: On land a diplomat and strategist of high order , here he was a cipher .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 14]: Moreover , he was beaten to his knees , and he knew it .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 10]: The arrival of the warship had upset his calculations .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 26]: After many months ' planning of flight , he had been forced , by the events of a few hours , into an aggressive campaign .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 36]: His little cohort had done wonders , it is true , but of what avail were these ill-equipped stalwarts against a fast-moving fort , armed with heavy guns and propelled by thousands of steam horses ?
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 5]: None , absolutely none .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 7]: Dom Corria drew San Benavides aside .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 6]: `` All is ended ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 4]: he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 13]: `` We shall never see Brazil again , Salvador _ meu _ !
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 10]: Carmela must find another lover , it seems . ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 37]: Salvador did not appear to be specially troubled by the new quest imposed on Carmela , but he was much perturbed by an uproar betokening disunion among the men who had already saved his life twice .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 8]: He was beginning to believe in them .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 12]: It was night , and they possessed a vessel under steam .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 18]: Why did they not hurry into the obscurity of the smooth dark plain that looked so inviting ?
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 18]: It was left to Hozier to solve a problem that threatened to develop into a disastrous brawl .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 14]: Danger sharpens a brave man 's wits , but love makes him fey .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 9]: To succor Iris was now his sole concern .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 24]: He swung a couple of the excited sailors out of his way and managed to stem the torrent of Coke 's futile curses .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 7]: `` Give in to them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 4]: he cried eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 11]: `` Tell them they are going ashore in the creek .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 6]: That will stop the racket .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 16]: If they listen to me , I can still find a means of escape . ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 9]: `` Avast yelpin ' , you swabs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 3]: bellowed Coke .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 16]: `` D'ye want to let every bally sojer on the island know where you are ?
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 8]: We 're makin ' for the creek .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 7]: Will _ that _ please you ?
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 10]: Now , Mr. Norrie , let her rip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 11]: The head of the launch swung toward the protecting shadows .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 18]: The men knew the bearings of Cotton-Tree Bay , so the angry voices yielded to selfish thought .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 37]: If it was to be _ sauve qui peut _ when the vessel grounded , there was ample room for thought , seeing that each man 's probable fate would be that of a mad dog .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 6]: Hozier seized the precious respite .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 16]: He spoke loudly enough that all should hear , and he began with a rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 35]: `` I am sorry that those of us who are left should have disgraced the fine record set up by the _ Andromeda 's _ crew since the ship struck , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 26]: `` Your messmates who fell fighting would hardly believe St. Peter himself if he told them that we were on the verge of open mutiny .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 6]: I am ashamed of you .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 11]: Let us have no more of that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 10]: Sink or swim , we must pull together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 13]: There was some discordant muttering , but he gained one outspoken adherent .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 6]: `` Bully for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 11]: said the man who had suggested tree-climbing as an expedient .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 5]: `` Shut up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 5]: was the wrathful answer .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 9]: `` You 've made plenty of row already .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 12]: I only hope you have not attracted attention on the island .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 26]: You may not have been heard , owing to the disturbance on the other side , but no thanks to any of you for that .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 11]: Our skipper 's first notion was to put to sea .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 5]: Was n't it natural ?
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 12]: Do you want to be hunted over Fernando Noronha at daybreak ?
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 23]: But he would have seen the uselessness of trying to slip the cruiser before the launch had gone a cable 's length .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 12]: Now , here is a scheme that strikes me as workable .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 10]: At any rate , it offers a forlorn hope .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 15]: There is a sharp bend in the creek just where the tidal water ends .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 17]: I fancy the launch will float a little higher up , but we must risk it .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 29]: We will take her in , unship the mast , tie a few boughs and vines on the funnel , and not twenty search-lights will find us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 13]: A rumble of approving murmurs showed that he had scotched the dragon .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 9]: It was even ready to become subservient again .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 19]: He continued rapidly : `` No vessel of deep draught can come close in shore from the east .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 30]: The cruiser will have the Grand-p√®re rock abeam within an hour , but , to make sure , two of you will climb the ridge and watch her movements .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 17]: The rest will load up every available inch of space with wood and water and food .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 11]: How can we win clear of Fernando Noronha without fuel ?
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 20]: It is a hundred to one that the launch would not steam twenty miles on her present coal supply .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 29]: Such as it is , we must keep it for an emergency , even if we are compelled to tear up the deck and dismantle the cabin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 7]: `` Talks like a book ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 11]: snorted Coke , and some of the men grinned sheepishly .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 19]: Hozier was coolly reminding them of those vital things which frenzy had failed wholly to take into account .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 6]: Confidence was reborn in them .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 29]: They wanted to cheer this fearless young officer who seemed to forget nothing , but the island promontories were so close at hand that perforce they were dumb .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 10]: The simplicity of the project was its best recommendation .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 16]: Sailors themselves , the mind of the cruiser 's commander was laid bare to them .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 23]: He would soon be convinced that the launch had passed him in the dark ere the search-light looked out over the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 25]: Long before the circuit of Fernando Noronha was completed he would be itching to rush at top speed along the straight line to Pernambuco .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 30]: It was a bold thing , too , to land on the island and stock their vessel for a voyage , the end of which no man could foresee .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 6]: The dare-devil notion fascinated them .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 40]: In that instant , the _ Andromeda 's _ crew returned to their allegiance , which was as well , since it was fated to be stiffly tested many times ere they were reported inside 1 degree West again .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 9]: Unfortunately , Coke was in a raging temper .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 8]: Never before had his supremacy been challenged .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 14]: Having lost control over his men , he owed its restoration to Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 23]: Such a fact was gall and wormwood to a man of his character , and he was mean-souled enough to be vindictive .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 29]: Promising himself the future joy of pounding to a jelly the features of every mother 's son among the forecastle hands , he began to snarl his orders .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 17]: `` Watts , you must leg it to the sky-line , an ' pipe the cruiser .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 19]: Olsen , you go , too , an ' see that Mr. Watts does n't find a brewery .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 13]: Hozier , p ` raps you 'd like to rig the mistletoe .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 10]: Miss Yorke 'll ` elp , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 26]: It 's up to you , mister , an ' his nibs with the sword , to parly-voo to the other convicts about the grub .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 8]: Is there a nigger 's wood-pile handy ?
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 9]: If not , we must collar the hut .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 9]: I 'll take care of the stowage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 35]: He meant each jibe to hurt , and probably succeeded , but Watts was too despondent , and Hozier and De Sylva too self-controlled , to say aught that would add to their difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 15]: Nevertheless , he was answered , from a quarter whence retort was least expected .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 17]: `` You must modify your instructions , Captain Coke , '' said Iris with quiet scorn .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 17]: `` It would be a shameful act to destroy the house of those who befriended us .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 48]: They gave freely of their stores , as you will see by the supplies lashed to the catamaran , and will assist us further if Senhor De Sylva appeals to them -- '' `` You can safely leave that to me , '' broke in Dom Corria .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 10]: But Iris was not to be placated thus easily .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 9]: `` I know that , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 25]: `` I only wished Captain Coke to understand that if he can not make clear his meaning he should obey rather than command . ''
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 11]: `` The lady ` as ` ad the last word .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 10]: Now let 's get busy , '' sneered Coke .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 19]: Hozier , who had not quitted his side since the incipient outbreak was quelled , gripped his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 19]: `` There is a pile of wood near the cottage , '' he said in Coke 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 6]: `` I saw it there .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 6]: It must be paid for .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 6]: Have you any money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 11]: `` A loose quid or two -- no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 7]: `` A sovereign will be ample .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 11]: Miss Yorke has already given the owners two pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 5]: `` Wot for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 5]: `` For their kindness .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 24]: You are all there when it comes to a scrap , skipper , but at most other times you ought to be muzzled .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 7]: No , do n't talk now .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 27]: We will discuss the point on some more suitable occasion , when we can deal with it fully , and Miss Yorke is not present . ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 19]: Philip spoke in a whisper , but the low pitch of his voice did not conceal its menace .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 28]: He was longing to twine his fingers round Coke 's thick neck , and some hint of his desire was communicated by the clutch of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 5]: Coke shook himself free .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 23]: He feared no man born , but it would be folly to attack Hozier then , and he was not a fool .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 12]: `` Let go , you blank ijjit , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 10]: `` I 've no grudge ag ` in you .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 28]: If we pull out of this mess you 'll ` ave to square matters wi ' David Verity an ' that other ole ninny , Dickey Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 10]: She 's promised to ` im , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 12]: Told me so ` erself , so there 's no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 26]: I got me rag out , I admit , an ' ` oo would n't after bein ' ` owled down by those swine forrard .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 3]: My godfather !
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 14]: Watch me put it over 'em w ` en I get the chanst .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 6]: Stop ` er , Norrie !
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 14]: There 's plenty of way on ` er to round that bend . ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 36]: Hozier reflected that he had chosen an odd moment to quarrel with his captain , whose mordant humor in the matter of the mistletoe was only accentuated by his reference to Iris 's reported engagement .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 14]: The pungent smell of the mangrove swamp was wafted now to his nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 19]: It brought a species of warning that the disagreeable conditions of life in Fernando Noronha were yet active .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 36]: It was not pleasant to be thus suddenly reminded of pitfalls that might exist in England ; meanwhile , here was the launch thrusting her nose into the mud and shingle of this malevolent island .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 33]: To his further annoyance , San Benavides , who depended on his compatriot for a summary of the latest scheme , asked Iris to accompany De Sylva and himself to the hut .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 13]: `` They are stupid creatures , these peasants , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 12]: `` When they see you they will not be frightened . ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 15]: There was so much reason in the statement that Iris was a ready volunteer .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 40]: Soon all hands were at work , and it was due to the girl 's forethought that strips of linen were procured from Luisa Gomez , and healing herbs applied to the cuts and bruises of the injured men .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 24]: Sylva was all for leaving the two soldiers on the island , but Coke 's sailor-like acumen prevented the commission of that blunder .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 16]: `` No , that will never do , '' he said , with irritating offhandness .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 23]: `` These jokers will be found at daylight , an ' they 'll be able to say exactly wot time we quit .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 14]: The wimmin can make out they was scared stiff an ' darsent stir .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 9]: It ` ud be different with the sojers .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 28]: An ' we ai n't goin ' to have such a ` eart-breakin ' start , even if the cruiser clears away soon after two o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 10]: `` Where do you propose to make for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 7]: `` Where d'ye think , mister ?
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 20]: Nor ' - east by nor ' , to be sure , until we sight some homeward-bound ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 5]: There was a pause .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 39]: The pair could talk unheard , since they were standing on the bank , and the men were either loading firewood and fruit and cassava , or stripping trees and vines to hide the superstructure of the launch .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 10]: `` You mean to abandon everything , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 4]: said De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 19]: He seemed to be watching the onward sweep of the search-light as the warship went to the north .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 5]: But Coke was shrewd .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 18]: He felt that there was something behind the words , and he suspected the ex-President 's motives .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 15]: `` I do n't see any ` elp for it , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 11]: `` Gord 's trewth , wot is there to abandon ?
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 23]: I 've lost me ship , an ' me money , an ' me papers , an ' ` arf me men .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 18]: Unless one was lookin ' for trouble , this ai n't no treasure island , mister . ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 9]: `` Yet it might be made one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 5]: `` As how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 19]: `` Do you not realize how greatly the members of the present Government fear my return to Brazil ?
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 13]: Here , I am their prisoner , practically friendless , almost alone .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 30]: They dare not kill me by process of law , yet they are moving heaven and earth to prevent my escape , or shoot me down in the act .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 15]: Because they know that the people are longing to hail me as President again .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 16]: Suppose you and your men took me to Pernambuco -- '' `` S'pose hell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 3]: snapped Coke .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 4]: `` Please listen .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 12]: You can but refuse when you look at the facts fairly .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 34]: If , as I say , I were put ashore at Pernambuco , or at any other of half a dozen ports I can name , I should be among my own followers .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 46]: You , Captain Coke , and every officer and man of your ship , and her owners , and the relatives of those who have lost their lives , would not only be paid all just claims by the new Government , but adequately rewarded .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 11]: In your own case , the recompense would be princely .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 25]: But , assuming that we board a vessel bound for Europe , what certainty have you that you will ever receive a penny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 20]: `` Oh , reely , that 's comin ' it a bit thick , mister , '' growled Coke .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 12]: `` You believe I am exaggerating the difficulties of your position ?
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 3]: Pray consider .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 6]: Your vessel is broken up .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 24]: She was fired on while at anchor on the wrong side of the island , on the very day selected for my escape .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 76]: You and your men manage to dodge the bullets , and , under my leadership , assisted by Captain San Benavides , you overrun the place by night , kill several soldiers , seize a launch , despoil peasants of their crops and stores , and make off with a good deal of property belonging to the Brazilian Government , not to mention the presence in your midst of such a significant personage as myself .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 19]: Speaking candidly , Senhor Captain , what chance have you of convincing any international court of your innocence ?
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 11]: Who will believe that you were not a true filibuster ?
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 9]: That is what Brazil will say you are .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 6]: How will you disprove it ?
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 13]: In any event , who will enforce your claims against my country ?
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 23]: English public opinion would never compel your Government to take action in such an exceedingly doubtful case , now would it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 28]: `` If we was to try and land you in Brazil , we 'd bust up our claim for good an ' all , '' muttered Coke .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 19]: Though this was a powerful argument against De Sylva 's theory , it revealed certain qualms of perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 17]: The other man 's brilliant eyes gleamed for an instant , but he guarded his voice .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 7]: He was in his element now .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 12]: When words were weapons he could vanquish a thousand such adversaries .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 10]: `` I think otherwise , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 24]: `` A judge might well hold that in a small vessel like the launch you were entitled to make for the nearest land .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 12]: But I grant you that point ; it is really immaterial .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 8]: If I fail , you lose everything .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 16]: Accept my offer , and you have a reasonable chance of winning a fortune . ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 8]: `` Wot exactly is your offer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 5]: `` Ample compensation officially .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 9]: Five thousand pounds to you in person . ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 5]: `` Five thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 8]: Coke cleared a throat husky with doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 25]: He scratched his head under the absurd-looking kepi which he was still wearing ; for a moment , his lips set in grim calculation .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 20]: `` That ` ud make things pretty easy for the missus an ' the girls , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 22]: `` An ' there 's no new ship for me w ` en Dickey Bulmer cocks ` is eye at Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 24]: It 's a moral there 'll be a holy row between ` im an ' David ... D'ye mean it , mister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 31]: `` Even if I fail , and my life is spared , I will pay you the money out of my own private funds , '' was the vehement reply .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 11]: `` Well , well , leave the job to me .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 10]: You sawr ` ow them tinkers jibbed just now .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 13]: I must ` umor 'em a bit , d -- n 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 13]: But wait till the next time some of 'em ships under me .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 12]: Lord luv ' a duck , wo n't I skin 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 5]: Not ` arf ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 22]: De Sylva , with all his admirable command of English , could not follow the Coke variety in its careless freedom .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 6]: But he knew his man .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 29]: Though bewildered by strange names and stranger words , he was alive to the significance of things being made easy `` for the missus and the girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 14]: So , even this gnarled sea-dog had a soft spot in his heart !
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 38]: On the very brink of the precipice his mind turned to his women-kind , just as De Sylva himself had whispered a last memory of his daughter to San Benavides when their common doom was seemingly unavoidable .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 26]: He would urge no more , since Coke was willing to fall in with his designs , but he could not forbear from clinching matters .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 11]: `` I promise on my honor -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 22]: But the nearer surface of the sea flashed into a dazzling distinctness , and Coke dragged him down to the launch .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 25]: The cruiser had rounded Rat Island , and was devoting one sweeping glance eastward ere she sought her prey in creek or tortuous channel .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 6]: The men were summoned hastily .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 36]: Watts and Olsen had been warned to crouch behind the rocks on the crest , while those who remained near the launch were told to hide among the trees or crowd into the small cabin .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 7]: Movement of any kind was forbidden .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 26]: There was no knowing who might be astir on the hills , and a sharp eye might note the presence of foreigners in Cotton-Tree Bay .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 21]: Hozier had not forgotten the risk of detection from the shore , and the vessel was plentifully decorated with greenery .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 16]: The long , large-leafed vines and vigorous castor-oil plants were peculiarly useful at this crisis .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 50]: Trailing over the low freeboard into the water , they screened the launch so completely that Watts and the Norwegian , perched high above the creek at a distance of three hundred yards , could only guess her whereabouts when the search-light made the Gomez plantation light as day .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 13]: The cruiser evidently discovered traces of the _ Andromeda _ on Grand-pere .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 22]: She stopped an appreciable time , and created a flutter in many anxious hearts by a loud hoot of her siren .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 21]: It did not occur to anyone at the moment that she was signaling to the troops bivouacked on South Point .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 11]: De Sylva was the first to read this riddle aright .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 21]: He whispered his belief , and it soon won credence , since the warship continued her scrutiny of the coast-line .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 11]: At last , after a wearying delay , she vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 19]: Five minutes later , Watts and Olsen brought the welcome news that she was returning to the roadstead .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 16]: It was then half-past two o'clock , and the sun would rise soon after five .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 10]: Now or never the launch must make her effort .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 30]: Ready hands tore away her disguise , she was tilted by crowding in the poop nearly every man on board , the engines throbbed , and she was afloat .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 17]: At daybreak the thousand-foot peak of Fernando Noronha was a dark blur on the western horizon .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 14]: No sail or smudge of smoke broke the remainder of the far-flung circle .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 8]: The fugitives could breathe freely once more .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 5]: They were not pursued .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 14]: Iris fell asleep when assured that the dreaded warship was not in sight .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 21]: Hozier , too , utterly exhausted by all that he had gone through , slept as if he were dead .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 34]: Coke , whose iron constitution defied fatigue , though it was with the utmost difficulty that he had walked across the narrow breadth of Fernando Noronha , took the first watch in person .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 34]: He chatted with the men , surprised them by his candor on the question of compensation , and announced his resolve to make for the three-hundred-mile channel between Fernando Noronha and the mainland .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 17]: `` You see , it 's this way , me lads , '' he explained affably .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 39]: `` We 're short o ' vittles an ' bunker , an ' if we kep ' cruisin ' east in this latitood we 'd soon be drawrin ' lots to see ` oo 'd cut up juiciest .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 19]: So we must run for the tramp 's track , which is two hundred miles to the west .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 32]: We 'll bear north , an ' that rotten cruiser will look south for sartin , seein ' as ` ow they know we ` ave the next President aboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 6]: Coke paused to take breath .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 19]: `` Wot a pity we ca n't give ` im a leg up , '' he added confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 15]: `` It ` ud be worth a pension to every man jack of us .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 13]: ` Ere ' e is , special freight , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 12]: W ' y _ ` e 'd sign anythink _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 16]: Once the train was laid , it was a simple matter to fire the mine .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 20]: When Hozier awoke , to find the launch heading west , he was vastly astonished by Coke 's programme .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 16]: It was all cut and dried , and there was really nothing to cavil at .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 40]: If they met a steamship , and she stopped in response to their signals , her captain would be asked to take care , not only of Miss Yorke , but of any other person who shirked further adventure .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 21]: As for Coke , and Watts , and the majority of the men , they were pledged to De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 33]: Even Norrie , the engineer , a hard-headed Scot , meant to stick to the launch until the President that was and would be again was safely landed among his expectant people .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 10]: Watts let the cat out of the bag later .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 43]: `` Those of us ` oo do n't leave Dom Wot 's - ` is-name in the lurch are to get ten years ' full pay , extry an ' over an ' above wot the court allows , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 6]: `` Just think of it !
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 8]: Do n't it make your mouth water ?
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 14]: Reminds me of a chap I wonst read about in a trac ' .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 10]: It tole ` ow ' e took to booze .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 50]: One ` ot Sunday , bein ' out for a walk , ' e swiped ` arf a pint of ginger beer , the next ' e tried shandy-gaff , the third ' e went the whole hog , an ' then ' e never stopped for ten years .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 3]: My godfather !
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 12]: Ten years ' pay an ' a ten years ' drunk !
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 12]: It 's enough to make a sinner of any man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 3]: Hozier laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 21]: Two days ago he would have asked no better luck than the helping of Dom Corria to regain his Presidentship .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 8]: Now , there was Iris to protect .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 35]: He would not be content to leave her in charge of the first grimy collier they encountered , nor was he by any means sure that she would agree to be thus disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 14]: He was puzzled by the singular unanimity of purpose displayed by his shipmates .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 6]: But that was their affair .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 16]: His was to insure Iris 's safety ; the future he must leave to Providence .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 10]: And , indeed , Providence contrived things very differently .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 13]: By nightfall the launch was a hundred miles west of the island .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 37]: Norrie got eight knots out of her , but it needed no special calculation to discover that she would barely make the coast of Brazil if she consumed every ounce of coal and wood on board .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 20]: The engines were strong and in good condition , but she had no bunker space for a long voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 23]: Were it not for Hozier 's foresight she would have been drifting with the Gulf Stream four hours after leaving the island .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 27]: As it was , unless they received a fresh supply of fuel from another ship , they must unquestionably take the straightest line to the mainland .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 27]: During the day they had sighted three vessels , but at such distances that signaling was useless , each being hull down on their limited horizon .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 8]: Moreover , they had to be cautious .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 23]: The cruiser , trusting to her speed , might try a long cast north and south of the launch 's supposed path .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 31]: She alone , among passing ships , would be scouring the sea with incessant vigilance , and it behooved them , now as ever , not to attract her attention .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 17]: They were burning wood , so there was no smoke , and the mast was unstepped .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 11]: Yet the hours of daylight were tortured by constant fear .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 13]: Even Iris was glad when the darkness came and they were hidden .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 8]: At midnight a curious misfortune befell them .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 32]: The compass had been smashed during the fight , and not a sailor among them owned one of the tiny compasses that are often worn as a charm on the watchchain .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 31]: This drawback , of little consequence when sun or stars could be seen , assumed the most serious importance when a heavy fog spread over the face of the waters .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 22]: The set of the current was a guide of a sort , but , as events proved , it misled them .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 46]: Man is ever prone to over-estimate , and such a slight thing as the lap of water across the bows of a small craft was sure to be miscalculated ; they contrived to steer west , it is true , but with a southerly inclination .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 16]: At four o'clock , by general reckoning , they were mid-way between island and continent .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 13]: They were all wide awake , too weary and miserable to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 8]: Suddenly a fog-horn smote the oppressive gloom .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 4]: It drew near .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 7]: A huge blotch crossed their bows .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 9]: They could feel it rather than see it .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 23]: They heard some order given in a foreign language , and De Sylva whispered : `` The _ Sao Geronimo _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 5]: `` The wot-ah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 9]: demanded Coke , who was standing beside him .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 5]: `` The cruiser ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 3]: Coke listened .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 10]: He could distinguish the half-speed beating of twin screws .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 41]: He knew at once that the ex-President must have recognized the warship as she passed the creek , but , by some accident , had failed to mention her name during the long hours that had sped in the meantime .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 10]: The sinister specter passed and the launch crept on .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 8]: Everyone on board was breathless with suspense .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 17]: Faces were shrouded by night and the fog , but some gasped and others mumbled prayers .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 21]: One of the wounded soldiers shouted in delirium , and a coat was thrust over his head with brutal force .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 11]: The fog-horn blared again , two cables ' lengths distant .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 8]: They were saved , for the moment !
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 14]: In a little while , perhaps twenty minutes , they heard another siren .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 13]: It sounded a different note , a quaintly harsh blend of discords .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 15]: Whatsoever ship this might be , it was not the _ Sao Geronimo _ .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 22]: And in that thrilling instant there was a coldness on one side of their faces that was not on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 9]: Moist skin is a weather-vane in its way .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 6]: A breeze was springing up .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 20]: Soon the fog would be rolled from off the sea and the sun would peer at them in mockery .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 29]: Coke 's gruff voice reached every ear : `` This time we 're nabbed for keeps unless you all do as I bid you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 12]: `` When the fog lifts , the cruiser will see us .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 8]: There 's only one thing for it .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 9]: Somewhere , close in , is a steamer .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 13]: She 's a tramp , by the wheeze of ` er horn .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 13]: We 've got to board ` er an ' sink the launch .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 19]: If she 's British , or American , O.K. , as ` er people will stand by us .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 30]: If she 's a Dago , we 've got to collar ` er , run every whelp into the forehold , an ' answer the cruiser 's signals ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 12]: That 's the sittiwation , accordin ' to my reckonin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 9]: Now , ` oo 's for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 25]: `` Butt right in , skipper , '' said a gentleman who claimed Providence , Rhode Island , as the place of his nativity .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 30]: Hozier , who had contrived to draw near Iris while Coke was speaking , breathed softly , so that none other could hear : `` This is rank piracy .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 8]: But what else can we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 6]: `` Is it wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 11]: `` Well -- no , provided we kill no one .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 27]: We are justified in saving our own lives , and the average German or Italian shipmaster would hand us over to the Brazilians without scruple . ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 9]: Iris was far from Bootle and its moralities .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 19]: `` I do n't care what happens so long as you are not hurt , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 9]: `` Mr. Hozier , '' said Coke thickly .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 11]: `` You 've got good eyes an ' quick ears .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 19]: Lay out as far forrard as you can , an ' pass the word for steerin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 3]: Hozier obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 13]: The discordant bleat of a foghorn came again , apparently right ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 19]: In a few seconds he caught the flapping of a propeller , and silenced the launch 's engines .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 20]: `` We are close in now , '' he said to Coke , after a brief and noiseless drift .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 8]: `` Why not try a hail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 5]: `` Ship ahoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 11]: shouted Coke , with all the force of brazen lungs .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 8]: The screw of the unseen ship stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 9]: The sigh of escaping steam reached them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 4]: _ Holla _ !
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 6]: _ Wer rufe _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 5]: was the gruff answer .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 11]: `` Sink me if it ai n't a German ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 21]: growled Coke , _ sotto-voce _ , `` Norrie , you must stick here till I sing out to you .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 16]: Then open your exhaust an ' unscrew a sea-cock ... Wot ship is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 4]: he vociferated aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 11]: Some answer was forthcoming -- what , it mattered not .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 13]: The launch bumped into the rusty ribs of a twelve-hundred ton tramp .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 6]: A rope ladder was lowered .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 48]: A round-faced Teuton mate -- fat and placid -- was vastly surprised to find a horde of nondescripts pouring up the ship 's side in the wake of a short , thick , bovine-looking person who neither understood nor tried to understand a word he was saying .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 16]: These extraordinary visitors from the deep brought with them a girl and three wounded men .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 13]: By this time the captain was aroused ; he spoke some English .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 6]: `` Vas iss diss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 17]: he asked , surveying the newcomers with amazement , and their bizarre costumes with growing nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 8]: `` Vere haf you coomed vrom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 10]: Coke pushed him playfully into the cook 's galley .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 10]: `` This is too easy , '' he chortled .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 8]: `` Set about 'em , you swabs .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 10]: Do n't hurt anybody unless they ax for it .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 17]: Round every son of a gun into the fo ` c ` sle till I come .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 8]: Mr. Watts , the bridge for you .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 6]: Olsen , take the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 13]: Mr. Hozier , see wot you can find in their flag locker .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 7]: _ Now _ , Mr. Norrie !
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 4]: Sharp for it .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 8]: You 're wanted in the engine-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 38]: And that is how ex-President Dom Corria Antonio De Sylva acquired the nucleus of his fleet , though , unhappily , an accident to a sea-cock forthwith deprived him of a most useful and seaworthy steam launch .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 53]: CHAPTER XI A LIVELY MORNING IN EXCHANGE BUILDINGS Coke and his merry men became pirates during the early morning of Thursday , September 2d ; the curious reader can ascertain the year by looking up `` Brazil '' in any modern Encyclopedia , and turning to the sub-division `` Recent History . ''
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 78]: On Monday , September 6th , David Verity entered his office in Exchange Buildings , Liverpool , hung his hat and overcoat on their allotted pegs , swore at the office boy because some spots of rain had come in through an open window , and ran a feverish glance through his letters to learn if any envelopes bearing the planetary devices of the chief cable companies had managed to hide themselves among the mass of correspondence .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 5]: The act was perfunctory .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 31]: Well he knew that telephone or special messenger would speedily have advised him if news of the _ Andromeda _ had arrived since he left the office on Saturday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 23]: But it is said that drowning men clutch at straws , and the metaphor might be applied to Verity with peculiar aptness .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 37]: He was sinking in a sea of troubles , sinking because the old buoyancy was gone , sinking because many hands were stretched forth to push him under , and never one to draw him forth .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 8]: There was no cablegram , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 44]: Dickey Bulmer , who had become a waking nightmare to the unhappy shipowner , had said there would n't be -- said it twelve hours ago , after wringing from Verity the astounding admission that Iris was on board the _ Andromeda _ .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 12]: It was not because the vessel was overdue that David confessed .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 14]: Bulmer , despite his sixty-eight years , was an acute man of business .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 26]: Moreover , he was blessed with a retentive memory , and he treasured every word of the bogus messages from Iris concocted by her uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 31]: They were lucid at first , but under the stress of time they wore thin , grew disconnected , showed signs of the strain imposed on their author 's imagination .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 19]: Bulmer , a typical Lancashire man , blended in his disposition a genial openhandedness with a shrewd caution .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 43]: He could display a princely generosity in dealing with Verity as the near relative and guardian of his promised wife ; to the man whom he suspected of creating the obstacles that kept her away from him he applied a pitiless logic .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 6]: The storm had burst unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 59]: Bulmer came to dinner , ate and drank and smoked in quiet amity until David 's laboring muse conveyed his niece 's latest `` kind love an ' good wishes , '' and then -- `` Tell you wot , '' said Dickey , `` there 's another five thousand due to-morrow on the surveyor 's report . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 28]: `` There is , '' said Verity , knowing that his guest and prospective partner alluded to the new steamer in course of construction on the Clyde .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 10]: `` Well , it wo n't be paid . ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 11]: David lifted his glass of port to hide his face .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 9]: Was this the first rumbling of the tempest ?
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 11]: Though expected hourly , he was not prepared for it .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 4]: His hand trembled .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 10]: He dared not put the wine to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 7]: `` Wot 's up now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 27]: `` You 're playin ' some underhand game on me , David , an ' I wo n't stand it , '' was the unhesitating reply .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 8]: `` You 're lyin ' about Iris .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 12]: You 've bin lyin ' ever since she disappeared from Bootle .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 18]: Show me ` er letters an ' their envelopes , an ' I 'll find the money .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 9]: But , of course , you ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 5]: They do n't exist .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 24]: Now , own up as man to man , an ' I 'll see if this affair can be settled without the lawyers .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 13]: You know wot it means once _ they _ take hold . ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 12]: Then David set down the untasted wine and told the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 11]: Not all -- that was not to be dreamed of .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 10]: In the depths of his heart he feared Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 10]: The old man 's repute for honesty was widespread .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 21]: He would fling his dearest friend into prison for such a swindle as that arranged between Coke and the shipowner .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 13]: But it was a positive relief to divulge everything that concerned Iris .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 25]: From his pocket-book David produced her frayed letter , and Bulmer read it slowly , aloud , through eyeglasses held at a long focus .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 19]: Now , given certain definite circumstances , an honest man and a rogue will always view them differently .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 18]: David had interpreted the girl 's guarded phrases in the light of his villainous compact with Coke .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 31]: Dickey , unaware of this disturbing element , was inwardly amazed to learn that Verity had lied so outrageously with the sole object of carrying through a commercial enterprise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 24]: ` Tell him I shall marry him when the _ Andromeda _ returns to England from South America , ' '' he read .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 31]: And again ... '' ` The vessel is due back at the end of September , I believe , so Mr. Bulmer will not have long to wait . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 53]: If , in the first instance , David had not been swept off his feet by the magnitude of the catastrophe , if he had not commenced the series of prevarications before the letter reached him , he might have adopted the only sane course and taken Bulmer fully into his confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 6]: It was too late now .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 4]: Explanation was useless .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 28]: The only plea that occurred to him was more deadly than silence , since it was her knowledge of the contemplated crime that made Iris a stowaway .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 17]: He had never guessed how that knowledge was attained and the added mystery intensified his torture .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 6]: Dickey rose from the table .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 8]: His movements showed his age that night .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 13]: `` I 'll think it over , David , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 11]: `` There 's more in this than meets the eye .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 11]: I 'll just go home an ' think it over .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 13]: Mebbe I 'll call at your place in the mornin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 16]: So here was Verity , awaiting Bulmer 's visit as a criminal awaits a hangman .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 23]: There was no shred of hope in his mind that his one-time crony would raise a finger to save him from bankruptcy .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 24]: Some offenses are unforgivable , and high in the list ranks the folly of separating a wealthy old man from his promised bride .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 17]: Now that a reprieve was seemingly impossible , he faced his misfortunes with a dour courage .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 18]: It had been a difficult and thankless task during the past month to stave off pressing creditors .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 20]: With Iris in Bootle and Bulmer her devoted slave , Verity would have weathered the gale with jaunty self-confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 24]: But that element of strength was lacking ; nay , more , he felt in his heart that it could never be replaced .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 35]: He was no longer the acute , blustering , effusive Verity , who in one summer 's afternoon had secured a rich partner and forced an impecunious sailor to throw away a worn-out ship .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 32]: The insurance held good , of course , and there simply _ must _ be some sort of tidings of the _ Andromeda _ to hand before the end of September .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 23]: Yet things had gone wrong , desperately wrong , and he was quaking with the belief that there was worse in store .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 7]: He began to read his letters .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 15]: They were mostly in the same vein , duns , more or less active .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 5]: His managing clerk entered .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 8]: `` There 's an offer of 5s .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 2]: 6d .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 14]: Cardiff to Bilbao and Bilbao to the Tyne for the _ Hellespont _ .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 6]: It is better than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 8]: Shall we take it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 11]: The _ Hellespont _ was the firm 's other ship .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 12]: She , too , was old and running at a loss .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 10]: Wot is it , coal or patent fuel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 11]: `` Coal , with a return freight of ore . ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 12]: `` Wish it was dynamite , with fuses laid on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 5]: The clerk grinned knowingly .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 12]: Men grow callous when money tilts the scale against human lives .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 24]: `` There 's no news of the _ Andromeda _ , and _ her _ rate is all right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 5]: David scowled at him .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 8]: `` D -- n the rate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 10]: `` I want to ` ear of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 9]: Wot the -- '' But his subordinate vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 7]: David read a few more letters .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 25]: Some were from the families of such of the _ Andromeda 's _ crew as lived in South Shields , the Hartlepools , Whitby .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 22]: They asked as a great favor that a telegram might be sent when -- `` Oh , curse my luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 28]: groaned the man , quivering under the conviction that the _ Andromeda _ was lost `` by the act of God '' as the charter-party puts it .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 5]: The belief unnerved him .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 12]: Those words have an ominous ring in the ears of evil-doers .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 22]: He could show a bold front to his fellowmen , but he squirmed under the dread conception of a supernatural vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 15]: So , like every other malefactor , David railed against his `` luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 17]: Little did he guess the extraordinary turn that his `` luck '' was about to take .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 26]: The office boy announced a visitor , evidently not the terrible Bulmer , since he said : `` Gennelman to see yer , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 6]: `` Oo is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 4]: growled the shipowner .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 9]: `` Gennelman from the noospaper , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 9]: `` Ca n't be bothered . '' '' '
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 10]: E sez hit 's most himportant , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 5]: `` Wot is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 7]: `` I dunno , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 8]: `` Well , show ` im in .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 8]: I 'll soon settle ` im . ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 6]: A quiet-mannered young man appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 17]: He ignored David 's sharp , `` Now , wot can I do for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 14]: and drew up a chair , on which he seated himself , uninvited .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 18]: `` May I ask if you have received any private news of the _ Andromeda _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 3]: he began .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 24]: `` In that case , you must prepare yourself for a statement that may give you a shock , '' said the journalist .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 7]: David creaked round in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 13]: His face , not so red as of yore , paled distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 6]: `` Is she lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 8]: said he in a strangely subdued tone .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 8]: `` I -- I fear she is .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 12]: But there is much more than an ordinary shipwreck at issue .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 12]: Several telegrams of the gravest import have reached us this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 15]: Perhaps , before I ask you any questions , you ought to read them .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 13]: They are in type already , and I have brought you proofs .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 6]: Here is the first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 15]: David took from the interviewer 's outstretched hand a long strip of white paper .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 24]: For an appreciable time his seething brain refused to comprehend the curiously black letters that grouped themselves into words on the limp sheet .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 29]: And , indeed , he was not to be blamed if he was dull of understanding , for this is what he read : `` REVOLUTION IN BRAZIL .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 4]: `` SERIOUS POSITION .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 8]: `` STARTLING ESCAPADE OF A BRITISH SHIP .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 8]: `` RIO DE JANEIRO , September 5th .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 30]: A situation of exceptional gravity has evidently arisen on the island of Fernando do Noronha , whence , it is said , ex-President De Sylva recently attempted to escape .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 13]: A battleship and two cruisers have been despatched thither under forced draught .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 55]: No public telegrams have been received from the island during the past week , and the authorities absolutely refuse any information as to earlier events , though the local press hints at some extraordinary developments not unconnected with the appearance off the island of a British steamship known as the _ Andromeda _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 28]: _ Later _ -- De Sylva landed last night at the small port of Maceio in the province of Alagoas , a hundred miles south of Pernambuco .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 16]: It is currently reported that Fernando Noronha was captured by a gang of British freebooters .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 7]: De Sylva 's return is unquestionable .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 17]: To-day he issued a proclamation , and his partisans have seized some portion of the railway .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 8]: Excitement here is at fever heat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 6]: Verity glared at the journalist .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 6]: He laughed , almost hysterically .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 7]: `` The _ Andromeda _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 4]: `` Wot rot !
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 5]: Wot silly rot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 19]: `` Better withhold your opinion until you have mastered the whole story , '' was the unemotional comment .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 8]: `` Here is a more detailed message .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 7]: It is printed exactly as cabled .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 21]: We have not added a syllable except the interpolation of such words as ` that ' and ` the . '
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 11]: You will find it somewhat convincing , I imagine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 7]: The shipowner grasped another printed slip .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 16]: This time he was able to read more lucidly : `` PERNAMBUCO , September 4th .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 32]: Public interest in the abortive attempt to reinstate Dom Corria De Sylva as President was waning rapidly when it was fanned into fresh activity by news that reached this port to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 8]: It appears that on the 31st ulto .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 37]: a daring effort was made to free De Sylva , who , with certain other ministers expelled by the successful revolution of two years ago , is a prisoner on the island of Fernando do Noronha .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 64]: Lloyd 's agent on that island reports that the British steamer _ Andromeda _ , owned by David Verity & Co. of Liverpool , put into South Bay , on the southeast side of Fernando do Noronha , early on the morning of August 31st , and it is alleged that her mission was to take De Sylva and his companions on board .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 49]: The garrison , forewarned by the central government , and already on the _ qui vive _ owing to the disappearance of their important prisoners from their usual quarters , opened fire on the _ Andromeda _ as soon as she revealed her purpose by lowering a boat .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 19]: `` The steamer , being unarmed , made no attempt to defend herself , and was speedily disabled .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 17]: She sank , within five minutes , off the Grand-p√®re rock , with all on board .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 33]: With reckless bravado , her commander ran up the vessel 's code signals and house flag while she was actually going down , thus establishing her identity beyond a shadow of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 39]: A note of pathos is added to the tragedy by the undoubted presence of a lady on board -- probably De Sylva 's daughter , though it was believed here that the ex-President 's family were in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 25]: Telegrams from the island are strictly censored , and the foregoing statement is unofficial , but your correspondent does not question its general accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 21]: Indeed , he has reason to credit a widespread rumor that the island is still in a very disturbed condition .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 13]: No one knows definitely whether or not De Sylva has been recaptured .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 55]: It is quite certain that he has not landed in Brazil , but the reticence of the authorities as to the state of affairs on Fernando Noronha leads to the assumption that he and a few stanch adherents are still in hiding in one of the many natural fastnesses with which the island abounds .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 21]: `` The British community on the littoral is deeply stirred by the drastic treatment received by the _ Andromeda _ .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 45]: It is pointed out that another ship , the _ Andros-y-Mela _ , believed to have been chartered by the insurgents , is under arrest at Bahia , and the similarity between the two names is regarded as singular , to say the least .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 54]: Were it not that Lloyd 's agent , whose veracity can not be questioned , has stated explicitly that the _ Andromeda _ put in to South Bay -- a point significantly far removed from the regular track of trading vessels -- it might be urged that a terrible mistake had been made .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 35]: In any event , the whole matter must be strictly inquired into , and one of His Majesty 's ships stationed in the South Atlantic should visit the island at the earliest date possible .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 7]: _ Delayed in transmission _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 13]: Something buzzed inside Verity 's head and stilled all sense of actuality .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 5]: He was unnaturally calm .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 18]: Though the weather was chilly for early September , great beads of perspiration glistened on his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 11]: His eyes were dull ; they lacked their wonted shiftiness .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 15]: He gazed at the reporter unblinkingly , as though thought itself refused to act .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 7]: `` Is that the lot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 4]: he inquired mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 7]: `` Nearly all , at present .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 19]: These cablegrams reached us through London , and the agency took the earliest measures to substantiate their accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 19]: The Brazilian Embassy pooh-poohs the whole story , but Embassies invariably do that until the news is stale .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 19]: By their own showing , Ambassadors are singularly ill-informed men , especially in matters affecting their own countries .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 17]: Here , however , is a short telegram from Paris which is of minor interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 11]: And Verity read again : `` PARIS , September 6th .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 40]: The members of Dom Corria De Sylva 's family , seen early this morning at the Hotel Continental , deny that any lady connected with the cause of Brazilian freedom took part in the attempted rescue of the ex-President .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 51]: They are much annoyed by the unfounded report , and hold strongly to the opinion that the revolution would now have been a _ fait accompli _ had not a traitor revealed the destination of the _ Andros-y-Mela _ and thus led to that vessel 's detention at Bahia . ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 3]: The lady !
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 3]: Iris Yorke !
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 12]: At last David 's supercharged mind was beginning to assimilate ideas .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 14]: He was conscious of a fierce pain in the region of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 21]: The buzzing in his head continued , and the journalist 's voice came to him as through a dense screen .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 26]: `` You will observe that the former President 's relatives tacitly admit that there was a plot on foot , '' the other was saying .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 32]: `` It is important to note , too , that the long message from Pernambuco , marked ` delayed in transmission ' seems to imply a prior telegram which was suppressed .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 12]: It alludes to a revolt of which nothing is known here .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 18]: Now , Mr. Verity , I want to ask you -- '' The door was flung open .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 13]: In rushed Dickey Bulmer with a speed strangely disproportionate to his years .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 9]: In his hands he held a crumpled newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 11]: `` You infernal blackguard , have you seen this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 18]: he roared , and his attitude threatened instant assault on the dazed man looking up at him .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 8]: The reporter moved out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 13]: Here , indeed , was `` copy '' of the right sort .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 9]: Bulmer held a position of much local importance .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 24]: That he should use such language to the owner of the _ Andromeda _ promised developments `` of the utmost public interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 4]: David stood up .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 8]: His chair fell over with a crash .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 10]: He held on to the table to steady himself .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 17]: Even Bulmer , white with rage , could not fail to see that he was stunned .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 12]: But Dickey was not minded to spare him on that account .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 8]: `` Answer me , you scoundrel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 12]: he shouted , thrusting the paper almost into David 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 11]: `` You are glib enough when it suits your purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 7]: Were _ you _ in this ?
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 25]: Is this the reason you did n't tell me Iris was on board till I forced the truth out of you last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 6]: The managing clerk came in .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 14]: Behind him , a couple of juniors and the office boy supplied re√´nforcements .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 32]: They all had the settled conviction that their employer was a rogue , but he paid them in no niggardly fashion , and they would not suffer anyone to attack him .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 13]: This incursion from the external world had a restorative effect on Verity .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 31]: Being what is termed a self-made man , he had a fine sense of his own importance , and his subordinates ' lack of respect forthwith overcame every other consideration .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 5]: `` Get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 10]: he growled , waving a hand toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 15]: `` But , sir -- please , gentlemen -- '' stuttered the senior clerk .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 8]: `` Get out , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 15]: D -- n yer eyes , ` oo sent for any of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 5]: Undoubtedly David was recovering .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 5]: The discomfited clerks retired .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 8]: Even Dickey Bulmer was quieted a little .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 11]: But he still shook the newspaper under David 's nose .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 4]: `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 6]: `` Let 's have it .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 9]: No more of your flamin ' made-up tales .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 17]: Wot took you to shove the _ Andromeda _ into a rat-trap of this sort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 7]: David staggered away from the table .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 9]: He seemed to be laboring for breath . ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 6]: ` Arf a mo ' .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 13]: No need to yowl at me like that , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 22]: He fumbled with the lock of a corner cupboard , opened it , and drew forth a decanter and some glasses .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 19]: A tumbler crashed to the floor , and the slight accident was another factor in clearing his wits .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 4]: He swore volubly .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 22]: `` Same thing ` appened that Sunday afternoon , '' he said , apparently obvious of the other men 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 10]: `` My poor lass upset one , she did .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 27]: Wish she 'd ha ' flung it at my ` ed ... Did it say ` went down with all ` ands , ' mister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 7]: he demanded suddenly of the reporter .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 7]: `` Yes , Mr. Verity . ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 6]: `` Is it true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 23]: `` I trust not , but Lloyd 's agent -- well , I need n't tell you that Lloyd 's is reliable .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 6]: Was your niece on board ?
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 10]: Is she the lady mentioned in the cablegram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 15]: Then Bulmer woke up to the fact that there was a stranger present . ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 4]: ` Ello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 4]: he cried angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 8]: `` Wot are you doin ' ere ?
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 5]: ` Oo are you ?
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 6]: Be off , instantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 33]: `` I am not going until Mr. Verity hears what I have to ask him , and answers , or not , as he feels disposed , '' was the firm reply .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 8]: `` Leave ` im alone , Dickey .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 5]: It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 14]: Wot does it matter now ` oo knows all there is to know ?
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 7]: Just gim me a minnit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 6]: Verity poured out some brandy .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 22]: Man is but a creature of habit , and the hospitable Lancastrian does not drink alone when there is company . ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 6]: ` Ave a tiddly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 4]: he inquired blandly .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 13]: Both Bulmer and the journalist believed that David was losing his faculties .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 43]: Never did shipowner behave more queerly when faced by a disaster of like magnitude , involving , as did the _ Andromeda 's _ loss , not only political issues of prime importance , but also the death of a near relative .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 13]: They refused the proffered refreshment , not without some show of indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 9]: Verity swallowed a large dose of neat spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 17]: He thought it would revive him , so , of course , the effect was instantaneous .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 36]: The same quantity of prussic acid could not have killed him more rapidly than the brandy rallied his scattered forces , and , not being a physiologist , he gave the brandy all the credit .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 21]: he said , smacking his lips with some of the old-time relish , `` that puts new life into one .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 13]: An ' now , let 's get on with the knittin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 26]: I was a bit rattled when this young party steers in an ' whacks ` is cock-an ' - bull yarn into me ` and .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 21]: ` Oo ever ` eard of a respectable British ship mixin ' ` erself up with a South American revolution ?
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 12]: The story is all moonshine on the face of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 25]: `` I think otherwise , Mr. Verity , and Mr. Bulmer , I take it , agrees with me , '' said the reporter .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 42]: `` Wot , '' blazed David , into whose mind had darted a notion that dazzled him by its daring , `` d'ye mean to insiniwate that I lent my ship to this ` ere Dom Wot 's - ` is-name ?
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 39]: D'ye sit there an ' tell me that Jimmie Coke , a skipper who 's bin in my employ for sixteen year , would carry on that sort of fool 's business behind ` is owner 's back ?
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 25]: Go into my clerk 's office , young man , an ' ax Andrews to show up a copy of the ship 's manifest .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 11]: See w ` en an ` ow she was insured .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 20]: Jot down the names of the freighters for this run , and skip round to their offices to verify .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 49]: An ' if that do n't fill the bill , well , just interview yourself , an ' say if you 'd allow your niece , a bonnie lass like my Iris , to take a trip that might end in ` er bein ' blown to bits .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 14]: It 's crool , that 's wot it is , reel crool . ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 8]: David was not simulating this contemptuous wrath .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 5]: He actually felt it .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 20]: His harsh voice cracked when he spoke of Iris , and the excited words gushed out in a torrent .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 38]: The reporter glanced at Bulmer , who was watching Verity with a tense expectancy that was not to be easily accounted for , since his manner and speech on entering the room had been so distinctly hostile .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 14]: `` The lady referred to was Miss Iris Yorke , then ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 4]: ` Oo else ?
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 8]: I 've on ' y one niece .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 17]: My trouble is that she went without my permission , in a way of speakin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 11]: ` Ere , you 'd better ` ave the fax .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 50]: She was engaged to my friend , Mr. Bulmer , but , bein ' a slip of a girl , an ' fond o ' romancin ' , she just put herself aboard the Andromeeda without sayin ' ` with your leave ' or ` by your leave . '
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 15]: She wrote me a letter , w ` ich sort of explains the affair .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 7]: D'you want to see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 6]: `` If I may . ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 28]: `` Yes , '' blustered Verity , fully alive now to the immense possibilities underlying the appearance in print of Iris 's references to her forthcoming marriage .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 20]: `` An ' I say ` no , ' an ' mean it , '' said the older man .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 9]: `` Go slow , David , go slow .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 21]: I was not comin ` ere as your enemy when I found this paper bein ' cried in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 8]: It med me mad for a while .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 47]: But I believe wot you 've said , an ' I 'm not the man to want my business , or my future wife 's I ` ope , to be chewed over by every Dick , Tom , an ' ` Arry in Liverpool . ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 26]: The reincarnation of David was a wonderful spectacle , the most impressive incident the journalist had ever witnessed , did he but know its genesis .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 9]: The metamorphosis was physical as well as mental .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 7]: Verity burgeoned before his very eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 18]: `` Of course , that makes a h -- a tremenjous difference , '' said the shipowner .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 18]: `` You ` ave my word for it , an ' that is enough for most men .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 11]: Mr. Andrews 'll give you all the information you want .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 28]: I 'll cable now to Rio an ' Pernambewco , an ' see if I can get any straight news from the shippin ' ` ouses there .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 22]: I 'll let you know if I ` ear anything , an ' you might do the same by me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 7]: The reporter gave this promise readily .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 15]: He scented a possible scandal , and meant to keep in touch with Verity .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 22]: Meanwhile , he was in need of the facts which the managing clerk could supply , so he took himself off .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 9]: Bulmer went to the window and looked out .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 11]: A drizzle of sleet was falling from a gray sky .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 5]: The atmosphere was heavy .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 27]: It was a day singularly appropriate to the evil tidings that had shocked him into a fury against the man who had so willfully deceived him .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 10]: David picked up the proof slips and reread them .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 28]: He compared them with the paragraphs in the newspaper brought by Bulmer , and thrown by him on the table after his first outburst of helpless wrath .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 35]: They were identical in wording , of course , but , somehow , their meaning was clearer in the printed page : and David , despite his uncouth diction , was a clever man .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 11]: He wrinkled his forehead now in analysis of each line .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 9]: Soon he hit on something that puzzled him .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 7]: `` Dickey , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 5]: There was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 21]: The old man peering through the window seemed to have bent and whitened even since he came into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 21]: `` Look ` ere , Dickey , '' went on David , `` this dashed fairy-tale wo n't hold water .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 6]: _ You _ know Coke .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 29]: Is ' e the kind o ' man to go bumpin ' round like a stage ` ero , an ' hoisting Union Jacks as the ship sinks ?
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 8]: I ax you , is ` e ?
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 9]: It 's nonsense , stuff an ' nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 36]: An ' , if the Andromeeda was scrapped at Fernando Noronha , ` oo were the freebooters that collared the island , an ' ` ow did this ` ere De Sylva get to Maceio ?
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 6]: Are you listenin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' said Bulmer , turning at last , and devouring Verity with his deep-set eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 10]: `` Well , wot d'ye think of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 11]: `` Did you send the ship to Fernando Noronha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 14]: It is needless to place on record the formula of David 's denial .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 13]: It was forcible , and served its purpose -- that should suffice .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 16]: `` Under ordinary conditions she would ` ave passed the island about the 31st ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 3]: continued Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 20]: Confound it , ` ave n't I bin cablin ' there every two days for a fortnight or more ?
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 23]: B'lieve me or not , Dickey , it cut me to the ` eart to keep you in the dark about Iris .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 18]: But I begun it , like an ijjit , an ' kep ' on with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 17]: `` To sweeten me on account of the new ships , I s ` pose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 7]: `` Yes , that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 7]: No more lyin ' for me .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 7]: I 'm sick of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 12]: `` For the same reason you wanted that letter published ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 5]: `` Well -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 9]: You see I 'm talkin ' straight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 16]: `` So am I. If -- if Iris is alive , the partnership goes on .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 11]: If -- she 's dead , it does n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 6]: `` D'ye mean it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 9]: `` I always mean wot I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 23]: The click of an indicator on the desk showed that Verity 's private telephone had been switched on from the general office .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 18]: By sheer force of routine , David picked up a receiver and placed it to his ear .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 22]: The sub-editor of the newspaper whose representative had not been gone five minutes asked if he was speaking to Mr. Verity .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said David , `` wot 's up now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 11]: and he motioned to Bulmer to use a second receiver .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 56]: `` A cablegram from Pernambuco states specifically that the captain and crew of the _ Andromeda _ fought their way across the island of Fernando Noronha , rescued Dom De Sylva , seized a steam launch , attacked and captured the German steamship _ Unser Fritz _ , and landed the insurgent leader at Maceio .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 25]: The message goes on to say that the captain 's name is Coke , and that he is accompanied by his daughter ... Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 5]: What did you say ?
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 6]: ... Are you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 22]: `` Yes , I 'm ` ere , or I think I am , '' said David with a desperate calmness .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 6]: `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 7]: `` All for the present . ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 24]: `` It does n't say that Coke is a ravin ' , tearin ' , ` owlin ' lunatic , does it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 6]: Is that your view ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 8]: Bulmer 's hand gripped David 's wrist .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 4]: Their eyes met .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 30]: `` I was thinkin ' that the chap who writes these penny novelette wires might ` ave rounded up his yarn in good shape , '' said Verity aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 21]: `` But there is not the slightest doubt that something of the kind has occurred , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 8]: `` It 's a put-up job ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 3]: roared David .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 28]: `` Them bloomin ' Portygees ` ave sunk my ship , an ' they 're whackin ' in their flam now so as to score first blow .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 16]: A year-old baby ` ud see that if ` is father was a lawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 4]: The sub-editor laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 20]: `` Well , I 'll ring you up again when the next message comes through , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 15]: But to Bulmer , David said savagely : `` Wot 's bitten Coke ? '
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 12]: E must ` ave gone stark , starin ' mad . ''
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 6]: `` Iris is alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 3]: murmured Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 26]: `` Nice mess she med of things w ` en she slung ` er ` ook from Linden ` Ouse , '' grunted her uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 8]: `` I do n't blame ` er .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 6]: She meant no ` arm .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 21]: She 's on ' y a bit of a lass , w ` en all is said an ' done .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 17]: Mebbe it 's my fault , or yours , or the fault of both of us .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 25]: An ' now , David , I 'll tell you wot I ` ad in me mind in comin ' ` ere this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 5]: You 're hard up .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 11]: You do n't know where to turn for a penny .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 27]: If you 're agreeable , I 'll put a trustworthy man in this office an ' give ` im full powers to pull your affairs straight .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 15]: Mind you , I 'm doin ' this for Iris , not for you .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 27]: An ' now that we know wot 's ` appening in South America , you an ' I will go out there and look into things .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 38]: A mail steamer will take us there in sixteen days , an ' before we sail we can work the cables a bit so as to stop Iris from startin ' for ` ome before we arrive .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 19]: The trip will do us good , an ' we 'll be away from the gossip of Bootle .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 4]: Are you game ?
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 11]: Well , gim me your ` and on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 32]: -LSB- Illustration : `` Well , gim me your ` and on it '' -RSB- CHAPTER XII THE LURE OF GOLD `` Philip , I want to tell you something . ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 5]: `` Something pleasant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 7]: `` Then why tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 10]: `` Because , unhappily , it must be told .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 14]: I hope you will forgive me , though I shall never forgive myself .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 14]: Oh , my dear , my dear , why did we ever meet ?
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 7]: And what am I to say ?
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 13]: I -- well , I have promised to marry another man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 4]: `` Disgraceful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 3]: said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 16]: Though Iris 's faltered confession might fairly be regarded as astounding , Philip was unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 26]: The German captain had given him a cigar , and he was examining it with a suspicion that was pardonable after the first few whiffs .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 32]: `` Philip dear , this is quite serious , '' said Iris , momentarily withdrawing her wistful gaze from the far-away line where sapphire sea and amber sky met in harmony .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 7]: Northeastern Brazil is a favored clime .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 38]: Bad weather is there a mere link , as it were , between unbroken weeks of brilliant sunshine , when nature lolls in the warmth and stirs herself only at night under the moon and the stars .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 43]: That dingy trader , the _ Unser Fritz _ , ostensibly carrying wool and guano from the Argentine to Hamburg , was now swinging west at less than half speed over the long rollers which alone bore testimony to the recent gale .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 23]: Already a deep tint of crimson haze over the western horizon was eloquent , in nature 's speech , of land ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 21]: At her present pace , the _ Unser Fritz _ would enter the harbor at Pernambuco on the following morning .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 38]: Iris , her troubled face resting on her hands , her elbows propped on the rails of the poop on the port side , looked at Philip with an intense sadness that was seemingly lost on him .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 11]: His doubts concerning the cigar had grown into a certainty .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 7]: He cast it into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 35]: `` I really mean what I say , '' she continued in a low voice that vibrated with emotion , for her obvious distress was enhanced by his evident belief that she was jesting .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 17]: `` I have given my word -- written it -- entered into a most solemn obligation .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 32]: Somehow , the prospect of reaching a civilized place to-morrow induces a more ordered state of mind than has been possible since -- since the _ Andromeda _ was lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 6]: `` Who is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 4]: demanded Hozier darkly .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 5]: `` Coke is married .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 4]: So is Watts .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 14]: Dom Corria has other fish to fry than to dream of committing bigamy .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 33]: Of course , I am well aware that you have been flirting outrageously with San Benavides -- '' `` Please do n't make my duty harder for me , '' pleaded Iris .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 41]: `` Before I met you , before we spoke to each other that first day at Liverpool , I had promised to marry Mr. Bulmer , an old friend of my uncle 's -- '' `` Oh , -- he ?
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 19]: ... I am sorry for Mr. Bulmer , but it ca n't be done , '' interrupted Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 8]: `` Philip , you do not understand .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 50]: I -- I cared for nobody then ... and my uncle said he was in danger of bankruptcy ... and Mr. Bulmer undertook to help him if I would consent ... '' `` Yes , '' agreed Philip , with an air of pleasant detachment , `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 7]: You are in a first-rate fix .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 7]: I was always prepared for that .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 14]: Coke told me about Bulmer -- warned me off , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 28]: I forgot his claims at odd times , just for a minute or so , but he is a real bugbear -- a sort of matrimonial bogey-man .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 36]: If all goes well , and we enter Pernambuco without being fired at , you will be handed over to the British Consul , and he will send a rousing telegram about you to England .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 13]: Bulmer , of course , will cause a rare stir at home .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 4]: Who would n't ?
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 6]: No wonder you are scared !
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 17]: It seems to me that there is only one safe line of action left open . ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 8]: Iris did not respond to his raillery .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 26]: She was despondent , nervous , uncertain of her own strength , afraid of the hurricane of publicity that would shortly swoop down on her .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 31]: `` I wish you would realize how I feel in this matter , '' she said , with a persistence that was at least creditable to her honesty of purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 18]: `` A woman 's word should be held as sacred as a man 's , Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 7]: He turned and met her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 9]: There was a tender smile on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 15]: `` So you really believe you will be compelled to marry Mr. Bulmer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 9]: `` Oh , do n't be horrid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 4]: she almost sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 12]: `` I cuc -- cuc -- ca n't help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 41]: `` I have given some thought to the problem myself , '' he said , for , in truth , he was beginning to be alarmed by her tenacity , though determined not to let her perceive his changed mood .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 28]: `` Curiously enough , I was thinking more of your dilemma than of the signals when we were overhauled by the _ Sao Geronimo _ this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 19]: Odd , is n't it , how things pop into one 's mind at the most unexpected moments ?
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 54]: While I was coding our explanation that we were putting into Pernambuco for repairs , and that no steam yacht had been sighted between here and the River Plate , I was really trying to imagine what the cruiser 's people would have said if I had told them the actual truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 17]: His apparent gravity drew the girl 's thoughts for an instant from contemplating her own unhappiness .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 9]: `` How could you have done that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 13]: `` We are going there to suit Senhor De Sylva 's ends .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 18]: We have suffered so much already for his sake that we could hardly betray him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 12]: Hozier spread wide his hands with a fine affectation of amazement .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 13]: `` I was n't talking about De Sylva , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 13]: `` My remarks were strictly confined to the question of your marriage .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 26]: I know you far too well , Iris , to permit you to go back to Bootle to be lectured and browbeaten by your uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 19]: I have never seen him , but , from all accounts , he is a rather remarkable person .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 15]: He likes to have his own way , irrespective of other folks ' feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 8]: I am a good guesser , Iris .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 22]: I have a pretty fair notion why Coke meant to leave our poor ship 's bones on a South American reef .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 24]: I appreciate exactly how well it would serve Mr. David Verity 's interests if his niece married a wealthy old party like Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 9]: By the way how old is Bulmer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 5]: `` Nearly seventy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 16]: Even Iris herself smiled then , though her tremulous mirth threatened to dissolve in tears .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 12]: `` Ah , that 's a pity , '' said Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 18]: `` It is very unkind of you to treat me in this manner , '' she protested .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 9]: `` But I am trying to help you .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 27]: I say it is a pity that Bulmer should be a patriarch , because his only hope of marrying you is that I shall die first .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 11]: Even then he must be prepared to espouse my widow .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 14]: By the way , is it disrespectful to describe him as a patriarch ?
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 13]: Is n't there some proverb about three score years and ten ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 17]: `` Philip , if only you would appreciate my dreadful position -- '' `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 6]: It ought to be ended .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 9]: The first parson we meet shall be commandeered .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 15]: Do n't you see , dear , we really must get married at Pernambuco ?
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 26]: That is what I wanted to signal to the cruiser : ` The _ Unser Fritz _ is taking a happy couple to church . '
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 9]: Would n't that have been a surprise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 8]: Iris clenched her little hands in despair .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 8]: Why did he not understand her misery ?
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 37]: Though she was unwavering in her resolution to keep faith with the man who had twitted her with taking all and giving nothing in return , she could not wholly restrain the tumult in her veins .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 4]: Married in Pernambuco !
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 8]: Ah , if only that were possible !
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 16]: Yet she did not flinch from the lover-like scrutiny with which Philip now favored her .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 34]: `` I am sure we would be happy together , '' she said , with a pathetic confidence that tempted him strongly to take her in his arms and kiss away her fears .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 26]: `` But we must be brave , Philip dear , brave in the peaceful hours as in those which call for another sort of courage .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 9]: Last night we lived in a different world .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 27]: We looked at death , you and I together , not once but many times , and you , at least , kept him at bay .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 5]: But that is past .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 9]: To-day we are going back to the commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 11]: We must forget what happened in the land of dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 20]: I will never love any man but you , Philip ; yet -- I can not marry you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 10]: `` You will marry me -- in Pernambuco . ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 9]: `` I will not because I may not .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 9]: Oh , spare me any more of this !
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 6]: I can not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 6]: Have pity , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 13]: `` Iris , let us at least look at the position calmly .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 25]: Do you really think that fate 's own decree should be set aside merely to keep David Verity out of the Bankruptcy Court ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 19]: `` I have given my promise , and those two men are certain I will keep it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 8]: `` Ah , they shall release you .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 4]: What then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 12]: `` You do not know my uncle , or Mr. Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 5]: Money is their god .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 10]: They would tell you that money can control fate .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 22]: We , you and I , might despise their creed , but how am I to shirk the claims of gratitude ?
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 7]: I owe everything to my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 10]: He rescued my mother and me from dire poverty .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 8]: He gave us freely of his abundance .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 13]: Would you have me fail him now that he seeks my aid ?
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 4]: Ah , me !
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 11]: If only I had never come on this mad voyage !
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 11]: But it is too late to think of that now .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 41]: Perhaps -- if I had not promised -- I might steel my heart against him -- but , Philip , you would never think highly of me again if I were so ready to rend the hand that fed me .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 8]: We have had our hour , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 7]: Its memory will never leave me .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 30]: I shall think of you , dream of you , when , it may be , some other girl -- oh , no , I do not mean that !
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 10]: Philip , do n't be angry with me to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 7]: You are wringing my heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 47]: It was in Hozier 's mind to scoff in no measured terms at the absurd theory that he should renounce his oft-won bride because a pair of elderly gentlemen in Bootle had made a bargain in which she was staked against so many bags of gold .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 40]: But pity for her suffering joined forces with a fine certainty that fortune would not play such a scurvy trick as to rob him of his divinity after leading him through an Inferno to the very gate of Paradise .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 12]: For that is how he regarded the perils of Fernando Noronha .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 13]: He was young , and the ethics of youth cling to romance .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 24]: It seemed only right and just that he should have been proved worthy of Iris ere he gained the heaven of her love .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 26]: There might be portals yet unseen , with guardian furies waiting to entrap him , and he would brave them all for her dear sake .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 26]: But his very soul rebelled against the notion that he had become her chosen knight merely to gratify the unholy ardor of some decrepit millionaire .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 18]: He laughed savagely at the fantasy , and his protest burst into words strange on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 16]: `` I shall never give you up to any other man , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 22]: `` I have won you by the sword , and , please God , I shall keep you against all claimants .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 30]: Twenty-two men sailed out of Liverpool on board the Andromeda , and it was given to me among the twenty-two that I should pluck you from darkness into light .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 34]: I had only seen you that day on the wharf , yet I was thinking of you constantly , little dreaming that you were within a few yards of me all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 25]: I was planning some means of meeting you again when our surly-tempered skipper bade me burst in the door that kept you from me .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 40]: And that is what I have been doing ever since , Iris -- breaking down barriers , smashing them , whether they were flesh and blood or nature 's own obstacles , so that I might not lose you .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 4]: Give you up !
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 5]: Not while I live !
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 23]: Why , you yourself dragged me away from certain death when I was lying unconscious on the _ Andromeda 's _ deck .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 44]: A second time , you saved not me alone but the ten others who are left out of the twenty-two , by bringing us back to Grand-p√®re in the hour that our escape seemed to be assured had we put out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 18]: We are more than quits , dear heart , when we strike a balance of mutual service .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 14]: We are bound by a tie of comradeship that is denied to most .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 6]: And who shall sever it ?
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 21]: The man who gains three times the worth of his ship by reason of the very dangers we have shared !
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 11]: To state such a mad proposition is to answer it .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 14]: Who is he that he should sunder those whom God has joined together ?
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 23]: And what other man and woman now breathing can lay better claim than we to have been joined by the Almighty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 25]: The strange exigencies of their lives during the past two days had ordained that this should be Philip 's first avowal of his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 21]: Under the stress of overpowering impulse he had clasped Iris to his heart when they were parting on the island .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 28]: In obedience to a stronger law than any hitherto revealed to her innocent consciousness the girl had flown to his arms when he came to the hut .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 30]: And that was all their love-making , two blissful moments of delirium wrenched from a time of a gaunt tragedy , and followed by a few hours of self-negation .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 26]: Yet they sufficed -- to the man -- and the woman is never too ready to count the cost when her heart declares its passion .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 9]: But the morrow was not to be denied .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 6]: Its bitter awakening had come .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 31]: In the very agony of a sublime withdrawal Iris realized what manner of man this was whom she had determined to thrust aside so that she might keep her troth .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 7]: She dared not look at him .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 17]: She could not compel her quivering lips to frame a word of excuse or reiterated resolve .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 30]: With a heart-breaking cry of sheer anguish she fled from him , running away along the deck with the uncertain steps of some sorely stricken creature of the wild .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 8]: He did not try to restrain her .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 40]: Heedless of the perplexed scowl with which Coke was watching him from the bridge , he looked after her until she vanished in the cabin which had been vacated for her use by the chief engineer of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 21]: Even her manifest distress gave him a sense of riotous joy that was hardly distinguishable from the keenest spiritual suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 6]: `` Give you up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 4]: he muttered again .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 22]: `` No , Iris , not if Satan brought every dead Verity to aid the living one in his demand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 22]: Coke , to whom tact was anathema , chose that unhappy instant to summon him to take charge of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 18]: The German master and crew had not caused trouble to their conquerors after the first short struggle .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 37]: They washed their hands of responsibility , professed to be satisfied with the written indemnity and promise of reward given by De Sylva , and otherwise placed the resources of the vessel entirely at his disposal .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 9]: A more peaceable set of men never existed .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 26]: Though they numbered sixteen , three more than the usurpers , it was quite certain that the thought of further resistance never entered their minds .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 11]: If anything , they hailed the adventure with decorous hilarity .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 13]: It formed a welcome break in the monotony of their drab lives .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 23]: Of course , they were utterly incredulous as to the ability of a scarecrow like Dom Corria to fulfil his financial pledges .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 4]: Therein they erred .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 49]: He was really a very rich man , having followed the illustrious example set by generations of South American Presidents in accumulating a fine collection of gilt-edged scrip during his tenure of office , which said scrip was safely lodged in London , Paris , and New York .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 43]: But the world always refuses to associate rags with affluence , and these worthy Teutons regarded De Sylva and Coke as the leaders of a gang of dangerous lunatics who should be humored in every possible way until a port was reached .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 38]: It was precisely that question of a port which had engaged Coke in earnest consultation with De Sylva and San Benavides on the bridge while Iris and Hozier were lacerating each other 's feelings on the poop .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 12]: Apparently , the point was settled when Hozier joined the triumvirate .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 38]: Coke glanced at the compass , and placed the engine-room telegraph at `` Full Speed Ahead , '' for the _ Unser Fritz _ had once been a British ship , and still retained her English appliances .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 16]: `` Keep ` er edgin ' south a bit , '' said he to Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 31]: `` There 's no knowin ' w ` en that crimson cruiser will show up again , but we must try and steal a knot or two afore sundown . ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 11]: The order roused Hozier from his stupor of wrathful bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 5]: `` Why south ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 13]: `` If anything , Pernambuco lies north of our present course . ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 9]: `` We 're givin ' Pernambuco the go-by .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 14]: It 's Maceio for us , quick as we can get there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 9]: Hozier was in no humor for conciliatory methods .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 19]: He turned on his heel , and walked straight to where De Sylva was leaning against the rails .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 32]: `` Captain Coke tells me that we are not making for Pernambuco , '' he said , meeting the older man 's penetrating gaze with a glance as firm and self-contained .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 13]: `` That is what we have arranged , '' said Dom Corria .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 31]: `` It does not seem to have occurred to you that there is one person on board this ship whose interests are vastly more important than yours , senhor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 6]: `` Meaning Miss Yorke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 26]: asked the other , who did not require to look twice at this stern-visaged man to grasp the futility of any words but the plainest .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 11]: `` She will be safer at Maceio than at Pernambuco .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 16]: Our only danger at either place will be encountered at the actual moment of landing .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 15]: At Maceio there is practically no risk of finding a warship in the harbor .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 9]: That is why we are going there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 14]: `` And not because you are more likely to find adherents there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 22]: `` It is a much smaller town than Pernambuco , and my strength lies outside the large cities , I admit .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 25]: But there can be no question as to our wisdom in preferring Maceio , even where the young lady 's well-being is concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 5]: `` I think differently .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 11]: At Maceio there are few , if any , Europeans .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 18]: At Pernambuco the large English-speaking community will protect her , no matter what President is in power .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 9]: I must ask you to reconsider your plan .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 22]: Land Miss Yorke and me at Pernambuco , and then betake yourself and those who follow you where you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 8]: Coke jerked himself into the dispute . ''
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 9]: ` Ere , wot 's wrong now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 4]: he demanded angrily .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 19]: `` Since w ` en ` as a second officer begun to fix the ship 's course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 18]: `` I am not your second officer , nor are you my commander , '' said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 27]: `` At present we are fellow-pirates , or , at best , running the gravest risk of being regarded as pirates by any court of law .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 25]: I do n't care a cent personally what port we make , but I do care most emphatically for Miss Yorke 's safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 22]: `` We 've argied the pros an ' cons , an ' it 's to be Maceio , '' growled Coke .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 17]: Dom Corria 's precise tones broke in on what threatened to develop into a serious dispute .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 32]: `` You would have been asked to join in the discussion , if , apparently , you were not better engaged at the moment , Mr. Hozier , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 32]: `` I assure you , on my honor , that there are many reasons in favor of Maceio even from the exclusive point of view of Miss Yorke 's immediate future .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 7]: She will be well cared for .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 9]: I promise to make that my first consideration .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 18]: The army is mainly for me , and Senhor San Benavides 's regiment is stationed at Maceio .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 29]: The navy , on the other hand , supports Dom Miguel Barraca , who supplanted me , and we shall surely meet a cruiser or gunboat at Pernambuco .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 36]: You see , therefore , that common prudence -- '' `` I see that , whether willing or not , we are to be made the tools of your ambition , '' interrupted Hozier curtly .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 28]: `` It is also fairly evident that I am the only man of the _ Andromeda 's _ company whom you have not bribed to obey you .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 8]: Well , be warned now by me .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 30]: If circumstances fail to justify your change of route , I shall make it my business to settle at least one revolution in Brazil by cracking your skull . ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 24]: San Benavides , hearing the names of the two ports , understood exactly why the young Englishman was making such a strenuous protest .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 18]: He moved nearer , laying an ostentatious hand on the sword that clanked everlastingly at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 28]: He had never been taught , it seemed , that a man who can use his fists commands a readier weapon than a sword in its scabbard .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 4]: Hozier eyed him .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 8]: There was no love lost between them .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 16]: For a fraction of a second San Benavides was in a position of real peril .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 17]: Then Dom Corria said coldly : `` No interference , I pray you , Senhor Adjudante .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 4]: Kindly withdraw . ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 6]: His tone was eminently official .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 7]: San Benavides saluted and stepped back .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 37]: The dark scar on De Sylva 's forehead had grown a shade lighter , but there was no other visible sign of anger in his face , and his luminous eyes peered steadily into Hozier 's .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 6]: `` Let me understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 15]: `` You hold my life as forfeit if any mischance befalls Miss Yorke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 5]: `` I accept that .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 13]: Of course , you no longer challenge my direction of affairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 30]: `` I am no match for you in argument , senhor , but I do want you to believe that I shall keep my part of the compact . ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 62]: Coke , familiar with De Sylva 's resources as a debater , and by no means unwilling to see Hozier `` taken down a peg , '' as he phrased it ; eager , too , to witness the Brazilian officer 's discomfiture if the second mate `` handed it to him , '' thought it was time to assert himself .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 15]: `` I 'm goin ' to ` ave a nap , '' he announced .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 10]: `` Either you or Watts must take ` old .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 7]: W'ich is it to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 18]: `` No need to ask Mr. Hozier any such question , '' said the suave Dom Corria .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 7]: `` You can trust him implicitly .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 10]: He is with us now -- to the death .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 10]: Captain San Benavides , a word with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 10]: `` South a bit , '' repeated the skipper .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 12]: `` Call me at two bells in the second dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 20]: He was turning to leave the bridge with the Brazilians when a cheery voice came from a gangway beneath .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 14]: `` Yah , yah , mine frent -- that 's the proper lubricant .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 14]: I would n't give you tuppence a dozen for your bloomin ' lager .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 6]: Well , just a freshener .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 2]: Thanks .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 5]: Ik danky shun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 12]: `` You spik Tcherman vare goot , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 8]: `` Talk a little of all sorts .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 8]: Used to sing a Jarman song once .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 11]: What was that you was a-hummin ' in your cabin ?
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 3]: Nice chune .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 8]: I 've a musical ear meself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 13]: Someone sang a verse in a subdued baritone , tremulous with sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 23]: The melody was haunting , the words almost pathetic under the conditions of life on board the disheveled _ Unser Fritz _ .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 12]: They told of Vienna , the city beloved of its sons .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 13]: Es gibt nur eine Kaiser Stadt , Es gibt nur eine Wien .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 7]: `` Shake , me boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 10]: cried the enraptured Watts to the ship 's captain .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 17]: `` I do 'n' know wot it 's all about , but it 's reel fine .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 10]: Something to do with a gal , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 22]: Well , ` ere 's one of the same kidney : I know a maiden fair to see , Take care !
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 12]: She can both false and friendly be , Beware , beware !
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 10]: Trust her not , She is fooling thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 21]: Mr. Watts was both charmed and surprised when the friendly skipper joined in the concluding lines in his own language .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 6]: But his pleasure was short-lived .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 10]: Coke 's inflamed visage glowered into the mess room .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 11]: `` Sink me if you ai n't a daisy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 12]: he roared , pouncing on a three-quarters filled bottle of rum .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 16]: `` D'you fancy we 're goin ' to land you at Maceio cryin ' drunk ?
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 8]: No , sir , not this time .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 20]: Over it goes , an ' if you ai n't dam careful , over you go after it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 12]: Watts could have wept without the artificial stimulus of the rum .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 25]: To see good liquor slung into the sea in that fashion -- well , it was a sin , that 's wot it was !
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 14]: But Coke 's furious eye quelled him ; and revel and song ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 25]: Above , on the bridge , Hozier smiled sourly at the squall which had so suddenly beset the fair argosy of the convivial-minded Watts .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 12]: He tried to invest the incident with an excess of humor .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 16]: Any excuse would serve to still certain disquieting doubts that were springing into alarming activity .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 15]: Had he gone the best way to work in allaying Iris 's conscience-stricken qualms ?
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 13]: Was he justified in adopting such a bold line with De Sylva ?
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 17]: Could it be possible -- no , he refused to harbor any mean thought of Iris .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 40]: She loved him , he was sure ; his love for her was at once a torment and an excruciating bliss , and both of these wearing sensations sadly detracted from the efficiency of the officer of the watch .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 30]: So our distracted Philip pulled himself up sharply , paced back and forth between port and starboard , and surveyed ship , binnacle , and horizon with alert vigilance .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 15]: On the fore-deck groups of sailors and firemen belonging to both vessels were fraternizing .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 16]: There could be little room for speculation as to the subject of their broken talk .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 24]: It was of De Sylva , of Brazil 's new dictator , of the gold he would control when he became President again .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 18]: The slow-moving Teutonic mind was beginning to assimilate the notion that there was money in this escapade .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 54]: That the tatterdemalion then closeted with the _ Unser Fritz 's _ captain could obtain a certified check for a million sterling , and twenty-five times as many millions of francs , and even then remain a man of means , was unbelievable ; but if he regained power , that was different .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 8]: _ Ende gut , alles gut _ .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 7]: There might be pickings in it .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 6]: Soon after sunset Iris reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 25]: She walked on the after deck with San Benavides , and seemed to be listening with great attention to something he was telling her .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 35]: Hozier was often compelled to look that way in order to make certain that the _ Sao Geronimo _ was not overhauling the ship in one of her circling flights over the wide channel .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 37]: He wondered what in the world San Benavides was saying that his chatter should be so interesting , and he acknowledged with a pang that Iris was deliberately avoiding his own occasional glances in her direction .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 55]: There is no saying what would have happened had he known that the Brazilian was relating the scene that took place on the bridge , suppressing its prime motive , and twisting it greatly to Hozier 's detriment , though with an adroit touch that deprived Iris of any power to resent his words .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 33]: Indeed , she read her own meaning into Philip 's anxiety to reach Pernambuco , whereas San Benavides was striving to instill the belief that she would find excellent friends at Maceio .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 26]: She was far too loyal-hearted to suspect Philip of a hidden purpose in urging that the voyage should end in one port rather than another .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 16]: But she could not forget that he said repeatedly they would be married in Pernambuco .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 19]: Indeed , the promise had a glamour of its own , even though it could never be fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 37]: More than once her cheeks glowed with a rush of color that San Benavides attributed to his own delightful personality , and , when she paled again , his voice sank to a deeply sympathetic note .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 24]: And here came Watts , rejuvenated , having imbibed many pints of the despised lager , and humming gaily : Beware , Beware !
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 4]: Trust her not !
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 5]: She is foo-oo-ooling thee !
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 4]: Confound the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 12]: Why could he not chant the piratical doggerel that Coke abhorred ?
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 14]: That , at least , would have been more appropriate to present surroundings ?
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 4]: But would it ?
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 8]: Ah , Philip felt a twinge then .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 4]: `` Touch√© ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 10]: chortled some unseen imp who plied a venomous rapier .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 26]: Thank goodness , a sailor was standing by the ship 's bell , with his hand on a bit of cord tied to the clapper .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 7]: It would soon be seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 14]: Even the companionship of the uncouth skipper was preferable to this brooding solitariness .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 29]: When Hozier was relieved , and summoned to a meal in the saloon with Norrie and some of the ship 's own officers , Iris was nowhere visible .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 10]: He went straight to her cabin , and knocked .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 6]: `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 5]: `` I , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 13]: Will you be on deck in a quarter of an hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 16]: `` But this time _ I _ want to tell _ you _ something . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 9]: `` Philip , dear , I am weary .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 13]: I must rest -- and -- I dare not meet you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 5]: `` Dare not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 7]: `` I am afraid of myself .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 5]: Please leave me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 19]: He caught the sob in her voice , and it unmanned him ; he stalked off , raging .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 31]: He remembered how the fiend , in Gounod 's incomparable opera , whispered in the lover 's ear : `` Thou fool , wait for night and the moon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 10]: and he was wroth with himself for the memory .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 20]: While off duty he kept strict watch and ward over the gangway in which Iris 's cabin was situated .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 8]: It was useless ; she remained hidden .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 28]: The _ Unser Fritz _ was now heading southwest , and `` reeling off her ten knots an hour like clockwork , '' as Norrie put it .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 23]: The Recife , that enormous barrier reef which blockades hundreds of miles of the Brazilian coast , caused no anxiety to Coke .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 27]: He was well acquainted with these waters , and he held on stoutly until the occulting light of Maceio showed low over the sea straight ahead .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 35]: It was then after midnight , and the land was still ten miles distant , but the ship promptly resumed her role of lame duck , lest a prowling gunboat met and interrogated her .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 25]: As Coke had told Iris she might expect to be ashore about two o'clock , she waited until half-past one ere coming on deck .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 27]: Despite her unalterable decision to abide by the hideous compact entered into with her uncle and Bulmer , her first thought now was to find Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 29]: Though the sky was radiant with stars , a slight haze on the surface of the sea shrouded the ship 's decks and passages in an uncanny darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 24]: Coke 's orders forbade the display of any lights whatsoever , except those in the engine-room and the three essential lamps carried externally .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 41]: So the _ Unser Fritz _ was gloomy , and the plash of the sea against her worn plates had an ominous sound , while the glittering white eye of the lighthouse winked evilly across the black plain in front .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 40]: In a word Iris was thoroughly wretched , and not a little disturbed by the near prospect of landing in a foreign country , which would probably be plunged into civil war by the mere advent of De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 25]: It need hardly be said that , under these circumstances , Hozier was the one man in whose company she would feel reasonably safe .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 8]: But she could not see him anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 26]: Coke and Watts , with the Brazilians and a couple of Germans , were on the bridge , but Hozier was not to be found .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 19]: At last she hailed one of the _ Andromeda 's _ men whom she met in a gangway .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 7]: `` Mr. Hozier , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 18]: `` Oh , he 's forrard , right up in the bows , keepin ' a lookout .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 20]: This is a ticklish place to enter without a pilot , an ' we 've passed two already . ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 7]: This information added to her distress .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 8]: She ought not to go to him .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 15]: Full well she knew that her presence might distract him from an all-important task .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 53]: So she sat forlornly on the fore-hatch , waiting there until he might leave his post , reviewing all the bizarre procession of events since she climbed an elm-tree in the garden of Linden House on a Sunday afternoon now so remote that it seemed to be the very beginning of life .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 20]: The adventures to which that elm-tree conducted her were oddly reminiscent of the story of Jack and the Beanstalk .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 10]: For once , the true had outrivaled the fabulous .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 36]: The steamer crept on lazily , and Iris fancied the hour must be nearer five o'clock than two when she heard Hozier 's voice ring out clearly : `` Buoy on the port bow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 12]: There was a movement among the dim figures on the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 15]: A minute later Hozier cried again : `` Buoy on the starboard bow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 11]: She understood then that they were in a marked channel .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 6]: Already the road was narrowing .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 6]: Soon they would be ashore .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 5]: At last Hozier came .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 12]: He saw her as he jumped down from the forecastle deck .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 9]: `` Why are you here , Iris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 5]: was all he said .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 26]: She looked so bowed , so humbled , that he could not find it in his heart to reproach her for having avoided him earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 12]: `` I wanted to be near you , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 9]: `` I -- I am frightened , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 7]: I am terrified by the unknown .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 10]: Somehow , on the rock our dangers were measurable .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 16]: Here , we shall soon be swallowed up among a whole lot of people . ''
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 17]: They heard Coke 's gruff order to the watch to clear the falls of the jolly-boat .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 10]: The _ Unser Fritz _ was going dead slow .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 21]: On the starboard side were the lights of a large town , but the opposite shore was somber and vague .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 15]: `` Are we going to land at once , in a small boat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 4]: said Iris timidly .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 11]: `` I fancy there is a new move on foot .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 10]: A gunboat is moored half a mile down stream .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 9]: You missed her because your back was turned .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 14]: She has steam up , and could slip her cables in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 45]: They saw her from the bridge , of course , but I did not report her , as there was a chance that my hail might be heard , and we came in so confidently that we are looked on as a local trader .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 9]: Come , let us buy a programme . ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 22]: He took her by the arm with that masterful gentleness that is so comforting to a woman when danger is rife .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 13]: Even his jesting allusion to their theatrical arrival in port was cheering .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 5]: They reached the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 11]: Some sailors were lowering a boat as quietly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 7]: Dom Corria approached with outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 10]: `` Good-by , Miss Yorke , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 13]: `` I am leaving you for a few hours , not longer .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 22]: When next we meet I ought to have a sure grip of the Presidential ladder , and I shall climb quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 8]: Wo n't you wish me luck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 15]: `` I wish you all good fortune , Dom Corria , '' said Iris .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 9]: `` May your plans succeed without bloodshed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 10]: `` Ah , this is South America , remember .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 8]: Our conflicts are usually short and fierce .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 8]: _ Au revoir _ , Mr. Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 9]: By daybreak we shall be better friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 18]: San Benavides also bade them farewell , with an easy grace not wholly devoid of melodramatic pathos .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 29]: The dandy and the man of rags climbed down a rope ladder , the boat fell away from the ship 's side , and the night took them .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 16]: `` What did he mean by saying you would be ` better friends ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 4]: whispered the girl .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 6]: `` Have you quarreled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 19]: `` We had a small dispute as to the wisdom of landing you here , '' said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 6]: `` Perhaps I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 15]: He is a clever man , and he surely knows his own country . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 5]: `` Mr. Hozier ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 3]: cried Coke .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 11]: `` Is all clear forrard to let go anchor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 5]: `` Give her thirty .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 11]: You go and see to it , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 7]: Hozier made off at a run .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 10]: Iris recalled the last time she heard similar words .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 3]: She shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 35]: Would that placid foreshore blaze out into a roar of artillery , and the worn-out _ Unser Fritz _ , like the worn-out _ Andromeda _ , stagger and lurch into a watery grave .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 18]: But the only noise that jarred the peaceful night was the rattle of the cable and winch .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 12]: The ship fell away a few feet , and was held .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 9]: There was no moving light on the river .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 12]: Not even a police boat or Customs launch had put off .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 16]: Maceio was asleep ; it was quite unprepared for the honor of a Presidential visit .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 62]: CHAPTER XIII THE NEW ERA A swaggering officer and a man habited like a beggar landed unobserved at a coal wharf , moored a ship 's boat to a bolt , and passed swiftly through a silent town till they reached the closed gates of an infantry barrack perched on a hill that rose steeply above the clustering roofs of Maceio .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 19]: Though the seeming mendicant limped slightly , his superior stature enabled him to keep pace with the officer .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 7]: The pair neither lagged nor hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 14]: The officer knocked loudly on a small door inset in the big gates .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 7]: After some delay it was opened .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 4]: A sentry challenged .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 17]: `` Capit√£o San Benavides , '' announced the officer , and the man stood to attention .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 15]: `` Enter , my friend , '' said San Benavides to his ragged companion .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 37]: The latter stepped within ; the wicket was locked , and the click of the bolt was suggestive of the rattle of the dice with which Dom Corria De Sylva was throwing a main with fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 28]: Perhaps some thought of the kind occurred to him , but he was calm as if he were so poor that he had naught more to lose .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 10]: `` Who is the officer of the guard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 6]: San Benavides asked the soldier .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 14]: `` Senhor Tenente -LSB- Lieutenant -RSB- Regis de Pereira , senhor capit√£o . ''
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 26]: `` Tell him , with my compliments , that I shall be glad to meet him at the colonel 's quarters in fifteen minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 10]: The queerly-assorted pair moved off across the barrack square .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 6]: The sentry looked after them .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 14]: `` My excellent captain seems to have been brawling , '' he grinned .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 10]: `` But what of the _ mendigo _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 4]: What , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 15]: A most pertinent question for Brazil , and one that would be loudly answered .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 14]: The colonel 's house was in darkness , yet San Benavides rapped imperatively .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 6]: An upper window was raised .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 9]: A voice was heard , using profane language .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 4]: A head appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 10]: Its owner cried , `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 4]: -- with additions .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 5]: `` San Benavides . ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 3]: `` Christo !
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 5]: And the other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 7]: `` One whom you expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 5]: The head popped in .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 10]: Soon there was a light on the ground floor .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 4]: The door opened .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 21]: A very stout man , barefooted , who had struggled into a pair of abnormally tight riding-breeches , faced them .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 7]: `` Can it be possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 7]: he exclaimed , striking an attitude .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 7]: Dom Corria spoke not a word .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 13]: He knew the value of effect , and could bide his time .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 8]: The three passed into a lighted apartment .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 29]: De Sylva placed himself under a chandelier , and took off a frayed straw hat which he had borrowed from someone on board the _ Unser Fritz _ .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 18]: The colonel , a grotesque figure in his present _ deshabill√© _ , bowed low before him .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 4]: `` My President !
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 9]: -- I salute you , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 14]: `` Thank you , General , '' said Dom Corria , smiling graciously .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 9]: `` I knew I could depend on you .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 9]: How soon can you muster the regiment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 9]: `` In half an hour , Excellency . ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 13]: `` See that there is plenty of ammunition for the machine guns .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 6]: What of the artillery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 14]: `` The three batteries stationed here are with us heart and soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 17]: `` Colonel San Benavides , as chief of the staff , is acquainted with every detail .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 13]: You , General , will assume command of the Army of Liberation .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 13]: Some trunks were sent to you from Paris , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 12]: `` They are in the room prepared for your Excellency . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 12]: `` Let me go there at once and change my clothing .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 15]: I must appear before the troops as their President , not as a jail-bird .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 12]: For the moment I leave everything to you and San Benavides .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 6]: Let Senhor Pondillo be summoned .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 10]: He will attend to the civil side of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 18]: You have my unqualified approval of the military scheme drawn up by you and my other friends .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 12]: There is one thing -- a gunboat lies in the harbor .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 8]: Is she the _ Andorinha _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 30]: The newly-promoted general smote his huge stomach with both hands -- `` beating the drum , '' he called it -- and the rat-tat signified instant readiness for action .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 13]: `` The guns will soon scare that bird , '' he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 18]: As _ Andorinha _ means `` swallow '' in English there was some point to the remark .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 8]: Nor was he making a vain boast .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 31]: The most astounding feature of every revolution in a South American republic is the alacrity with which the army will fire on the navy , _ et vice vers√¢ _ .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 10]: The two services seem to be everlastingly at feud .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 21]: If politicians fail to engineer a quarrel , the soldiers and sailors will indulge in one on their own account .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 7]: It was so now at Maceio .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 23]: Dawn was about to peep up over the sea when twelve guns lumbered through the narrow streets , waking many startled citizens .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 22]: A few daring souls , who guessed what had happened , rushed off on horseback or bicycle to remote telegraph offices .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 6]: These adventurers were too late .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 14]: Every railway station and post-office within twenty miles was already held by troops .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 8]: Revolts are conducted scientifically in that region .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 34]: Their stage management is perfect , and the cumbrous methods of effete civilizations might well take note of the speed , thoroughness , and efficiency with which a change of government is effected .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 18]: For instance , what could be more admirable than the scaring of the bird by General Russo ?
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 33]: He drew up his three batteries on the wharf opposite the unsuspecting _ Andorinha _ , and endeavored to plant twelve shells in the locality of her engine-room without the least hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 17]: There was no thought of demanding her surrender , or any quixotic nonsense of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 56]: In the first place , no man would act as herald , since he would be shot or stabbed the instant his errand became known ; in the second , as Hozier had explained to Iris , the gunboat could slip her cable very quickly , and Russo 's artillerists might miss a moving object .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 15]: As it was , every gun scored , though the elevation was rather high .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 16]: The shells made a sad mess of the superstructure , but left the engines intact .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 13]: The sailors , on their part , knew exactly what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 17]: Every man who escaped death or serious injury from the bursting missiles ran to his post .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 24]: A wire hawser and mooring rope were severed with axes , the screw revolved , and the _ Andorinha _ was in motion .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 8]: Though winged , she still could fly .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 20]: The second salvo of projectiles was less damaging ; again the gunners failed to reach the warship 's vitals .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 20]: Her commander got his own armament into action , and managed to demolish a warehouse and a grain elevator .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 12]: Then he made off down the coast toward Rio de Janeiro .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 10]: The sudden uproar stirred Maceio from roof to basement .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 7]: Its inhabitants poured into the Plaza .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 15]: Every man vied with his neighbor in yelling : `` The revolution is here !
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 6]: _ Viva Dom Corria _ !
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 7]: _ Abajo S√£o Paulo _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 8]: That last cry explained a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 16]: The State of S√£o Paulo had long maintained a `` corner '' in Brazilian Presidents .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 17]: De Sylva , a native of Alagoas , was the first to break down the monopoly .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 35]: Hence the cabal against him ; hence , too , the readiness of Maceio , together with many of the smaller ports and the whole of the vast interior , to espouse his cause .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 50]: For the purposes of this story , which is mainly concerned with the lives and fortunes of a few insignificant people unknown to history , it is not necessary to follow in detail the trumpetings , proclamations , carousals , and arrests that followed Dom Corria 's first success .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 21]: It is a truism that in events of international importance the very names of the chief actors ofttimes go unrecorded .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 16]: Future generations will ask , perhaps : -- Who blew up the _ Maine _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 12]: Who persuaded the Tsar to break his word anent Port Arthur ?
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 17]: Who told Paul Kruger that the Continent of Europe would support the Boers against Great Britain ?
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 16]: Such instances could be multiplied indefinitely , and the rule held good now in Brazil .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 58]: If any polite Pernambucano , Maceio-ite , or merchant of Bahia were informed that President De Sylva 's raid was alone rendered possible by the help of a truculent British master-mariner and a dozen or so of his hard-bitten crew , he -LRB- the said Brasileiro -RRB- might be skeptical , or , at best , indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 41]: But let the name of some puppet politician hailing from S√£o Paulo be mentioned , and his eyes would flash with angry recognition ; yet the _ Andromeda 's _ small contingent achieved more than a whole army of conspirators .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 48]: The one incident , then , of a political nature , in which the victors of the tussle on Fernando Noronha were publicly concerned , was the outcome of a message cabled by Dom Corria while the smoke of Russo 's cannon still clung about the quay .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 40]: It was written in German , addressed to a Hamburg shipping firm , and ran as follows : `` Have sold _ Unser Fritz _ to Senhor Pondillo of this port as from September 1st , for 175,000 marks .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 16]: If approved , cable confirmation , and draw on Paris branch Deutsche Bank at sight .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 10]: Franz Schmidt , care German Consul , Maceio . ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 20]: This harmless commercial item was read by many officials hostile to De Sylva , yet it evoked no comment .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 14]: Its first real effect was observable in the counting-house of the Hamburg owners .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 22]: There it was believed that Captain Schmidt had either become a lunatic himself or was in touch with a rich one .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 15]: Schmidt was so well known to them that they acted on the latter hypothesis .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 23]: They cabled him their hearty commendation , `` drew '' on the Paris bank by the next post , and awaited developments .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 10]: To their profound amazement , the money was paid .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 24]: As they had obtained 8,750 pounds for a vessel worth about one-quarter of the sum , they had good reason to be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 24]: It mattered not a jot to them that the sale was made `` as from September 1st , '' or any other date .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 50]: They signed the desired quittance , cabled Schmidt again to ask if Senhor Pondillo was in need of other ships of the _ Unser Fritz _ class , and the members of the firm indulged that evening in the best dinner that the tip-top restaurant of Hamburg could supply .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 31]: They were puzzled next day by certain statements in the newspapers , and were called on to explain to a number of journalists that the ship had left their ownership .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 5]: She was at Maceio .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 4]: Where was Maceio ?
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 6]: Somewhere in South America . ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 17]: _ Es ist nicht von Bedeutung _ , '' said the senior partner to his associates .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 20]: `` Schmidt will write full particulars ; when all is said and done , we have the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 12]: Yet it did matter very greatly , as shall be seen .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 21]: Here , again , was an instance of an humble individual becoming a cog in the wheel of world politics .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 15]: Within less than a month Schmidt was vituperated by half the chancelleries of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 7]: A newspaper war raged over him .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 11]: He became the object of an Emperor 's Jovian wrath .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter with Schmidt ?
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 8]: He 's -- all -- right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 9]: thundered the whole press of the United States .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 14]: And all because he had made a good bargain at a critical moment !
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 29]: But no one on board the _ Unser Fritz _ was vexed by aught save present tribulations when De Sylva and his _ aide _ quitted the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 10]: Be sure that not a soul thought of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 24]: Every man , and the one woman whom chance had thrown in their midst , remained on deck and watched the slumbering town .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 7]: It was only a small place .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 21]: The _ Andorinha _ lay at one end of the harbor , the _ Unser Fritz _ at the other .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 19]: They were barely half a mile apart , and Maceio climbed the sloping shore between the two points .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 50]: Hozier , of course , had forgiven Iris for her aloofness , and Iris , with that delightful inconsistency which ranks high among the many charms of her sex , found that `` Philip dear , '' though she might not marry him , was her only possible companion .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 18]: He , having acquired an experience previously lacking , took care to fall in with her mood .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 20]: She , weary of a painful self-repression , cheated the frowning gods of `` just this one night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 43]: So they looked at the twinkling lights , spoke in whispers lest they should miss any tokens of disturbance on shore , elbowed each other comfortably on the rails of the bridge , and uttered no word of love or future purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 44]: They were discussing nothing more important than the sufferings of Watts -- whom Coke would not allow to go out of his sight -- when a lightning blaze leaped from the somber shadows of some buildings on the quay lower down the river .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 19]: Again , and many times again , the sudden jets of flame started out across the black water .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 62]: Iris , or Hozier , for that matter , had never seen a field-piece fired by night , but before the girl could do other than grip Philip 's arm in a spasm of fear , the thunder of the artillery rolled across the harbor , and the worn plates of the _ Unser Fritz _ quivered under the mere concussion .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 10]: `` By jove , they 're at it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 3]: cried Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 8]: Iris felt the thrill that shook him .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 20]: She could not see his face , but she knew that his blue eyes were shining like bright steel .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 21]: She was horrified at the thought of red war being so near , yet she was proud of her lover .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 13]: At these mortal crises , the woman demands courage in the man .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 10]: she gasped , and clung to him more tightly .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 32]: Under such circumstances it was only to be expected that his arm would clasp her round the waist ; Disraeli 's famous epigram was coined for diplomacy , not for love-making .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 20]: Hozier strained his eyes through the gloom to try and discover the effect of the cannonade on the gunboat .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 12]: He was quickly alive to the significance of the answering broadside .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 9]: Then the black hull grew dim and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 10]: His sailor 's sympathies went with the escaping ship .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 6]: `` She has got away !
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 11]: I am jolly glad of it , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 15]: `` It was a dirty trick to open fire on her in that fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 26]: Just how they served the _ Andromeda _ , the hounds , only we had never a gun to tickle them up in return . ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 15]: `` Do you think that many of the poor creatures have been killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 4]: asked Iris tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 15]: The din of ordnance and bursting shells had ceased as suddenly as it began .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 7]: Lights appeared in nearly every house .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 9]: Shouting men were running along the neighboring wharf .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 43]: Maceio , never a heavy sleeper in bulk , dreamed for a second of earthquakes , leaped out of bed , and ran into the streets in the negligent costume which the Italians describe by the delightful word , _ confidenza _ .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 12]: `` I do n't suppose so , '' Hozier reassured her .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 21]: `` If the artillery had made good practice at that short range the gunboat must have sunk at her moorings .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 9]: Her men naturally could n't miss the town .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 13]: There was a rare old rattle among the crockery behind the soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 5]: Did you hear it ?
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 7]: I wonder what went over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 11]: He was as excited as a schoolboy , almost jubilant .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 3]: Poor Iris !
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 26]: Though she was now a veteran in scenes of death and disaster , she realized that fate had erred in choosing her as a heroine .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 6]: Coke and Watts drew near .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 19]: `` Dom Wot 's - ` is-name was n't long in gettin ' busy , '' chuckled Coke .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 16]: `` Gev ' her a dose of the _ Andromeda 's _ physic , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 12]: I 'm sorry the blighters managed to ` ook it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 22]: Though he had just uttered an opinion directly contrary to his captain 's , Hozier deemed it wise to be non-committal .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 13]: `` The guns must have been laid badly , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 27]: `` Mebbe , an ' wot 's more , d -- n 'em , they knew there was something in front that could shoot back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 7]: So Coke was at least impartial .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 22]: He cared not a jot how the Brazilians slaughtered each other so long as De Sylva established the new regime speedily .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 15]: `` I never was a fightin ' man meself , '' murmured Watts weakly .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 16]: `` That sort of thing gives me a sinkin ' sensation in me innards . ''
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 15]: `` Wot you want is a drink , me boy , '' said Coke .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 3]: Watts brightened .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 6]: He drew a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 16]: `` I reelly believe that 's wot 's wrong with me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 22]: `` Then I 'll just ax the cook to ` urry up with the corfee , '' guffawed the unfeeling skipper .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 17]: `` We 'll all be the better for a snack an ' somethink ` ot . ''
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 9]: Iris managed to choke down an hysterical laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 17]: Coke was incorrigible , yet she was conscious of a growing appreciation of his crude chivalry .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 11]: He boasted truly that he feared neither man nor devil .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 12]: His chief defect lay in being born several centuries too late .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 16]: Had he flourished during the Middle Ages , Coke would have carved out a kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 29]: Even while the men were thus callously discussing the tragedy that had been enacted before their eyes , the miracle of the dawn was transforming night into day .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 10]: In the tropics there is no hesitancy about sunrise .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 9]: The splendid imagery of Genesis is literally exact .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 21]: `` Let there be light ; and there was light ... and God divided the light from the darkness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 21]: Long before the _ Andorinha _ had crept round the southern headland of the Macayo estuary she became visible again .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 16]: About six o'clock a grand review was held in the Plaza , or chief square .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 14]: Dom Corria , a resplendent personage on horseback , made a fine speech .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 11]: He was vociferously applauded , by both troops and populace .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 15]: General Russo , also mounted , assured him that Brazil was pining for him .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 22]: In effect , when he was firmly established in the Presidency , the people would be allowed to vote for him .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 27]: `` We have borne two years of misrule , '' vociferated the commander-in-chief , `` but it has vanished before the fiery breath of our guns .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 8]: We hail your Excellency as our liberator .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 5]: Long live Dom Corria !
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 31]: Down with -- '' The fierce `` Vivas '' of the mob , combined with the general 's weight , proved too much for his charger , which plunged violently .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 9]: Russo was held on accidentally by his spurs .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 27]: There was a lively interlude until an orderly seized the bridle , and the general was able to disengage the rowels from the animal 's ribs .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 24]: When tranquillity was restored , the soldiers marched off to their quarters , and Colonel San Benavides boarded the _ Unser Fritz _ .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 20]: He invited Iris , Schmidt , Coke , and Hozier to breakfast with the President at the principal hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 10]: Watts was not included in the list of guests .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 8]: Being indignant , he expressed himself freely .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 5]: `` Nice thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 5]: he said to Norrie .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 10]: `` We 're not good enough to be axed .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 40]: It was a bit of all right w ` en we ` elped ` im out of quod , but now ` e 's a bloomin ' toff we 're low-down sailormen -- that 's wot we are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 13]: `` Man , ye 're fair daft , '' growled the Scot .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 43]: `` It 's as plain as the neb on yer face that he canna dae wi ' a ' , so he just picked the twa skippers and the lassie ; he kent weel she wadna stir an inch withoot Hozier . ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 20]: Norrie was right , as it happened , but Watts added another grudge to his score against De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 26]: Now , though dynasties totter and empires crash , the first thing a woman thinks of when bidden to a public gathering is her attire .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 48]: Iris declared most emphatically that to expect her to go ashore and meet certain military and civic dignitaries while she was wearing a costume originally purchased for mountaineering , which had endured the rough usage of the past two days , was `` for to laugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 14]: She was speaking French , and that was the literal phrase she used .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 9]: The courteous San Benavides smiled away her protest .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 7]: His Excellency had foreseen the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 15]: Those who knew Dom Corria best would not credit that he should forget anything .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 15]: The Senhora Pondillo awaited Iris at the hotel with a supply of new clothing .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 35]: Captain Schmidt , of course , could depend on his own wardrobe , but Captain Coke and the Senhor Hozier would find a tradesman in their rooms who had guaranteed to equip them suitably .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 32]: Moreover , the same outfitter would visit the ship during the morning and make good the lost raiment and boots of the other officers and men of the _ Andromeda _ .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 29]: San Benavides spoke like the ambassador of a prince , and , in the sequel , there was no stint of deeds to give effect to his promises .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 20]: On the way to the hotel Iris saw a large building labeled `` Casa do Correio e Telegraphia . ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 18]: It was not surprising that she had not thought earlier of the necessity of cabling to Liverpool .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 9]: She blushed , and looked involuntarily at Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 14]: `` I must send a message to my uncle , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 37]: Were Philip a professed spiritualist , the spectral shapes of David Verity and Dickey Bulmer could not have been more effectually `` projected '' into his astral plane at Maceio than they were at that instant .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 28]: He had not set eyes on either of the men , but the girl 's words conjured them into being , and the vision was vastly disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 19]: San Benavides , of course , was anxious to oblige Iris in this as in every other respect .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 43]: He procured the requisite form , told her the cost , which led to a condensed version of the original draft , smoothed away the slight hindrance of foreign money tendered in payment , and arranged the due delivery of a reply .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 11]: Perhaps he smiled when he read what she had written .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 19]: The words were comprehensible even to one who did not understand English : '' _ Andromeda _ lost .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 4]: Arrived here safely .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 7]: Address , Yorke , Maceio . ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 23]: There was a space at the foot of the form on which it was necessary to subscribe her name and local address .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 18]: So she wrote , `` Iris Yorke , steamship _ Unser Fritz _ , Maceio harbor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 13]: Hozier was standing by her side as she printed the words legibly .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 17]: She looked up at him with a curiously tense expression that he did not fathom immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 15]: They were in the busy main street again ere its meaning occurred to him .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 6]: The cable committed her irrevocably .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 10]: She felt that she was signing her own condemnation !
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 28]: Among the four people , therefore , who entered the Hotel Grande in the Rua do Sul there were two whose feelings were the reverse of cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 22]: But convention is stronger than the primal impulses -- sometimes it triumphs over death itself -- and convention was all-powerful now .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 39]: It led Iris away captive in the train of the smiling and voluble Senhora Pondillo , and it immersed Hozier in a tangle of fearsome words which turned out to be the stock in trade of a clothier .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 11]: The mere male of Maceio decks himself with gay plumage .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 26]: Philip was hard put to it before he secured some garments which did not irresistibly recall the heroes of certain musical comedies popular in England .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 5]: Coke experienced worse vicissitudes .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 35]: Even the variety and richness of a master mariner 's vocabulary was taxed to its utmost resources when he was coaxed into `` trying on '' a short jacket apparently intended for a toreador .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 11]: Such minor troubles , however , were overcome in time .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 46]: A razor and a hot bath were by no means the least important items of the rejuvenating process , and when the two men entered the salon where Dom Corria was holding an impromptu reception they looked like a couple of coffee-planters from the Argentine .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 5]: Schmidt was there already .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 29]: For some reason , the new President seemed to be so fond of the _ Unser Fritz 's _ commander that he refused to be parted from him .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 16]: It was not until long afterward that Hozier discovered the reason of this mushroom friendship .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 8]: The German consul was in the room .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 11]: The appearance of Iris caused something akin to a sensation .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 38]: The Dona Pondillo could not create English clothes , nor bad copies of French , but her own daughters dressed in the height of local fashion , and Dom Corria 's earnest request had made them generous .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 28]: The dark-eyed , olive-complexioned women of Alagoas are often exceedingly beautiful , but few of those present had ever seen a brown-haired , brown-eyed , fair-faced Englishwoman .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 17]: Iris was remarkably good-looking , even among the pretty girls of her own county of Lancashire .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 30]: Her large , limpid eyes , well-molded nose , and perfectly formed mouth were the dominant features of a face that had all the charm of youth and health .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 29]: Her smooth skin , brown with exposure to sun and air , glowed into a rich crimson when she found herself in the midst of so many strangers .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 37]: The slightly delicate semblance induced by the hardships and loss of rest which fell to her lot since the _ Andromeda _ went to pieces on the Grand-p√®re rock in no wise detracted from her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 14]: She wore the elegant costume of a Maceio belle with ease and distinction .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 26]: If she was flurried by the undisguised murmur of admiration that greeted her , she did not show it beyond the first rush of color .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 13]: Dom Corria , dragging Schmidt with him , hurried to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 22]: Surprise at his gala attire helped to conquer her natural timidity , for the President was gorgeous in blue and gold .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 16]: `` My good wishes are soon changed into congratulations , Senhor , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 25]: `` Ah , my dear young lady , I am overjoyed that you should be here to witness my success , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 48]: Then , as if he had waited for this moment , he turned to the assembled company and delivered an eloquent panegyric of the _ Andromeda 's _ crew and their _ deusa deliciosa _ -- for that is what he called Iris -- a delightful goddess .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 17]: He had made many speeches already that day , but none was more heartfelt than this .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 5]: His eulogy was unstinted .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 24]: Luckily for Iris , she was so conscious of the attention she attracted that she kept her eyes steadfastly fixed on the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 21]: Otherwise , having a well-developed sense of humor , she must have laughed outright had she seen Coke 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 12]: He , of course , understood no word that was said .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 12]: But De Sylva 's animated gestures and flashing eyes were enough .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 29]: Ever and anon , the excitable citizens of Maceio would turn and gaze at one or other of the three , while loud cries of `` Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 6]: punctuated the President 's oratory .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 21]: When Coke 's turn came for these demonstrations , he tried to grin , but was only able to scowl .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 10]: For once in his stormy life he was nonplused .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 9]: His brick-red countenance glowed with heat and embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 28]: At the close of the speech he muttered to Hozier : `` Wish I 'd ha ' known wot sort of beano I was comin ' to .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 9]: Dam if I ai n't meltin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 8]: This ordeal ended , d√©jeuner was served .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 10]: The President took in Iris and the Dona Pondillo .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 7]: They were the only ladies present .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 22]: The three sailors , some staff officers , and a few local celebrities , made up the rest of the company .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 44]: Hozier , though by no means indifferent to the good fare provided , was wondering how many hours would elapse before Iris 's cablegram reached Verity 's office , when some words caught his ear that drove all other considerations from his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 34]: `` I am sorry to say that , in my opinion , there is not the slightest chance of your message reaching England to-day , Miss Yorke , '' the President was saying .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 6]: `` But why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 15]: she asked , with an astonishment that was not wholly the outcome of regret .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 26]: `` The cable does not land here , and the transmitting stations will be closely watched , now that my arrival in Brazil is known .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 14]: Even the simplest form of words will be twisted into a political significance .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 11]: No , I think it best to be quite candid .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 28]: Until I control Pernambuco , which should be within a week or ten days , you may rest assured that no private cablegrams will be forwarded . ''
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 38]: `` Oh , dear , I fully expected a reply to-day , '' she said , and now that she realized the effect of a further period of anxiety on the Bootle partnership she was genuinely dismayed .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 15]: `` You may be sure it will not come , '' said Dom Corria .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 41]: `` Indeed I may as well take this opportunity of explaining to you -- and to my other English friends '' -- with the interpolated sentence his glance dwelt quietly on Hozier and Coke -- `` the exact position locally .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 16]: You see , Maceio is a small place , and easily approached from the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 34]: A hostile fleet could knock it to pieces in half an hour , and it would be a poor reward for my supporters ' loyalty if my presence subjected them to a bombardment .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 26]: I have no strong defenses or heavy guns to defy attack , and my troops are not more than a thousand men , all told .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 11]: It is obvious that I must make for the interior .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 36]: There , I gather strength as I advance , the warships can not pursue , and I can choose my own positions to meet the half-hearted forces that Dom Miguel will collect to oppose me .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 16]: In fact , I and every armed man in Maceio march up-country this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 45]: Iris , by this time , was thoroughly frightened , and Hozier , who read more in De Sylva 's words than was possible in her case , was watching the speaker 's calm face with a fixity that might have disconcerted many men .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 18]: Dom Corria seemed to be unaware of either the girl 's distress or Philip 's white anger .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 23]: `` You naturally ask how I propose to safeguard the companions of my flight from Fernando Noronha , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 12]: `` I answer at once -- by taking them with me .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 19]: The Senhora Pondillo and her family will accompany her husband to my _ quinta _ at Las Flores .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 16]: A special train will take all of us to the nearest railway station this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 10]: Thence my estate is but a day 's march .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 20]: You and my other friends from both ships will be quite safe and happy there until order is restored .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 4]: You must come .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 41]: The men 's lives , at any rate , would not be worth an hour 's purchase if my opponent 's forces found them here , and I feel certain that one or more cruisers will arrive off Maceio to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 35]: For you , this excursion will be quite a pleasant experience , and you can absolutely rely on my promise to send news of your safety to England at the very first opportunity . ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 11]: Iris could say nothing under the shock of this intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 10]: She looked at Philip , and their eyes met .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 12]: They both remembered the glance they had exchanged at the post-office .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 46]: Preoccupied by their own thoughts , neither of them had noticed the smile San Benavides indulged in on that occasion , nor did they pay heed to the fact that he was smiling again now , apparently at some story told him by General Russo .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 6]: But San Benavides was sharp-witted .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 24]: He needed no interpreter to make clear the cause of the chill that had fallen on the President 's end of the table .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 12]: `` He has told them , '' he thought , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 49]: And , if further surmise were hazarded as to his views , they might well prove to be concerned with the wonderful things that can happen within a week or ten days -- especially when things are happening at the rate taken by events just then in Brazil .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 35]: Of course , as a philosopher , San Benavides was right ; it was in the role of prophet that he came to grief , this being the pre-ordained fate of all false prophets .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 27]: CHAPTER XIV CARMELA Among the many words borrowed by the Brazilians from their Spanish-speaking neighbors , that for `` to-morrow '' is perhaps the most popular .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 26]: The Spaniard 's _ Ma√±ana _ is so elastic that it covers any period of time between the next twenty-four hours and the indefinite future .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 39]: When , therefore , Dom Sylva spoke of controlling Pernambuco before the month of September was barely half sped , he was either too sanguine , or too literal in his translation of easy-going Portuguese into vigorous English .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 20]: His _ quinta _ , or country house , was situated on the upper watershed of the river Moxoto .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 41]: There he raised his standard , thither flocked rebels galore , and in that direction , with due caution , President Barraca pushed columns of troops by road and rail from Bahia , from Pernambuco , and from Maceio itself .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 35]: For Barraca held the sea , and the wealthy and enterprising south was strongly opposed to war , while Dom Corria trusted to the mountains and drew his partisans from the less energetic north .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 39]: This bald statement has an unconvincing sound in the ears of races which dwell north of the equator , but it must be remembered that Brazil , in more respects than one , is the land of topsy-turveydom .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 45]: Were it not that the mass of the people was heartily sick of a corrupt regime , De Sylva would have been dead or in irons on his way back to Fernando Noronha well within the time allotted for the consolidation of his rule .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 65]: As it was , minor insurrections were breaking out in the southern provinces , the reigning President could trust only in the navy , and the conservatism of commerce and society , as represented by the great landowners of Rio de Janeiro , S√£o Paulo , and Minas Geraes , alone stifled the upgrowth of an overwhelming national movement in Dom Corria 's favor .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 26]: In a word , De Sylva commanded public sympathy but small resources ; Barraca was unpopular but controlled the navy and part of the army .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 44]: Given such conditions -- with the added absurdity that the troops on both sides were most unwilling to face long-range rifle fire but would cheerfully hack each other to mince-meat with knives -- and a tedious , indeterminate campaign is the certain outcome .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 15]: De Sylva had said that local conflicts were usually `` short and fierce . ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 21]: Applied to such upheavals as had taken place in the capital during recent years , the phrase was strictly accurate .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 17]: He himself had been bundled out of office between Mass and Vespers on a memorable Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 19]: But a convict on a remote island can not organize such a perfect example of a successful revolt .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 20]: He had done much in gaining a good foothold ; the rest must be left to time and chance .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 27]: A few indecisive but sanguinary engagements were fought in the neighborhood of Pesqueira , a town in the hills about one hundred miles from the seaboard .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 19]: These proved that General Russo was a valiant fighter but a poor tactician -- and that was all .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 15]: He was opposed by a commander of little courage but singular skill in strategy .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 30]: To restore the balance , Dom Corria took the field in person , and Dom Miguel Barraca hastened from Rio de Janeiro to witness the crushing of his arch-enemy .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 21]: The position was complicated by the arrival at Pernambuco of a German squadron bearing a telegraphic cartel from the Emperor .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 11]: A German ship had been seized on the high seas .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 4]: And by whom ?
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 6]: And how could anybody dare ?
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 54]: Then Brazil quivered , for every South American knows in his heart that the great navy of Germany is being created not so much to destroy England as to dispute the proud doctrine of the United States that no European power shall ever again be allowed to seize territory on the American continent .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 46]: So there were strenuous days and anxious nights at Las Flores , where President De Sylva sought to equip and discipline his levies , and at Carugru , where President Barraca called on all the gods to witness that De Sylva was a double-dyed traitor .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 63]: Under such circumstances it is not surprising that a grand display of money and audacity , backed by sundry distant roars of the British lion , should enable two elderly Britons and a young Brazilian lady to pass through the lines of the Exercito Nacional , as Barraca had christened his following , in opposition to De Sylva 's army of Liberation .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 19]: Lest too many people should become interested , the adventure was essayed on the night of October 2d .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 13]: Early next day the travelers and their guides reached the rebel outposts .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 33]: The young lady , who seemed to be at home in this wild country , at once urged her horse into a pace wholly beyond the equestrian powers of her staid companions .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 4]: They protested vainly .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 26]: She waved a farewell hand , cantered over several miles of a rough road , and dashed up to the Liberationist headquarters about eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 8]: There was no hesitancy about her movements .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 19]: She drew rein in approved Gaucho style , bringing her mount to a dead stop from a gallop .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 7]: `` Where is the President ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 4]: she asked breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 30]: `` There , senhora , '' said an orderly , pointing to a marquee , open on every side , wherein De Sylva sat in conference with his staff .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 34]: So many officers and mounted soldiers were coming and going , so great was the bustle of preparation for some important movement then in train , that no one specially noted her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 20]: She dismounted , and drew the reins across the horse 's head ere she tied him to a tree .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 48]: She saw a tall young man emerge from the tent , jump on a charger held by a soldier , and ride off at a fast pace toward the house of Las Flores , which stood in a large garden on the slope of a neighboring hill .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 8]: His appearance seemed to puzzle her momentarily .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 19]: His attire was that of Brazil , but neither his manner nor horsemanship was typical of the Brasileiro .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 57]: In walking , he moved with an air of purposeful concentration that differed singularly from the languorous stroll of the average Brazilian officer , while his seat in the saddle , though confident enough , could not be mistaken for that of a man who never walks a yard if there is an animal to bestride .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 26]: The new arrival was , however , at once too weary and too excited to give further heed to one who was an utter stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 39]: She pushed her way through knots of smoking loungers , entered the tent , and uttered a little scream of delight when the President , who was writing at a big table , happened to glance at her .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 24]: De Sylva rose hastily , with an amazed look on his usually unemotional face ; forthwith the girl flung herself into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 4]: `` Father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 4]: `` Carmela ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 19]: San Benavides , whose back was turned , heard the joyous cries of the reunited father and daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 25]: They were locked in each other 's embrace , and the eyes of every man present were drawn to a pathetic and unexpected meeting .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 35]: For that reason , and because none gave a thought to him , the pallor that changed the bronze of his forehead and cheeks into a particularly unhealthy-looking tint of olive green passed unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 4]: He swallowed something .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 14]: It must have been a curse , for it seemed to taste bitter .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 50]: But he managed to recover some shred of self-control ere the Senhora De Sylva was able to answer her father 's first eager questions ; then , with a charming timidity , she found breath to say : `` And what of Salvador -- is he not here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 17]: Yes , Salvador was there -- by her side -- striving most desperately to look lover-like .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 4]: They clasped hands .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 30]: Brazilian etiquette forbade a more demonstrative greeting , and Carmela attributed Salvador 's manifest sallowness to the hardships of campaigning no less than the shock of her sudden appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 37]: But the business of red war gave little scope for the many confidences that a girl who had journeyed more than four thousand miles for this reunion might naturally exchange with a father and a lover .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 18]: Some important move was toward , and the President and his chief-of-staff had no time to spare .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 24]: `` You have come to bring me luck , Carmela meu , '' said De Sylva , stroking his daughter 's hair affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 9]: `` To-day we make our first real advance .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 14]: Salvador and I are going to the front now , almost this instant .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 28]: But there will be no fighting -- an affair of outposts at the best -- and when everything is in order we shall return here to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 9]: Expect us , then , soon after sunset .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 21]: Meanwhile , at the _ quinta _ you will find the young English lady of whose presence you are aware .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 5]: Give her your friendship .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 7]: She is worthy of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 6]: `` Adeos , senhora ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 15]: echoed San Benavides , bringing his heels together with a click , and saluting .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 24]: He gathered a number of papers from the table with nervous haste , and at once began to issue instructions to several officers .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 8]: De Sylva renewed the signing of documents .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 8]: Russo and he conversed in low tones .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 10]: A buzz of talk broke out in the tent .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 25]: Carmela felt that she had no part in this activity , that her mere presence was a positive hindrance to the work in hand .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 46]: A trifle disappointed , yet not without a thrill of high resolve to create for herself an indispensable share in the movement of which her father was the central figure , she went out , unhitched her tired horse , and walked to the house .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 20]: In Brazil , a _ quinta _ , or farm , may range from a palace to a hovel .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 13]: Dom Corria was rich ; consequently Las Flores attained the higher level .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 40]: It was a straggling , roomy structure , planned for comfort and hospitality rather than display , and the gardens , to whose beauty and extent was due the Spanish name , used to be famous throughout the province .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 45]: Carmela had not seen the place during five years ; she expected to find changes , but was hardly prepared for the ravages made by neglect , aided by unchecked tropical growth , as the outcome of her father 's two years in prison .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 20]: The flowers were gone , the rarer shrubs choked by rank weeds , the trees disfigured by rampant climbers .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 28]: But , in front of the long , deep veranda , even the attention of a month had restored much of its beauty to a widespread lawn .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 52]: Here , at that early hour , the air was cool and the shade abundant ; indeed , so embossed in towering trees was the wide greensward , that it seemed to flow abruptly into the veranda without ever a path or garden gate to break the solid walls of foliage .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 53]: Filled with tumultuous memories , her heart all throbbing at the prospect of her father 's fortunes being restored , the Senhora De Sylva was entering a gate that led to the left front of the house , when the young man came out whom she had seen leaving the headquarters tent .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 26]: Again he rode like one in a hurry , and she noted that he emerged from a side path which gave access to the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 10]: He gave her a sharp glance as he passed .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 30]: She received an impression of a strong face , with stern-looking , bright , steel-blue eyes , a mouth tensely set , an aspect at once confident yet self-contained .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 48]: She was sure now he was not a Brazilian , and he differed most materially from the mental picture of Captain James Coke created by the many conversations in which he had figured during her long voyage from Southampton in company with David Verity and Dickey Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 44]: So Carmela wondered now who he could be , nor was her wonder lessened when she peered through the screen of trees , and saw a girl , whom she recognized instantly as Iris , furtively dabbing her tear-stained face with a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 12]: Unhappily , the President 's daughter was not attractive in appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 50]: She had fine eyes , and she moved with the natural elegance of her race , but her features were somewhat angular for one of pure-blooded Portuguese descent , and a too well-defined chin was more effectual as an index of character than as an element of personal charm .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 53]: Close acquaintance with the cosmopolitan society of Paris and London had familiarized her with many types of European and American beauty , and her surprise that such an uncommonly good-looking girl should be the niece of David Verity was not unmingled with pique at finding her already installed in remote Las Flores .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 11]: The veranda seemed to be a hive of feminine industry .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 27]: The Dona Pondillo and her daughters , together with the female relatives of several noted men among the insurgents , were cutting and stitching most industriously .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 14]: Iris Yorke 's advice , perhaps her assistance , was evidently in demand .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 42]: Assuming that the young man who rode thither so rapidly had gone to see her , she could not have been absent from the sewing party more than five minutes , yet half a dozen ladies were clamoring for her already .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 17]: The truth was that many of them had never plied a needle before in their lives .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 7]: They had to be taught everything .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 20]: One peasant woman would have accomplished more real work than any five of the Librationist _ grandes dames _ .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 17]: Despite her firm chin , Carmela De Sylva did not contemn the meretricious aid of dress .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 17]: Iris looked fresh and cool in soft muslin , whereas the newcomer was travel-stained and disheveled .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 50]: The pack-mules were lagging on the road , but a wash and general tidying of dust-covered garments would help the President 's daughter to regain the assurance , now sadly lacking , which would be necessary ere she won her rightful place in a community largely composed of strangers .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 34]: As she led her horse back into the main avenue , she was sorry that her father or Salvador could not spare even the few minutes that would have sufficed for an introduction .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 32]: At any rate , she would probably find an old servant at the back of the house -- some family retainer whose welcome would charm away this displeasing sense of intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 12]: On the way to the stables she heard a man singing .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 6]: The words were in English .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 29]: They were also quaint , for they dealt with life from a point of view which differed widely from that presented by Dom Corria 's _ finca _ .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 62]: `` Oh , it 's fine to be a sailor '' -LSB- sang Watts -RSB- , `` an ' to cross the ragin ' main , From Hooghly bar to New Orleens to roam , But I ` ope that my old woman will put me on the chain Next time I want to quit my ` umble ` ome . ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 20]: Possibly the verse was an original effort , because there followed a marked change in tune and meter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 41]: ` Mid pleasures an ' palaces -- ' '' he began , when Senhora De Sylva came upon him as he sat on a fence , pipe in hand , with his back braced comfortably against a magnificent rosewood tree .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 23]: He stopped , grinned sheepishly , and , not recognizing the lady , tried to cover his confusion by lighting the pipe .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 13]: `` Are you one of the _ Andromeda 's _ men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 15]: asked Carmela , speaking in the clear and accurate English used by her father .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 14]: It was well for Watts that the tree prevented him from falling backwards .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 54]: He was quite sober , but cheerful withal , as he had nothing to do but sleep , smoke , eat , and drink the light wine of the district , of which his only complaint was that `` one might mop up a barrel of it an ' get no forrarder . ''
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 23]: Nevertheless , he received a positive shock when addressed in his own language by a young woman who was obviously of Brazil .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 20]: He stared at her so hard that he forgot the steady progress of the slow-burning tand-stikkor match recently ignited .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 10]: Its sulphurous flame reached his fingers and reminded him .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 5]: `` My godfather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 14]: he howled , springing from the rail , and recovering his wits instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 19]: `` Beg pardon , mum , but you took me aback all standin ' as the saying is .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 11]: Christopher , did n't that match wake me up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 24]: `` I am afraid it is my fault , '' said Carmela , who could look sympathetic where Iris would want to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 26]: `` I have just arrived here , and everybody seems to be so full of troubles that I am glad to hear you singing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 11]: `` Oh , that 's just hummin ' , mum .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 28]: If you 're fond of music you ought to ` ear Schmidt , Captain Schmidt of the _ Unser Fritz _ -- '' Carmela struck an attitude .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 9]: `` Wot , d'ye know ` im ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 3]: asked Watts .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 10]: `` No , it is something -- rather important .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 8]: I must go back to my father .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 7]: Ah , I ought to explain .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 13]: I am the Senhora De Sylva , Dom Corria 's daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 11]: `` Are you really , mum , -- miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 7]: exclaimed Watts , highly interested . ''
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 15]: ` Ow in the world did ye manage to come up from the coast ?
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 18]: Accordin ' to all accounts -- '' `` Yes , what were you going to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 5]: for the man hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 23]: `` Well , some of our chaps will ` ave it that we 're runnin ' close-hauled on a lee shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 5]: Carmela knit her brows .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 10]: The Watts idioms were not those of her governess .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 25]: `` We had no great difficulty in passing through Dom Barraca 's lines , if that is what you mean , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 29]: `` Mr. Verity and Mr. Bulmer had obtained special permits , but in my case -- '' `` Mr. ` oo , did you say , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 12]: demanded Watts , whose lower jaw actually dropped from sheer amazement .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 12]: `` Mr. Verity , the owner of the _ Andromeda _ .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 11]: You are one of the crew , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 7]: `` I 'm the chief officer .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 7]: Watts is my name , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 38]: But d'you mean to tell me that ole David Verity ` as come ` ere -- to Brazil -- to this rotten ... Sorry , miss , but you gev ' me a turn , you did .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 15]: An ' Dickey Bulmer -- is _ ` e _ ` ere too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 10]: `` Yes , or he soon will be here .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 10]: I rode on in advance of the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 14]: `` Well -- there -- if that do n't beat cock-fightin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 3]: cried Watts .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 6]: `` Wot 'll Coke say ?
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 12]: W ` y , ` e 'll ` ave a fit .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 5]: An ' Miss Iris !
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 7]: She 's to marry ole Dickey .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 7]: Fancy ` im turnin ' up !
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 28]: There 'll be the deuce an ' all to pay , now , wot between ` im an ' Hozier an ' the dashin ' colonel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 34]: The horse , trying to nibble some grass at Carmela 's feet , suddenly threw his head up , for the cruel South American bit had tightened under a jerk of the reins .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 7]: `` Who is Mr. Hozier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 5]: asked the girl calmly .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 33]: `` He is , or was , our second mate , but since the colonel an ' ' e got to loggerheads ' e took an ' raised a corps of scouts .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 10]: Some of our fellows joined , but not me .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 13]: Killin ' other folks do n't agree with me a little bit .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 43]: I do n't mind a shine in a snug or a friendly scrap over an extry drink , but w ` en it comes to them long knives -- '' `` And the colonel -- what is _ his _ name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 10]: broke in Carmela , turning to loosen the surcingle .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 21]: She could control her voice but not her eyes , and she did not wish to startle this open-mouthed gossip .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 6]: `` San Benavides , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 20]: Captain ' e was on Fernando Noronha ; ' e took a mighty quick jump after we kem ashore .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 14]: But I ax your pardon for ramblin ' on in this silly way .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 6]: Wo n't you go inside ?
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 78]: There 's a useful ole party there , name of Maria -- '' `` Ah , Maria -- dear , good Maria -- she at least will not have forgotten me , '' sobbed Carmela in her own tongue , and Watts afterwards informed Coke that although the inhabitants of China were noted for their peculiar ways , when it came to a show-down in that qualification , the average woman could beat any Chinky ever born .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 24]: Had he but known more , Watts was also in a position to state that he had squared accounts with the scornful President .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 73]: For the Senhora De Sylva might have been seized with mortal illness if judged solely by the manner in which she staggered into her father 's house , threw her arms around the neck of an elderly woman whom she petrified by her appearance , and almost fainted -- not quite , but on the verge , much nearer than such a strong-minded young lady would have thought possible an hour earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 4]: Maria screamed loudly .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 16]: Tongue-tied at first , she was badly scared when Carmela collapsed on her ample bosom .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 5]: Restoratives and endearments followed .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 22]: Carmela asked to be taken to a room where she might wash and shake the dust from her hair and clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 6]: Maria considered ways and means .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 9]: Every room in the big house was crowded .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 9]: `` Who is in my own apartment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 3]: demanded Carmela .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 11]: Even before the answer was forthcoming she guessed the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 7]: The Senhora Ingleza , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 8]: Those fine eyes of hers flashed dangerously .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 5]: `` What , then ?
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 10]: Does this woman come here and take all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 16]: `` Ah , _ pequinina _ , do not be angry , '' said Maria .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 16]: `` Who save the good God could tell that you would come from Paris to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 13]: And the Senhora Ingleza will be glad to give place to you .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 8]: She is so kind , so unselfish .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 7]: All the men adore her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 51]: `` So I hear , '' murmured Carmela , trying to still the passion that throbbed in her heart , since she was aware that neither Maria nor any other among the old domestics at Las Flores knew of her engagement , and pride was now coming to her aid .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 17]: `` She will have no word to say to any of them , '' gabbled Maria .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 36]: `` There is a young Englishman -- well , it is no affair of mine , but I am told she loves him , yet is promised to another , an old man , too .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 5]: _ Santa M√£e _ !
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 12]: That would not suit me if I were her age ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 13]: This home-coming of Carmela was quite an important event in its way .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 21]: At first sight it bore the semblance of a mere disillusionment such as any girl might experience under like circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 30]: She had been taken from Las Flores to occupy a palace at Rio de Janeiro , and was driven from the palace to the hotel life of the Continent .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 29]: During two years she had not seen either father or lover ; and lovers of the San Benavides ilk are apt to console themselves during these prolonged intervals .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 16]: Yet Carmela 's shattered romance was the pivot on which rested the future of Brazil .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 47]: Had she gone straight to Iris on leaving her father , and made known the astounding tidings that Verity and Bulmer were riding up the Moxoto Valley barely three miles away , Iris would surely have devised some means of acquainting Philip Hozier with the fact .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 27]: In that event , assuming that he awaited their arrival , the first march of an extended reconnaissance which he thought desirable would necessarily be postponed .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 40]: And then -- well , the recent history of Brazil would have to be re-written , since there can not be the slightest doubt that Dom Corria De Sylva would never have occupied the Presidential chair a second time .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 24]: It would be idle now to inquire too closely into the springs of Philip 's resolve to take service under a foreign flag .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 27]: Perhaps the irksome state of affairs at Las Flores , where there was no mean between loafing and soldiering , was intolerable to a spirited youngster .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 20]: Perhaps San Benavides , constantly riding in from the front , irritated him beyond endurance by his superior airs .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 31]: Or it may be that a growing belief in Iris 's determination to sacrifice herself by redeeming her bond made him careless as to what happened in the near future .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 27]: The outcome of one or all of these influences was that he sought , and was readily given , a commission in the Army of Liberation .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 34]: Like all sailors , he preferred the mounted arm , and De Sylva , having the highest opinion of his thoroughness , actually appointed him to command a branch of the Intelligence Department .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 32]: Philip , trained to pin his faith in maps and charts , came to the conclusion that Las Flores could be attacked from the rear , which lay to the northwest .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 7]: The Brazilians laughed at the notion .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 8]: Where were the troops to come from ?
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 9]: Barraca must bring all his men by sea .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 9]: There were none stationed in those wild mountains .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 11]: `` Better go and make sure , '' quoth Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 36]: He ascertained the President 's intentions as to the next twenty-four hours , assembled his little body of scouts , saw to their forage and equipment , took leave of Iris , and hurried off .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 37]: When two stout and elderly fellow-countrymen of his climbed the last mile of the rough valley beneath the Las Flores slope , Philip and his troop were a league or more beyond the Moxoto 's watershed .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 19]: Meanwhile , Carmela De Sylva proved that her resolute chin was not deceptive as a guide to temperament .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 28]: The Dona Pondillo deemed her a spirit when she appeared on the veranda , but Carmela 's impetuous kiss soon disabused the worthy dame of her error .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 45]: Iris , wondering why the lively chatter of her Brazilian friends was so suddenly stilled , to be succeeded by a hubbub of excited words as the older ladies present gathered around the new-comer , asked one of the Pondillo girls what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 15]: `` It is Carmela , the President 's daughter , '' giggled the other .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 10]: `` Mother says she is engaged to San Benavides .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 3]: What fun !
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 7]: But where has she come from ?
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 12]: When last I heard of her she was in Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 31]: A month of close companionship with people who spoke Portuguese all day long , and often far into the night , had familiarized Iris with many of the common phrases .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 16]: Thus , she gathered one fact as to Carmela , and more than suspected another .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 17]: For a reason that every woman will understand , she felt a subtle thrill of fear .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 21]: If San Benavides were really Carmela 's accepted lover , then , indeed , Iris had good cause for foreboding .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 31]: Though the Brazilian had never directly avowed his passion , since he knew quite well that she would refuse to listen , she could not be blind to his infatuation .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 17]: Only the threat of her dire displeasure had restrained Hozier from an open quarrel with him .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 52]: Her position , difficult enough already , would become intolerable if De Sylva 's daughter became jealous , and she had no doubt whatsoever that San Benavides would seek to propitiate the woman he loved by callously telling the woman he had promised to marry that his affections were bestowed elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 36]: Her heart sank when she discovered this new maelstrom in her sea of troubles ; but here was Carmela herself speaking to her , and in English : `` So you are Iris Yorke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 5]: the girl was saying .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 21]: `` I have heard so much of you , yet you are so utterly different from what I imagined . ''
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 10]: `` You have heard of _ me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 16]: repeated Iris , and surprise helped her to smile with something of her wonted self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 8]: `` Yes , on board the steamer .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 16]: We sailed from Southampton , and had little else to talk of during the voyage .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 10]: But , of course , you can not understand .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 11]: Among my fellow-passengers were your uncle and Mr. Bulmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 28]: Iris had long relinquished any hope of communicating with Bootle until the present deadlock in the operations of the two armies was a thing of the past .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 39]: Completely mystified now by Carmela 's glib reference to the two men whose names were so often in her thoughts though seldom on her lips , she could only gaze at the Senhora De Sylva in silent bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 17]: Carmela , feeling that she was gaining ground rapidly , affected a note of polite regret .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 9]: `` Please forgive me for being so abrupt .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 8]: Perhaps I ought to have prepared you .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 6]: But it is quite true .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 11]: Mr. Verity and Mr. Bulmer came with me from Europe .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 9]: We all reached Pernambuco the day before yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 23]: Indeed , if it were not for them , and the assistance they gave me , I would not be here now .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 25]: No one recognized me , fortunately , and -- I hope you will not be vexed -- I passed as Mr. Verity 's niece .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 12]: In fact , I took your place for the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 12]: A notable feature of the De Sylva utterance was its clearness .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 13]: Carmela 's concluding words could not possibly be mistaken for anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 29]: Their meaning , on the other hand , was capable of varying shades of significance ; but Iris was far too amazed to seek depths beneath their literalness .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 25]: `` If Mr. Verity and Mr. Bulmer are in Brazil -- '' she began tremulously , but Carmela broke in with a shrill laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 8]: `` There is no ` if . '
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 10]: Look below there , near my father 's tent !
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 4]: They have arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 6]: They are asking for you .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 7]: Come , let us meet them !
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 10]: I must see my father before he departs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 15]: Iris 's swimming eyes could not discern the figures to which Carmela was pointing .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 15]: But this strange girl 's triumphant tone rang like a knell in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 19]: She was not thinking now of the complications that might arise between San Benavides and his discarded flame .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 53]: She only knew that , by some miracle , her uncle had come to bring her home , and with him was the man to whom she was plighted , while Philip , only half an hour ago , had told her he would not see her again until the following evening .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 9]: So this was the end of her dream .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 22]: Bitter-sweet it had been , and long drawn out , but forthwith she must awake to the gray actualities of life .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 11]: She felt Carmela dragging her onward , irresistibly , vindictively .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 20]: She saw , as through a mist , David Verity 's fiery-hued face , and heard his harsh accents .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 7]: Yes , there was no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 13]: Here was Bootle transported to Brazil , Linden House to Las Flores !
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 37]: `` By gum , lass , '' he was bellowing , with a touch of real sentiment in his voice , `` you 've given us a rare dance afore we caught up wi ' you .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 25]: But ` ere you are , bright as a cherry , an ' ` ere is Dickey an ' meself come to fetch you .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 30]: Dash my wig , there 's life in the old dogs yet , or we 'd never ha ' bin able to ride forty mile through this God-forgotten country .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 14]: An ' damme if that is n't Coke , red as a lobster .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 9]: Jimmie , me boy , put it there !
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 13]: Man , but you 're a dashed long way from port ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 10]: Happily , Iris was too stunned to betray herself .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 18]: She extended a hand to the sun-browned , white-haired old man standing by her uncle 's side .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 17]: `` I am very glad to see you , Mr. Bulmer , '' she said simply .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 43]: And , in that hour of searing agony , she meant it , for it is easier to look back on suffering than to await it , and she had been living in dread of this meeting for many a weary day .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 36]: CHAPTER XV SHOWING HOW BRAZIL CHOSE HER PRESIDENT Two thousand five hundred years ago the prophet Jeremiah expressed incredulity as to the power of an Ethiopian to change his skin or a leopard his spots .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 46]: The march of the centuries has fully justified the seer 's historic doubt , so it makes but slight demand on the critical faculties to assume that two years ' residence in Europe had not cooled the hot southern blood flowing in Carmela 's veins .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 44]: She had hated Iris before she set eyes on her ; she hated her now that she had seen her rare beauty ; she gloated on the suffering inflicted by the presence of the faded old man who claimed her as his bride .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 51]: Though it was of the utmost importance that she should hasten to her father , she returned to Las Flores in her rival 's company , their arms linked in seeming friendship , and the Brazilian girl 's ears alert to treasure every word that told of Bulmer 's wooing .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 20]: Therein she greatly miscalculated the true gentility of one whom his cronies described as `` a rough diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 7]: Bulmer realized that Iris was overwrought .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 28]: Vague but sensational items in newspapers had prepared him in some measure for the story of her wanderings since last they met in quiet , old-fashioned Bootle .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 40]: He felt that she was altered , that their ways in life had deviated with a sharpness that was not to be brought back into parallel grooves simply because he had traveled many thousands of miles to find her .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 55]: So Dickey contented himself by listening to Coke 's Homeric account of the _ Andromeda 's _ wrecking , and if he interposed an occasional question , and thus drew the girl 's sweet voice into the talk , it was invariably germane to the strange history of the ship and her human freight .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 8]: Coke 's narrative was picturesque and lurid .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 23]: At times , he called himself to order ; at times , both Iris and Carmela affected not to have heard him .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 7]: But Carmela 's interest never flagged .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 5]: Nor did Bulmer 's .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 51]: As the yarn progressed -- for Watts and Schmidt and Norrie had joined them , and the whole party was seated in an inner room where an impromptu meal was provided -- both the woman of Brazil and the man of Lancashire seized on the same unspoken _ motif _ .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 11]: Every incident centered in the striking personality of Philip Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 36]: From the instant the second shell struck the winch , and laid him apparently dead on the forecastle , to the very hour of this coming together at Las Flores , Hozier held the stage .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 40]: It was he who took Iris on his shoulders and brought her to safety through the spume of the wrathful sea , he who carried her to the hut , he who crossed Fernando Noronha alone to protect her .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 4]: Coke was impartial .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 31]: He would have minimized his own singular bravery in running up the ship 's signals had not Iris given him a breathing-space while she enthralled the others with her description .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 10]: Otherwise , Coke skipped no line of his epic .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 50]: `` You 'll rec ` lect , '' he wheezed , in a voice that rasped like a file , `` you 'll rec ` lect , Mr. Verity , as I said to you that Hozier was good enough to take charge of the bridge of a battleship .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 28]: By -- well , any ` ow , if I 'd said the Channel Fleet I should n't ` ave bin talkin ' through me ` at .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 6]: Look at ` im now .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 20]: ` E 's the on ' y reel live man Dom Wot 's - ` is-name ` as got .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 3]: Sink me !
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 47]: if it was n't for the folks at ` ome , an ' the fac ' that the _ Andromeeda 's _ skipper ought to keep clear of politics in this crimson country , I 'd ` ave a cut in at the game meself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 34]: It might be hoped that Carmela 's mood would soften when she discovered her rival 's hapless love , but that would be expecting something which her bursting southern heart could not give .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 9]: A volcano pours forth lava , not water .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 6]: It scorches , not heals .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 13]: Iris , willing or not , had sapped her Salvador 's allegiance .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 28]: Carmela wanted to see those curved lips writhing in pain , those brown eyes dimmed , that smooth brow wrung with the grief that knows no remedy .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 15]: A fierce joy leaped up in her when Verity spoke of an early departure .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 23]: `` You see , Iris , '' he explained , `` these Brazilian bucks may be months in settlin ' their differences .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 72]: Dickey an ' me , ` elped a lot by our Consul , squeezed a pass out of the President -- beg pardon , miss , but ' e is President , in Pernambuco , at all events , '' he said in an apologetic `` aside '' to Carmela -- `` an ' the sooner we make tracks for ole England the better it 'll be for all of us .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 10]: Wot do you say to an early start to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 22]: We 'd be off to-night , on ' y I 'm feared my rheumaticky bones would n't stand the racket . ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 23]: The color ebbed from Iris 's face , but she said at once : `` I shall be ready , uncle dear .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 38]: I promised Dom Corria to look after the hospital appliances that are so much needed by the poor soldiers , but the Senhora De Sylva will attend to that much more effectually than I. '' `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 6]: Then that 's settled . ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 12]: David pursed out his thick lips with a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 37]: Though he had watched the spoken record of the _ Andromeda _ and her company for craftier hints than was suspected by his fellow travelers , he was not deaf to Coke 's appreciation of Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 34]: The silence of his niece on that same topic was alarming , but the position could not be so bad if she was willing to leave for the coast without seeing him again .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 12]: No secret was made of Philip 's errand into the interior .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 16]: The homeward-bound cavalcade would be at Pesqueira ere he returned to the _ finca _ .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 19]: Carmela , of course , did not believe in a woman 's complacency in such a vital matter .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 38]: She was ever prepared to spring , to strike , to wrench their plans to suit her own ends ; but , contrive as she might , she could not succeed in leaving Iris alone with Bulmer .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 11]: Full of device , she was foiled at each turn .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 31]: The day wore , the sun went down , the starlit sky made beautiful a parched earth , but never a word in privacy did Iris exchange with her husband-to-be .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 14]: Carmela 's malice was not hidden from her , but she despised it .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 12]: There was some ease for her tortured brain in defeating it .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 36]: If the Senhora De Sylva had only understood how thoroughly the Englishwoman loathed her petty jealousy , it was possible that the few remaining hours of their enforced intimacy might have been rendered less irksome .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 16]: But , by this time , fate had gathered the slackened strings of their destinies .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 6]: Thenceforth they became her puppets .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 52]: Permitted for a little while to play the tragi-comedy of life according to their own inclinations , now the stern edict had gone forth that they were to act their allotted parts in one of those fascinating if blood-stained dramas that the history of nations so often puts on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 9]: The future is the most cunning of playwrights .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 11]: No man may tell what the next scene shall be .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 30]: And no man , nor any woman , could guess the mad revel of hate and war that would rage that night around the placid homestead of Las Flores .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 31]: Behind the veranda was a huge ballroom , converted , by the exigencies of the campaign , into a dining hall for the many inmates of the _ finca _ .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 31]: The Brazilian ladies , the sailors , some sick or wounded officers who were not confined to bed , even the household servants , took their meals there in common .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 8]: Supper was served soon after nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 37]: When cigars and cigarettes were lighted , and the company broke up into laughing , gossiping , noisy groups , the place looked more like a popular Continental cafe than a room in a private mansion .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 41]: Though De Sylva , General Russo , San Benavides , and some score of members of the President 's staff who usually dined at the _ finca _ , were now absent , there was no lack of lively chatter .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 9]: A very Babel of tongues mixed in amity .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 9]: The prevalent note was one of cheery animation .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 28]: Carmela exerted herself to win popularity , and a President 's daughter need not put forth very strenuous efforts in that direction to be acclaimed by most .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 39]: Iris was listening , with real interest , to Verity 's description of the finding of Macfarlane in the _ Andromeda 's _ boat by a Cardiff-bound collier three days after he had drifted away from Fernando Noronha .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 16]: `` The yarn kem to us through the Consul at Pernambuco , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 14]: `` Evidently , from wot you tell me , it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 49]: Poor ole Mac ` ad a bad time afore ' e was picked up , but ' e was alive , an ' I 'm jolly glad of it , for ` e 'll be a first-rate witness w ` en this business comes up in court . ''
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 5]: `` Wot court ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 4]: demanded Coke sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 24]: `` The court that settles our claim , of course , '' retorted Verity , with a quick ferret look at his fellow-conspirator .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 7]: `` There 'll be no claim .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 9]: The President means to stump up in style .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 16]: You take my tip , an ' shut up about courts , '' said Coke .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 14]: `` It 'll cost Brazil a tidy penny , '' remarked Bulmer thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 42]: `` Nobody would ever imagine wot bags of gold an ' parcels of di ` monds sailors an ' firemen carry around in their kit-bags till a ship is lost an ' a Gover ` ment ` as to pay . ''
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 7]: Watts deemed this an exquisite joke .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 4]: He laughed loudly .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 9]: `` That reminds me , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 39]: `` W'en the _ Gem of the Sea _ turned turtle on the James an ' Mary -- '' A _ criado _ , a nondescript man-servant attached to the household , stooped over Iris and whispered something .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 42]: She gathered that she was wanted in the _ pat√®o _ , or court-yard , which , owing to the construction of the house , stood on one side instead of in front , where the lawn usurped its usual position .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 6]: `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 6]: The voice sank even lower .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 8]: `` Colonel San Benavides , Senhora . ''
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 25]: She had gathered sufficient of Brazilian ways to understand that the man had been bribed to convey this request to her without attracting attention .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 23]: `` Tell him to wait , '' she said , hoping to gain a moment wherein to decide how best to act .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 18]: `` It is urgent , Senhora -- _ ao mesmo tempo _ , the colonel said . ''
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 3]: `` Go !
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 6]: That is my answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 13]: The man 's unwillingness to obey showed how imperative were his instructions .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 17]: She rose , and the _ criado _ hurried out , satisfied that she would follow .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 10]: But Iris had no wish to meet San Benavides .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 30]: If she were seen with him in the dark _ pat√®o _ at this late hour , fuel would be added to the fire of Carmela 's foolish spite .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 19]: She was aware of Carmela 's covert glance watching her from the other end of the long room .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 6]: What was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 8]: Why not send Carmela in her stead ?
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 16]: They were almost of the same height , and dressed somewhat alike in flowered muslin .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 38]: It would be an amusing mistake , though annoying , perhaps , to San Benavides ; at any rate , Carmela would not object , and Iris was fully resolved not to keep the tryst in person .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 7]: She walked straight to her enemy .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 18]: `` Colonel San Benavides awaits you in the _ pat√®o _ , '' she said in English .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 7]: `` Awaits _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 11]: There was no mistaking the gleam in those jet-black eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 20]: The smoldering fire flamed into furnace heat at the implied indignity of such a mandate being delivered by Iris .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 10]: `` I suppose so , '' said Iris carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 7]: `` A servant brought the message .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 23]: He came to me in the first instance , but I am just going to my room to pack my few belongings .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 10]: We leave here at daybreak , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 5]: Carmela tried to smile .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 29]: `` I shall be sorry to lose you , '' she said , `` though I admit it will be pleasant to occupy my own room again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 6]: Then Iris was genuinely distressed .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 33]: `` I had not the least notion -- '' she began , but Carmela nodded and made off , saying as she went : `` What matter -- for one night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 11]: So , at last , she would learn the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 7]: Salvador was out there , alone .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 6]: She would soon judge him .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 9]: If he were innocent , she would know .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 19]: If he had merely been made the sport of a designing woman , she was ready to forgive .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 51]: In a more amiable mood than she had displayed at any moment since her arrival at Las FIores , Carmela hastened along a dark corridor , crossed a bare hall , passed through a porch , and searched the shadows of the pat√®o for the form of her one-time lover .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 18]: A voice whispered , in French : `` Come quickly , Senhora , I pray you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 29]: It startled her to find San Benavides talking French , until it occurred to her that Iris and he must converse in that language or hardly at all .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 5]: The thought was disquieting .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 5]: The volcano stirred again .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 8]: `` Senhora , je vous prie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 13]: again pleaded the man , who was on horseback under the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 10]: She did not hesitate , but ran to him .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 40]: Without a word of explanation , he bent sideways , caught her in his arms , drew her up until she was seated on the holsters strapped to a gaucho saddle , and wheeled his horse into a gallop .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 11]: Filled with a grim determination , she uttered no protest .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 16]: Not a syllable crossed her lips lest he should strive to amend his woeful blunder .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 24]: She noticed that they were not going toward the camp , but circling round the enclosed land in the direction of the hills .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 18]: Though the night was dark , the stars gave light enough for the horse to move freely .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 6]: Carmela 's head was bent .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 36]: A gauze-like mantilla covered her black hair , and , strange though it may seem , one woman 's small waist and slim figure can be amazingly like the same physical attributes in another woman .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 13]: But San Benavides wondered why the cold Ingleza had surrendered so silently .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 17]: He expected at least a scream , a struggle , an impassioned demand to be released .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 14]: He was prepared for anything save a dumb acceptance of this extraordinary raid .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 6]: So he began to explain .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 7]: `` One word , Senhora ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 7]: `` You must think me mad .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 4]: I am not .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 4]: All is lost !
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 5]: Our army is defeated !
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 11]: In an hour Las Flores will be in flames ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 7]: The girl quivered in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 7]: A moaning cry came from her .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 10]: `` It is true , I swear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 3]: he vowed .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 7]: `` I mean you no ill .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 20]: I fought till the end , and my good horse alone carried me in advance of the routed troops .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 23]: Dom Corria may reach the _ finca _ alive , but , even so , he and the rest will be killed .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 7]: I refused to escape without you .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 12]: Believe me or not , you are dearer than life itself .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 10]: In the confusion we two may not be missed .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 11]: Trust yourself wholly to me , I beseech you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 25]: He spoke jerkily , in the labored phrase of a man who has to pick and choose the readiest words in an unfamiliar language .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 19]: Carmela , with a sudden movement , raised her face to his , and threw aside her veil .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 4]: `` Salvador ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 6]: His eyes glared into hers .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 14]: His frenzied clutch at the reins pulled the horse on to its haunches .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 4]: `` My God !
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 4]: ... Carmela ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 4]: he almost shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 25]: So you are running away , Salvador -- running away with the English miss -- deserting my father in the hour of his need !
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 11]: But she will die with the others , you say .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 8]: Well , then -- join her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 19]: During that quick twist on the horse 's withers , she had plucked a revolver from a holster .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 38]: She meant to shatter that false face of his utterly , to blast him as with lightning ... but the lock snapped harmlessly , for San Benavides had , indeed , borne himself gallantly in the fray .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 11]: He struck at her now in a whirl of fury .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 22]: She winced , but with catamount activity drew back her arm and hit him on the temple with the heavy weapon .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 15]: He collapsed limply , reeled from off the saddle , and they fell together .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 22]: The frightened horse , finding himself at liberty , galloped to the camp , where already there was an unusual commotion .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 9]: Carmela flung herself on the man 's body .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 11]: She was capable of extremes either of grief or passion .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 6]: `` Salvador , my love !
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 4]: my love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 3]: she screamed .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 6]: `` What have I done ?
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 6]: Speak to me , Salvador !
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 6]: It is I , Carmela !
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 10]: Oh , Mary Mother , come to my aid !
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 10]: I have killed him , killed my Salvador ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 14]: He looked very white and peaceful as he lay there in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 9]: She could not see whether his lips moved .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 12]: She was too distraught to note if his heart was beating .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 26]: It seemed incredible that she , a weak woman , should have crushed the life out of that lithe and active frame with one blow .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 10]: Then a dark stain appeared on the white skin .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 11]: Her hands , her lips , were covered with blood .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 4]: She tasted it .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 7]: The whole earth reeked of it .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 7]: It scorched her as with vitriol .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 6]: She rose and ran blindly .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 5]: The darkness appalled her .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 29]: No matter now what fate befell , she must have light , the sound of human voices ... And she sobbed piteously as she ran : `` Salvador !
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 10]: Oh , God in heaven , my Salvador ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 15]: It is not the crime , but the conscience , that scourges erring humanity .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 6]: Carmela needed some such flogging .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 37]: It was just as well that her fright at the horrible touch of blood was not balanced by the saner knowledge that a ruptured vein was nature 's own remedy for a man jarred into insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 26]: Long before Carmela reached the _ finca _ , San Benavides stirred , groaned , squirmed convulsively , and raised himself on hands and knees .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 11]: He turned , and sat down , feeling his head .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 5]: `` The spit-fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 4]: `` The she-devil !
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 4]: And that other !
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 11]: Would that I could wring _ her _ neck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 9]: A sputtering of rifles crackled in the valley .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 8]: There was a blurred clamor of voices .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 14]: He looked at the sky , at the black summits of the hills .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 14]: He stood up , and his inseparable sword clanked on the stony ground .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 16]: `` Ah , well , '' he growled , `` I have done with women .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 9]: They have had the best of my life .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 9]: What is left I give to Brazil . ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 35]: So he , too , made for Las Flores , but slowly , for he was quite exhausted , and his limbs were stiff with the rigors of a wild day in the saddle .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 14]: Carmela went back to a household that paid scant heed to her screaming .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 14]: Dom Corria was there , bare-headed , his gorgeous uniform sword-slashed and blood-bespattered .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 27]: General Russo , too , was beating his capacious chest and shouting : `` God 's bones , let us make a fight of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 24]: A sprinkling of soldiers , all dismounted cavalry or gunners , a few disheveled officers , had accompanied De Sylva in his flight .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 17]: With reckless bravery , he and Russo had tried to rally the troops camped at headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 6]: It was a hopeless effort .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 8]: Half-breeds can never produce a military caste .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 35]: They may fight valiantly in the line of battle -- they will not face the unknown , the terrible , the harpies that come at night , borne on the hurricane wings of panic .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 15]: Unhappily , De Sylva and his bodyguard were the messengers of their own disaster .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 10]: The cowardly genius at Pesqueira had planned a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 20]: He would not lead it , of course , but in Dom Miguel Barraca he found an eager substitute .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 33]: It was a coup of the Napoleonic order ; an infantry attack along the entire front of the Liberationist position cloaked the launching against the center of a formidable body of cavalry .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 35]: The project was to thrust this lance into the rebel position , probe it thoroughly , as a surgeon explores a gunshot wound , and extract the offender in the guise of Dom Corria .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 7]: The scheme had proved eminently successful .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 16]: The Liberationists were crumpled up , and here was Dom Corria making his last stand .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 12]: He deserved better luck , for he was magnificent in failure .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 19]: Calm as ever , he tried to be shot or captured when the reserves in camp failed him .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 11]: Russo and the rest dragged him onward by main force .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 10]: `` They want me only , '' he urged .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 9]: `` My death will end a useless struggle .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 16]: I shall die a little later , when many more of my friends are killed .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 6]: Why not die now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 5]: They would not listen .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 6]: `` It is night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 3]: they cried .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 8]: `` The enemy 's horses are spent .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 10]: A determined stand may give us another chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 7]: But it was a forlorn hope .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 26]: As San Benavides lurched into the _ pat√®o _ , the horses of the first pursuing detachment strained up the slope between house and encampment .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 34]: Carmela , all her fire gone , the pallid ghost of the vengeful woman who would have shattered her lover 's skull were the revolver loaded , was the first to see him .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 6]: She actually crouched in terror .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 5]: Her tongue was parched .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 11]: If she uttered some low cry , none heard her .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 19]: Dom Corria , striving to dispose his meager garrison as best he could , met his trusted lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 6]: His face lit with joy .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 8]: `` Ah , my poor Salvador ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 12]: `` I thought we had lost you at the ford ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 8]: `` No , '' said San Benavides .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 6]: `` I ran away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 10]: Even in his dire extremity , De Sylva smiled .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 13]: `` Would that others had run like you , my Salvador ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 11]: `` Then we should have been in Pernambuco to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 5]: The Brazilian looked around .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 9]: His eye dwelt heedlessly on the cowering Carmela .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 32]: He was searching for Iris , who had been compelled by Coke and Bulmer and her uncle to take shelter behind the score of sailors who still remained at Las Flores .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 12]: `` It is true , nevertheless , '' he said laconically .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 20]: `` I knew the game was lost , so I came here to try and save a lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 6]: `` Ah -- our Carmela ?
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 6]: You thought of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 7]: Then the spell passed from Carmela .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 8]: She literally threw herself on her lover .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 8]: `` Yes , it is true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 3]: she shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 24]: `` He came to save me , but I preferred to die here -- with you , father -- and with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 16]: Dom Corria did not understand these fire-works , but he had no time for thought .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 8]: Bullets were crashing through the closed Venetians .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 34]: Light they must have , or the defense would become an orgy of self-destruction , yet light was their most dangerous foe when men were shooting from the somber depths of the trees .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 9]: The assailants were steadily closing around the house .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 8]: Their rifles covered every door and window .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 11]: Each minute brought up fresh bands in tens and twenties .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 7]: At last , Barraca himself arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 13]: Some members of his staff made a hasty survey of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 24]: There were some three hundred men available , and , in all probability , Dom Corria could not muster one-sixth of that number .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 9]: It was a crisis that called for vigor .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 23]: The cavalry lance was twenty miles from its base , and there was no knowing what accident might reunite the scattered Liberationists .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 31]: One column , at least , of the Nationalists had failed to keep its rendezvous , or this last desperate stand at Las Flores would have proved a sheer impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 13]: So the house must be rushed , no matter what the cost .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 7]: This was a war of leaders .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 20]: Let Dom Corria fall , and his most enthusiastic supporters would pay Dom Miguel 's taxes without further parley .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 9]: A scheme of concerted action was hastily arranged .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 12]: Simultaneously , five detachments swarmed against the chosen points of assault .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 63]: One crossed the _ pat√®o _ to the porch , another made for the stable entrance , a third attacked the garden door , a fourth assailed the servants ' quarters , and the fifth , strongest of all , and inspired by Dom Miguel 's presence , battered in the shutters and tore away the piled up furniture of the ballroom .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 9]: The Nationalist leader 's final order was terse .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 19]: `` Spare the women ; shoot every rebel ; do not touch the foreigners unless they resist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 9]: With yells of `` Abajo De Sylva ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 6]: `` Morto por revoltados ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 5]: the assailants closed in .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 28]: Neither side owned magazine rifles , so the fight was with machetes , swords , and bayonets when the first furious hail of lead had spent itself .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 16]: No man thought of quarter , nor ceased to stab and thrust until he fell .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 40]: Not even then did some of the half-savage combatants desist , and a many a thigh was gashed and boot-protected leg cut to the bone by those murderous hatchet knives wielded by hands which would soon stiffen in death .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 54]: When three hundred desperadoes meet fifty of like caliber in a hand-to-hand conflict -- when the three hundred mean to end the business , and the fifty know that they must die -- fighting for choice , but die in any event -- the resultant encounter will surely be both fierce and brief .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 16]: And never was fratricidal strife more sanguinary than during the earliest onset within the walls .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 18]: Each inch of corridor , each plank of the ballroom floor , was contested with insane ferocity .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 5]: This was not warfare .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 9]: It savored of the carnage of the jungle .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 8]: Its sounds were those of wild beasts .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 6]: It smelled of the shambles .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 40]: By one of those queer chances which sometimes decide the hazard between life and death , the window nearest that end of the room where the sailors strove to protect a few shrieking women had not been broken in .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 59]: Here , then , was a tiny bay of refuge ; from it the men of the _ Andromeda _ and the _ Unser Fritz _ , Bulmer , Verity , Iris , and such of the Brazilian ladies as had not fled to the upper rooms at the initial volley , looked out on an amazing butchery .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 26]: De Sylva , no longer young , and never a robust man , had been dragged from mortal peril many times by his devoted adherents .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 23]: Carmela had snatched a machete from the fingers of a dying soldier , and was fighting like one possessed of a fiend .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 34]: Once , when a combined rush drove the defenders nearly on top of the non-combatants , Iris would have striven to draw the half-demented girl into the little haven with the other women .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 14]: But Coke thrust her back , shouting : `` Leave ` er alone .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 11]: She 'll set about you if you touch her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 29]: Dickey Bulmer , too , who was displaying a fortitude hardly to be expected in a man of his years and habits , thought that interference was useless .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 13]: `` Let ` er do what she can , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 12]: `` She does n't know wot is ` appenin ' now .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 16]: If she was on ' y watchin ' she 'd be a ravin ' lunatic .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 16]: God ` elp us all , we 've got ourselves into a nice mess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 28]: Somehow , the old man 's Lancashire drawl , with its broad vowels and misplaced aspirates , exercised a singularly soothing effect on Iris 's tensely-strung nerves .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 10]: It seemed to remove her from that murder-filled arena .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 41]: It was redolent of home , of quiet streets , of orderly crowds thronging to the New Brighton sands , of the sober , industrious , God-fearing folk who filled the churches and chapels at each service on a Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 35]: These men and women of Brazil were her brothers and sisters in the great comity of nations , yet Heaven knows they did not figure in such guise during that hour of intense emotions .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 23]: But if Dickey Bulmer 's simple words exalted him into the kingdom of the heroic , David Verity occupied a lower plane .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 8]: Prayers and curses alternated on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 6]: He was stupefied with fear .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 18]: He had never seen the lust of slaying in men 's eyes , and it mesmerized him .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 14]: Many of the sailors wanted to join in on behalf of their friends .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 10]: It needed all Coke 's vehemence to restrain them .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 14]: `` Keep out of it , you swabs , '' he would growl .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 9]: `` It 's your on ' y chanst .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 6]: This is n't our shindy .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 11]: Let 'em rip an ' be hanged to 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 33]: Yet he was manifestly uneasy , and he kept a wary eye on De Sylva , whom he appraised at a personal value of five thousand pounds `` an pickin 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 24]: A tall , distinguished-looking man , wearing a brilliant uniform , his breast decorated with many orders , now appeared on the scene .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 12]: He shouted something , and the attacking force redoubled their efforts .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 13]: He raised a revolver , and took deliberate aim at Dom Corria .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 17]: Coke saw him , and his bulldog pluck combined with avarice to overcome his common sense .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 18]: Without thought of the consequences , he sprang into the swaying mob and pulled De Sylva aside .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 9]: A bullet smashed into the wall behind them .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 7]: `` Look out , mister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 4]: he bellowed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 14]: ` Ere 's a blighter ` oo wants to finish you quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 8]: De Sylva 's glance sought his adversary .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 13]: He produced a revolver which hitherto had remained hidden in a pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 10]: Perhaps its bullets were not meant for an enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 7]: He fired at the tall man .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 16]: A violent swerve of the two irregular ranks of soldiers screened each from the other .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 20]: An opening offered , and the man who had singled out Dom Corria for his special vengeance fired again .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 8]: The bullet struck Coke in the breast .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 12]: The valiant little skipper staggered , and sank to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 9]: His fiery eyes gazed up into Verity 's .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 9]: `` Damme if I ai n't hulled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 24]: he roared , his voice loud and harsh as if he were giving some command from the bridge in a gale of wind .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 6]: David dropped to his knees .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 9]: `` For Gawd 's sake , Jimmie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 3]: he moaned .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 8]: `` Yes , I 've got it .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 8]: Sarve me dam well right , too !
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 13]: No business to go ag ` in me own pore old ship .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 11]: Look ` ere , Verity , I 'm done for !
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 18]: If you get away from this rotten muss , see to my missus an ' the girls .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 15]: If you do n't -- d -- n you -- '' `` Fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 8]: shouted a strong English voice from without .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 9]: A withering volley crashed through the open windows .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 14]: Full twenty of the assailants fell , Dom Miguel de Barraca among them .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 16]: There was an instant of terrible silence , as between the shocks of an earthquake .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 18]: -LSB- Illustration : A withering volley crashed through the window -RSB- `` Now , come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 24]: shouted the same voice , and Philip Hozier rushed into the ballroom , followed by his scouts and a horde of Brazilian regulars .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 32]: No one not actually an eye-witness of that thrilling spectacle would believe that a fight waged with such determined malevolence could stop so suddenly as did that fray in Las Flores .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 20]: It was true , now as ever , that men of a mixed race can not withstand the unforeseen .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 29]: Dom Miguel fallen , and his cohort decimated by the leaden storm that tore in at them from an unexpected quarter , the rest fled without another blow .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 22]: They raced madly for their horses , to find that every tethered group was in the hands of this new contingent .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 6]: Then the darkness swallowed them .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 7]: Dom Miguel 's cavalry was disbanded .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 8]: At once the medley within died down .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 12]: Men had no words as yet to meet this astounding development .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 9]: Dom Corria went to where his rival lay .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 5]: Dom Miguel was dying .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 13]: His eyes met De Sylva 's in a strange look of recognition .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 10]: He tried to speak , but choked and died .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 10]: Then the living President stooped over the dead one .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 4]: He murmured something .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 14]: Those near thought afterward that he said : `` Is it worth it ?
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 4]: Who knows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 17]: But he was surely President now ; seldom have power and place been more hardly won .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 6]: His quiet glance sought Philip .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 11]: `` Thank you , Mr. Hozier , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 7]: `` All Brazil is your debtor .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 10]: As for me , I can never repay you .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 26]: I owe you my life , the lives of my daughter and of many of my friends , and the success of my cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 8]: Philip heard him as in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 6]: He was looking at Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 17]: Her eyes were shining , her lips parted , yet she did not come to him .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 16]: By her side was standing a white-haired old man , an Englishman , a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 17]: Bending over Coke , and wringing his hands in incoherent sorrow , was another elderly Briton .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 13]: A fear that Philip had never before known gripped his heartstrings now .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 14]: He was pale and stern , and his forehead was seamed with foreboding .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 9]: `` Who is that with Miss Yorke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 6]: he said to Dom Corria .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 16]: The President had a rare knack of answering a straight question in a straight way .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 13]: `` A Mr. Bulmer , I am told , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 5]: There was a pause .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 26]: General Russo , carved from head to foot , but so stout withal that his enemies ' weapons had reached no vital part , approached .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 6]: He thumped his huge stomach .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 11]: `` We must rally our men , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 23]: `` If we collect even five thousand to-night -- '' `` Yes , '' said De Sylva , `` I will come .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 18]: Before I go , Mr. Hozier , let me repeat that I and Brazil are grateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 11]: `` May the devil take both you and Brazil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 17]: was Philip 's most ungracious reply , and he turned and strode out into the night .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 42]: CHAPTER XVI WHEREIN THE PRESIDENT PRESIDES Before the exciting story so rudely interrupted is resumed , it may be well to set down in their sequence the queer workings of fortune which led to Philip 's timely reappearance at Las FIores .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 9]: His troop of scouts consisted of twenty-eight men .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 21]: Five were sailors and firemen from the _ Andromeda _ ; three were Germans from the _ Unser Fritz _ .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 23]: But the whole eight were ex-soldiers , and one man-at-arms trained on the European model is worth ten of the Brazilian product .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 29]: The remaining twenty were hillmen , good riders , excellent shots , and acquainted with every yard of the wild country within a radius of a hundred miles .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 33]: They would fight anybody if well led , and here it may be observed that when Philip called on them to storm the ballroom , he said , `` Come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 14]: ; between which curt command and its congener , `` Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 8]: these half-breed warriors drew a fine distinction .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 41]: The language difficulty was surmounted partly by an interpreter in the person of one of the Germans , who spoke English and had lived in Bahia , partly by signs , and largely by Philip 's methods as a leader .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 40]: He never asked his men to do anything that he did not do himself , and they were never dubious as to his tactics , since he invariably closed with any Nationalist detachment met during the day 's operations .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 37]: About mid-day , then , they came upon the advance guard of a column sent off a week earlier by the expert at Pesqueira with instructions to arrive at Las Flores before sunset that very day .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 13]: Instantly the twenty-nine charged ; with equal celerity the advance guard bolted .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 19]: From the crest of a rocky pass Philip looked down on a column of fully a thousand men .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 5]: The situation was critical .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 6]: It called for prompt handling .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 36]: Five men held the horses ; twenty-three spread themselves among the rocks ; Philip unslung his carbine ; and twenty-four rifles indulged in long-range practice on a narrow mountain path crowded with men and animals .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 5]: Nothing more was needed .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 12]: It has been noted already that the Brazilians disliked long-range shooting .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 5]: There was a stampede .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 34]: The scouts occupied the ridge until sundown , and were returning leisurely to report the presence of the column , when they fell in with the first batch of fugitives from the valley .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 12]: Forthwith , Philip became a general and each scout an officer .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 54]: They reasoned and whacked the runaways into obedience , picked up quite a number of men who were willing enough to fight if told what was expected of them -- and the rest was a matter of simple strategy such as Macaulay 's schoolboy would exhibit in the escalade of a snow fort .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 7]: But it was a near thing .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 13]: Five minutes later , and Hozier might have seized the presidency himself .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 13]: And now , as to the night , and the next day .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 14]: Russo and his diminished staff took Philip 's little army as a nucleus .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 21]: Brazil had duly elected Dom Corria , as provided by the statute , and the news spread like wild fire .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 10]: Before morning , the Liberationists were ten thousand strong .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 54]: Before night closed the roads again , the Pesqueira genius wrote to Dom Corria under a flag of truce , and pointed out that he served the _ President _ , not any crank who said he was President , but the honored individual in whom the people of Brazil placed their trust .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 18]: Dom Corria replied in felicitous terms , and , as the newspapers say , the incident ended .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 36]: The navy sulked for a while , because they held that Russo 's treatment of the _ Andorinha _ was not cricket , or baseball , or whatsoever game appeals most to the Brazilian sportsman .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 46]: It was not even professional football , they said ; but an acrimonious discussion was closed by a strong hint from the Treasury that pay-day might be postponed indefinitely if too much were made of a regrettable accident to the guns of the Maceio artillery .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 22]: Meanwhile , Dom Corria , the man who did not forget , was puzzled by two circumstances not of national importance .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 17]: San Benavides , never a demonstrative lover where Carmela was concerned , was a changed man .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 32]: He was severely wounded during the fight , and Carmela nursed him assiduously , but there could be no doubt that he was under her thumb , and would remain there .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 7]: The indications were subtle but unmistakable .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 9]: Carmela even announced the date of their marriage .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 23]: Dom Corria remembered , of course , what San Benavides and his daughter had said when they all met in the ballroom .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 19]: It seemed to him that Salvador was telling the truth and that Carmela was fibbing on that occasion .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 7]: But he let well enough alone .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 11]: It was good for Salvador that he should obey Carmela .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 28]: He blessed them , and remarked that a really `` smart '' wedding would be just the thing to inaugurate the new reign at Rio de Janeiro .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 13]: He was far more perplexed by the untimely wrath of Philip Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 12]: He thought of it for at least five minutes next morning .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 25]: Then he sought Dickey Bulmer , who had just quitted Coke 's bedroom , and was examining the rare shrubs that bordered the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 9]: `` What news of that brave man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 13]: asked Dom Corria , and his deep voice vibrated with real feeling .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 9]: `` First-rate , sir , '' said Dickey .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 18]: `` The bullet is extracted , and the doctor says ` e 'll soon be all right .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 9]: Leastways , that 's wot Iris tells me .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 22]: I ca n't talk Portuguese meself , an ' pore old Jimmie 's langwidge ai n't fit to be repeated . ''
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 4]: The President laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 13]: `` He is what you call a bundle of contradictions , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 11]: -- a rough fellow with the heart of a bull .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 17]: But he saved my life , and that naturally counts for a good deal with me .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 13]: And how is your niece after last night 's terrible experience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 4]: `` My niece ?
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 5]: D'ye mean Iris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 7]: demanded Bulmer , obviously somewhat annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 18]: `` She 's not my niece ; she 's -- '' `` Your grand-daughter , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 18]: That young lady ` as done me the honor of promisin ' to be my wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 14]: said Dom Corria , fixing his brilliant eyes on Bulmer 's vexed face .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 14]: `` There 's no ` Oh ' about it , '' growled Dickey .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 33]: `` It was all cut an ' dried weeks ago , an ' she ` as n't rued of ` er bargain yet , as far as I can make out . ''
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 16]: `` You mean that the marriage was arranged before the _ Andromeda _ sailed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 5]: said Dom Corria gently .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 8]: `` W ` y , of course .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 13]: It could n't very well be fixed after , could it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 10]: `` No -- not as between you and her .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 6]: I can vouch for that .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 47]: Forgive me , Mr. Bulmer -- I have a daughter of marriageable age , you know , and I speak as a parent -- do you think that it is a wise thing for a man of your years to marry a girl of twenty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 13]: `` If I did n't , I would n't do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 9]: `` But may it not be selfish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 9]: Then downright Lancashire took hold of the argument .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 13]: `` Look ` ere , wot are you drivin ' at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 11]: demanded Dickey , now in a white heat of anger .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 15]: He had yet to learn that the President preferred a straight-forward way of talking .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 13]: `` I want you to forego this marriage , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 18]: `` Because that charming girl loves another man , but feels that she is bound to you .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 7]: I understand the position at last .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 24]: Mr. Bulmer , you can not wish to break her heart and drive that fine young fellow , Philip Hozier , to despair .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 4]: Come , now !
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 9]: Let you and me reason this thing together .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 16]: Possibly , when she agreed to marry you she did not know what love is .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 12]: She is high-minded , an idealist , the soul of honor .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 25]: What other woman would have consented to be separated from her friends on Fernando Noronha merely because it increased their meager chances of safety ?
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 42]: How few women , loving a man like Philip Hozier , who is assured of a splendid reward for his services to this State , would resolutely deny the claims of her own heart in order to keep her word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 14]: Bulmer had never heard anyone speak with the crystal directness of Dom Corria .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 19]: Each word chipped away some part of the fence which he had deliberately erected around his own intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 17]: Certain facts had found crevices in the barrier already ; Dom Corria broke down whole sections .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 10]: But he was a hard man , and stubborn .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 20]: Throughout his long life he had not been of yielding habit , and his heart was set on Iris .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 19]: `` You are mighty sure that she is wrapped up in this young spark , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 11]: `` Were I not , I would not have interfered .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 4]: Take my advice .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 8]: First , ask yourself an honest question .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 5]: Then ask the girl .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 4]: She will answer .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 6]: I promise you that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 11]: `` I 'm a rich man , '' persisted Dickey .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 13]: `` Nobody forced ` er , one way or the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 3]: `` Possibly .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 16]: One wonders , though , why she hid herself on the _ Andromeda _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 9]: `` It 's true , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 10]: David said -- '' `` Who is David ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 5]: `` Her uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 23]: `` In England , I take it , if a man wishes to marry a girl he does not woo her uncle .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 7]: Of course , these customs vary .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 25]: Here , in Brazil -- '' Then Bulmer said something about Brazil that was not to be expected from one of his staid demeanor .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 26]: In fact , he regarded Brazil as the cause of the whole trouble , and his opinion concerning that marvelous land coincided with Hozier 's .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 27]: He turned and walked away , looking a trifle older , a trifle more bent , perhaps , than when he came out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 13]: An hour later , Dom Corria and Carmela met in a corridor .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 17]: They were discussing arrangements for a speedy move to the capital when Iris ran into them .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 11]: Her face was flushed , and she had been crying .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 18]: Much to Carmela 's amazement , the English girl clasped her round the neck and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 33]: `` Tell your father , my dear , that he has been very good to me , '' she whispered ; then her face grew scarlet again , and she hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 4]: `` Excellent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 4]: said the President .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 8]: `` That old man is a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 5]: His friend is not .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 10]: Yet they are very much alike in other respects .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 3]: Odd thing !
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 16]: Carmela _ cara _ , can you spare a few minutes from your invalid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 6]: `` Yes , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 14]: `` Go , then , and find that young Englishman , Philip Hozier .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 16]: Tell him that the engagement between Miss Yorke and Mr. Bulmer is broken off . ''
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 6]: Carmela 's black eyes sparkled .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 25]: That wayward blood of hers surged in her veins , but Dom Corria 's calm glance dwelt on her , and the spasm passed .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 10]: `` Yes , father , '' she said dutifully .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 22]: He stroked his chin as he went out to pronounce a funeral oration on those who had fallen during the fight .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 18]: `` I think , '' said he reflectively , `` I think that Carmela dislikes that girl .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 5]: I wonder why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 14]: Philip had never , to his knowledge , seen the Senhora De Sylva .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 44]: Watts spoke of her , remarking that she was `` a reel pleasant young lady , a bit flighty , p ` raps , but , then , ` oo could tell wot any gal would do one minnit from the next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 5]: And that was all .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 54]: It was , therefore , something more than a surprise when the sallow-faced , willowy girl , black-haired , black-eyed , and most demure of manner , whom he remembered to have met in the gateway of Las Flores early on the previous day , came to his tent and asked for him .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 10]: She introduced herself , and Philip was most polite .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 10]: `` My father sent me -- '' she began .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 36]: `` I ought to have waited on the President , '' he said , seeing that she hesitated , `` but several of my men are wounded , and we have so few doctors . ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 21]: She smiled , and Carmela could redeem much of her plainness of feature by the singular charm of her smile .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 13]: `` Dom Corria is a good doctor himself , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 21]: `` His skill will be much appreciated in Brazil at the present moment , '' said he , rather bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 10]: `` He mends broken hearts , '' she persisted .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 9]: `` Ah , a healer , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 6]: but he frowned a little .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 7]: `` He is in demand to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 12]: He asked me to tell you of one most successful operation .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 16]: The -- er -- the engagement between Miss Iris Yorke -- is that the name ?
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 28]: -- and Mr. -- Mr. -- dear me -- '' `` Bulmer , '' scowled Philip , a block of ice in the warm air of Brazil .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 13]: `` Yes , that is it -- well -- it is ended .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 10]: She is free -- for a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 11]: There was a curious bleaching of Philip 's weather-tanned face .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 10]: It touched a chord in Carmela 's impulsive nature .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 10]: `` It is all right , '' she nodded .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 8]: `` You can go to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 19]: She left him there , more shaken than he had ever been by thunderous sea or screaming bullet .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 22]: `` They are cold , these English , '' she communed , as she passed up the slope to the house .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 8]: `` It takes something to rouse them .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 15]: What would he have said were he in Salvador 's place last night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 46]: It did not occur to her that Philip could not possibly have been in Salvador 's place , since God has made as many varieties of men as of berries , whereof some are wholesome and some poisonous , yet they all have their uses .
