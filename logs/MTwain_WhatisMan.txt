Parsing [sent. 1 len. 4]: WHAT IS MAN ?
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 17]: AND OTHER ESSAYS By Mark Twain -LRB- Samuel Langhorne Clemens , 1835-1910 -RRB- WHAT IS MAN ?
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 6]: I a. Man the Machine .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 15]: b. Personal Merit -LRB- The Old Man and the Young Man had been conversing .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 18]: The Old Man had asserted that the human being is merely a machine , and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 21]: The Young Man objected , and asked him to go into particulars and furnish his reasons for his position . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 3]: Old Man .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 11]: What are the materials of which a steam-engine is made ?
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 3]: Young Man .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 12]: Iron , steel , brass , white-metal , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 6]: O.M. Where are these found ?
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 4]: In the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 5]: In a pure state ?
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 6]: Y.M. No -- in ores .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 10]: O.M. Are the metals suddenly deposited in the ores ?
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 12]: Y.M. No -- it is the patient work of countless ages .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 11]: You could make the engine out of the rocks themselves ?
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 10]: Y.M. Yes , a brittle one and not valuable .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 13]: You would not require much , of such an engine as that ?
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 6]: Y.M. No -- substantially nothing .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 14]: O.M. To make a fine and capable engine , how would you proceed ?
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 40]: Y.M. Drive tunnels and shafts into the hills ; blast out the iron ore ; crush it , smelt it , reduce it to pig-iron ; put some of it through the Bessemer process and make steel of it .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 13]: Mine and treat and combine several metals of which brass is made .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 3]: O.M. Then ?
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 12]: Y.M. Out of the perfected result , build the fine engine .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 8]: You would require much of this one ?
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 6]: Y.M. Oh , indeed yes .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 25]: It could drive lathes , drills , planers , punches , polishers , in a word all the cunning machines of a great factory ?
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 3]: It could .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 7]: What could the stone engine do ?
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 12]: Y.M. Drive a sewing-machine , possibly -- nothing more , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 12]: O.M. Men would admire the other engine and rapturously praise it ?
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 6]: But not the stone one ?
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 16]: The merits of the metal machine would be far above those of the stone one ?
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 4]: Y.M. Of course .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 4]: O.M. Personal merits ?
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 4]: Y.M. PERSONAL merits ?
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 5]: How do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 13]: It would be personally entitled to the credit of its own performance ?
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 3]: The engine ?
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 3]: Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 4]: O.M. Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 8]: Y.M. Because its performance is not personal .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 10]: It is the result of the law of construction .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 24]: It is not a MERIT that it does the things which it is set to do -- it ca n't HELP doing them .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 18]: O.M. And it is not a personal demerit in the stone machine that it does so little ?
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 4]: Y.M. Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 20]: It does no more and no less than the law of its make permits and compels it to do .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 12]: There is nothing PERSONAL about it ; it can not choose .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 45]: In this process of `` working up to the matter '' is it your idea to work up to the proposition that man and a machine are about the same thing , and that there is no personal merit in the performance of either ?
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 15]: O.M. Yes -- but do not be offended ; I am meaning no offense .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 14]: What makes the grand difference between the stone engine and the steel one ?
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 8]: Shall we call it training , education ?
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 16]: Shall we call the stone engine a savage and the steel one a civilized man ?
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 44]: The original rock contained the stuff of which the steel one was built -- but along with a lot of sulphur and stone and other obstructing inborn heredities , brought down from the old geologic ages -- prejudices , let us call them .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 18]: Prejudices which nothing within the rock itself had either POWER to remove or any DESIRE to remove .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 8]: Will you take note of that phrase ?
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 26]: I have written it down ; `` Prejudices which nothing within the rock itself had either power to remove or any desire to remove . ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 3]: Go on .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 13]: O.M. Prejudices must be removed by OUTSIDE INFLUENCES or not at all .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 4]: Put that down .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 17]: Y.M. Very well ; `` Must be removed by outside influences or not at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 3]: Go on .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 12]: The iron 's prejudice against ridding itself of the cumbering rock .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 21]: To make it more exact , the iron 's absolute INDIFFERENCE as to whether the rock be removed or not .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 17]: Then comes the OUTSIDE INFLUENCE and grinds the rock to powder and sets the ore free .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 9]: The IRON in the ore is still captive .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 11]: An OUTSIDE INFLUENCE smelts it free of the clogging ore .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 14]: The iron is emancipated iron , now , but indifferent to further progress .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 19]: An OUTSIDE INFLUENCE beguiles it into the Bessemer furnace and refines it into steel of the first quality .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 11]: It is educated , now -- its training is complete .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 7]: And it has reached its limit .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 11]: By no possible process can it be educated into GOLD .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 6]: Will you set that down ?
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 16]: `` Everything has its limit -- iron ore can not be educated into gold . ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 44]: There are gold men , and tin men , and copper men , and leaden mean , and steel men , and so on -- and each has the limitations of his nature , his heredities , his training , and his environment .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 34]: You can build engines out of each of these metals , and they will all perform , but you must not require the weak ones to do equal work with the strong ones .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 31]: In each case , to get the best results , you must free the metal from its obstructing prejudicial ones by education -- smelting , refining , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 8]: You have arrived at man , now ?
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 9]: Man the machine -- man the impersonal engine .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 30]: Whatsoever a man is , is due to his MAKE , and to the INFLUENCES brought to bear upon it by his heredities , his habitat , his associations .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 14]: He is moved , directed , COMMANDED , by EXTERIOR influences -- SOLELY .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 9]: He ORIGINATES nothing , not even a thought .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 5]: Y.M. Oh , come !
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 16]: Where did I get my opinion that this which you are talking is all foolishness ?
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 26]: It is a quite natural opinion -- indeed an inevitable opinion -- but YOU did not create the materials out of which it is formed .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 50]: They are odds and ends of thoughts , impressions , feelings , gathered unconsciously from a thousand books , a thousand conversations , and from streams of thought and feeling which have flowed down into your heart and brain out of the hearts and brains of centuries of ancestors .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 38]: PERSONALLY you did not create even the smallest microscopic fragment of the materials out of which your opinion is made ; and personally you can not claim even the slender merit of PUTTING THE BORROWED MATERIALS TOGETHER .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 22]: That was done AUTOMATICALLY -- by your mental machinery , in strict accordance with the law of that machinery 's construction .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 21]: And you not only did not make that machinery yourself , but you have NOT EVEN ANY COMMAND OVER IT .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 5]: This is too much .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 12]: You think I could have formed no opinion but that one ?
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 3]: O.M. Spontaneously ?
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 27]: And YOU DID NOT FORM THAT ONE ; your machinery did it for you -- automatically and instantly , without reflection or the need of it .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 6]: Y.M. Suppose I had reflected ?
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 3]: How then ?
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 5]: O.M. Suppose you try ?
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 10]: Y.M. -LRB- AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 4]: I have reflected .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 14]: You mean you have tried to change your opinion -- as an experiment ?
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 4]: O.M. With success ?
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 12]: It remains the same ; it is impossible to change it .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 22]: O.M. I am sorry , but you see , yourself , that your mind is merely a machine , nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 22]: You have no command over it , it has no command over itself -- it is worked SOLELY FROM THE OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 16]: That is the law of its make ; it is the law of all machines .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 12]: Y.M. Ca n't I EVER change one of these automatic opinions ?
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 3]: O.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 12]: You ca n't yourself , but EXTERIOR INFLUENCES can do it .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 6]: Y.M. And exterior ones ONLY ?
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 7]: O.M. Yes -- exterior ones only .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 11]: That position is untenable -- I may say ludicrously untenable .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 6]: What makes you think so ?
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 12]: Y.M. I do n't merely think it , I know it .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 31]: Suppose I resolve to enter upon a course of thought , and study , and reading , with the deliberate purpose of changing that opinion ; and suppose I succeed .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 25]: THAT is not the work of an exterior impulse , the whole of it is mine and personal ; for I originated the project .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 7]: O.M. Not a shred of it .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 9]: IT GREW OUT OF THIS TALK WITH ME .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 11]: But for that it would not have occurred to you .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 6]: No man ever originates anything .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 13]: All his thoughts , all his impulses , come FROM THE OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 7]: Y.M. It 's an exasperating subject .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 16]: The FIRST man had original thoughts , anyway ; there was nobody to draw from .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 5]: It is a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 10]: Adam 's thoughts came to him from the outside .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 7]: YOU have a fear of death .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 17]: You did not invent that -- you got it from outside , from talking and teaching .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 12]: Adam had no fear of death -- none in the world .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 6]: Y.M. Yes , he had .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 5]: When he was created ?
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 5]: O.M. When , then ?
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 7]: When he was threatened with it .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 6]: Then it came from OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 17]: Adam is quite big enough ; let us not try to make a god of him .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 16]: NONE BUT GODS HAVE EVER HAD A THOUGHT WHICH DID NOT COME FROM THE OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 26]: Adam probably had a good head , but it was of no sort of use to him until it was filled up FROM THE OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 13]: He was not able to invent the triflingest little thing with it .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 26]: He had not a shadow of a notion of the difference between good and evil -- he had to get the idea FROM THE OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 29]: Neither he nor Eve was able to originate the idea that it was immodest to go naked ; the knowledge came in with the apple FROM THE OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 14]: A man 's brain is so constructed that IT CAN ORIGINATE NOTHING WHATSOEVER .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 8]: It can only use material obtained OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 15]: It is merely a machine ; and it works automatically , not by will-power .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 15]: IT HAS NO COMMAND OVER ITSELF , ITS OWNER HAS NO COMMAND OVER IT .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 22]: Y.M. Well , never mind Adam : but certainly Shakespeare 's creations -- O.M. No , you mean Shakespeare 's IMITATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 4]: Shakespeare created nothing .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 9]: He correctly observed , and he marvelously painted .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 15]: He exactly portrayed people whom GOD had created ; but he created none himself .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 12]: Let us spare him the slander of charging him with trying .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 5]: Shakespeare could not create .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 11]: HE WAS A MACHINE , AND MACHINES DO NOT CREATE .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 8]: Y.M. Where WAS his excellence , then ?
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 3]: In this .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 17]: He was not a sewing-machine , like you and me ; he was a Gobelin loom .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 69]: The threads and the colors came into him FROM THE OUTSIDE ; outside influences , suggestions , EXPERIENCES -LRB- reading , seeing plays , playing plays , borrowing ideas , and so on -RRB- , framed the patterns in his mind and started up his complex and admirable machinery , and IT AUTOMATICALLY turned out that pictured and gorgeous fabric which still compels the astonishment of the world .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 67]: If Shakespeare had been born and bred on a barren and unvisited rock in the ocean his mighty intellect would have had no OUTSIDE MATERIAL to work with , and could have invented none ; and NO OUTSIDE INFLUENCES , teachings , moldings , persuasions , inspirations , of a valuable sort , and could have invented none ; and so Shakespeare would have produced nothing .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 23]: In Turkey he would have produced something -- something up to the highest limit of Turkish influences , associations , and training .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 22]: In France he would have produced something better -- something up to the highest limit of the French influences and training .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 25]: In England he rose to the highest limit attainable through the OUTSIDE HELPS AFFORDED BY THAT LAND 'S IDEALS , INFLUENCES , AND TRAINING .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 7]: You and I are but sewing-machines .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 29]: We must turn out what we can ; we must do our endeavor and care nothing at all when the unthinking reproach us for not turning out Gobelins .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 8]: Y.M. And so we are mere machines !
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 25]: And machines may not boast , nor feel proud of their performance , nor claim personal merit for it , nor applause and praise .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 6]: It is an infamous doctrine .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 12]: It is n't a doctrine , it is merely a fact .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 20]: Y.M. I suppose , then , there is no more merit in being brave than in being a coward ?
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 4]: O.M. PERSONAL merit ?
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 9]: A brave man does not CREATE his bravery .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 11]: He is entitled to no personal credit for possessing it .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 6]: It is born to him .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 16]: A baby born with a billion dollars -- where is the personal merit in that ?
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 14]: A baby born with nothing -- where is the personal demerit in that ?
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 27]: The one is fawned upon , admired , worshiped , by sycophants , the other is neglected and despised -- where is the sense in it ?
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 20]: Y.M. Sometimes a timid man sets himself the task of conquering his cowardice and becoming brave -- and succeeds .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 7]: What do you say to that ?
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 16]: That it shows the value of TRAINING IN RIGHT DIRECTIONS OVER TRAINING IN WRONG ONES .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 22]: Inestimably valuable is training , influence , education , in right directions -- TRAINING ONE 'S SELF-APPROBATION TO ELEVATE ITS IDEALS .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 17]: But as to merit -- the personal merit of the victorious coward 's project and achievement ?
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 5]: There is n't any .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 31]: In the world 's view he is a worthier man than he was before , but HE did n't achieve the change -- the merit of it is not his .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 5]: Y.M. Whose , then ?
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 15]: O.M. His MAKE , and the influences which wrought upon it from the outside .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 4]: Y.M. His make ?
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 25]: O.M. To start with , he was NOT utterly and completely a coward , or the influences would have had nothing to work upon .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 26]: He was not afraid of a cow , though perhaps of a bull : not afraid of a woman , but afraid of a man .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 7]: There was something to build upon .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 5]: There was a SEED .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 6]: No seed , no plant .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 14]: Did he make that seed himself , or was it born in him ?
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 12]: It was no merit of HIS that the seed was there .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 25]: Y.M. Well , anyway , the idea of CULTIVATING it , the resolution to cultivate it , was meritorious , and he originated that .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 7]: He did nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 15]: It came whence ALL impulses , good or bad , come -- from OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 80]: If that timid man had lived all his life in a community of human rabbits , had never read of brave deeds , had never heard speak of them , had never heard any one praise them nor express envy of the heroes that had done them , he would have had no more idea of bravery than Adam had of modesty , and it could never by any possibility have occurred to him to RESOLVE to become brave .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 17]: He COULD NOT ORIGINATE THE IDEA -- it had to come to him from the OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 17]: And so , when he heard bravery extolled and cowardice derided , it woke him up .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 4]: He was ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 21]: Perhaps his sweetheart turned up her nose and said , `` I am told that you are a coward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 17]: It was not HE that turned over the new leaf -- she did it for him .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 16]: HE must not strut around in the merit of it -- it is not his .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 15]: Y.M. But , anyway , he reared the plant after she watered the seed .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 3]: O.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 5]: OUTSIDE INFLUENCES reared it .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 29]: At the command -- and trembling -- he marched out into the field -- with other soldiers and in the daytime , not alone and in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 44]: He had the INFLUENCE OF EXAMPLE , he drew courage from his comrades ' courage ; he was afraid , and wanted to run , but he did not dare ; he was AFRAID to run , with all those soldiers looking on .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 22]: He was progressing , you see -- the moral fear of shame had risen superior to the physical fear of harm .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 71]: By the end of the campaign experience will have taught him that not ALL who go into battle get hurt -- an outside influence which will be helpful to him ; and he will also have learned how sweet it is to be praised for courage and be huzza 'd at with tear-choked voices as the war-worn regiment marches past the worshiping multitude with flags flying and the drums beating .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 40]: After that he will be as securely brave as any veteran in the army -- and there will not be a shade nor suggestion of PERSONAL MERIT in it anywhere ; it will all have come from the OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 30]: The Victoria Cross breeds more heroes than -- Y.M. Hang it , where is the sense in his becoming brave if he is to get no credit for it ?
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 8]: O.M. Your question will answer itself presently .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 17]: It involves an important detail of man 's make which we have not yet touched upon .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 5]: What detail is that ?
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 23]: The impulse which moves a person to do things -- the only impulse that ever moves a person to do a thing .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 4]: The ONLY one !
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 5]: Is there but one ?
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 4]: That is all .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 5]: There is only one .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 11]: Y.M. Well , certainly that is a strange enough doctrine .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 15]: What is the sole impulse that ever moves a person to do a thing ?
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 20]: The impulse to CONTENT HIS OWN SPIRIT -- the NECESSITY of contenting his own spirit and WINNING ITS APPROVAL .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 10]: Y.M. Oh , come , that wo n't do !
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 6]: O.M. Why wo n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 42]: Y.M. Because it puts him in the attitude of always looking out for his own comfort and advantage ; whereas an unselfish man often does a thing solely for another person 's good when it is a positive disadvantage to himself .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 5]: It is a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 16]: The act must do HIM good , FIRST ; otherwise he will not do it .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 42]: He may THINK he is doing it solely for the other person 's sake , but it is not so ; he is contenting his own spirit first -- the other 's person 's benefit has to always take SECOND place .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 5]: What a fantastic idea !
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 5]: What becomes of self-sacrifice ?
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 5]: Please answer me that .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 4]: What is self-sacrifice ?
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 22]: The doing good to another person where no shadow nor suggestion of benefit to one 's self can result from it .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 15]: II Man 's Sole Impulse -- the Securing of His Own Approval Old Man .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 10]: There have been instances of it -- you think ?
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 3]: Young Man .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 2]: INSTANCES ?
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 4]: Millions of them !
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 7]: You have not jumped to conclusions ?
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 7]: You have examined them -- critically ?
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 17]: They do n't need it : the acts themselves reveal the golden impulse back of them .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 4]: O.M. For instance ?
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 8]: Y.M. Well , then , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 8]: Take the case in the book here .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 7]: The man lives three miles up-town .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 10]: It is bitter cold , snowing hard , midnight .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 35]: He is about to enter the horse-car when a gray and ragged old woman , a touching picture of misery , puts out her lean hand and begs for rescue from hunger and death .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 29]: The man finds that he has a quarter in his pocket , but he does not hesitate : he gives it her and trudges home through the storm .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 24]: There -- it is noble , it is beautiful ; its grace is marred by no fleck or blemish or suggestion of self-interest .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 6]: What makes you think that ?
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 8]: Y.M. Pray what else could I think ?
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 14]: Do you imagine that there is some other way of looking at it ?
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 21]: O.M. Can you put yourself in the man 's place and tell me what he felt and what he thought ?
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 3]: Y.M. Easily .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 16]: The sight of that suffering old face pierced his generous heart with a sharp pain .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 6]: He could not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 35]: He could endure the three-mile walk in the storm , but he could not endure the tortures his conscience would suffer if he turned his back and left that poor old creature to perish .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 14]: He would not have been able to sleep , for thinking of it .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 11]: What was his state of mind on his way home ?
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 12]: It was a state of joy which only the self-sacrificer knows .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 11]: His heart sang , he was unconscious of the storm .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 4]: He felt well ?
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 6]: One can not doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 4]: O.M. Very well .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 18]: Now let us add up the details and see how much he got for his twenty-five cents .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 15]: Let us try to find out the REAL why of his making the investment .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 18]: In the first place HE could n't bear the pain which the old suffering face gave him .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 12]: So he was thinking of HIS pain -- this good man .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 8]: He must buy a salve for it .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 18]: If he did not succor the old woman HIS conscience would torture him all the way home .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 6]: Thinking of HIS pain again .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 7]: He must buy relief for that .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 15]: If he did n't relieve the old woman HE would not get any sleep .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 14]: He must buy some sleep -- still thinking of HIMSELF , you see .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 43]: Thus , to sum up , he bought himself free of a sharp pain in his heart , he bought himself free of the tortures of a waiting conscience , he bought a whole night 's sleep -- all for twenty-five cents !
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 9]: It should make Wall Street ashamed of itself .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 19]: On his way home his heart was joyful , and it sang -- profit on top of profit !
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 27]: The impulse which moved the man to succor the old woman was -- FIRST -- to CONTENT HIS OWN SPIRIT ; secondly to relieve HER sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 25]: Is it your opinion that men 's acts proceed from one central and unchanging and inalterable impulse , or from a variety of impulses ?
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 18]: Y.M. From a variety , of course -- some high and fine and noble , others not .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 5]: What is your opinion ?
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 10]: Then there is but ONE law , one source .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 14]: That both the noblest impulses and the basest proceed from that one source ?
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 9]: Y.M. Will you put that law into words ?
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 11]: This is the law , keep it in your mind .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 35]: FROM HIS CRADLE TO HIS GRAVE A MAN NEVER DOES A SINGLE THING WHICH HAS ANY FIRST AND FOREMOST OBJECT BUT ONE -- TO SECURE PEACE OF MIND , SPIRITUAL COMFORT , FOR HIMSELF .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 3]: Y.M. Come !
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 15]: He never does anything for any one else 's comfort , spiritual or physical ?
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 3]: O.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 16]: EXCEPT ON THOSE DISTINCT TERMS -- that it shall FIRST secure HIS OWN spiritual comfort .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 7]: Otherwise he will not do it .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 12]: It will be easy to expose the falsity of that proposition .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 4]: O.M. For instance ?
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 12]: Y.M. Take that noble passion , love of country , patriotism .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 34]: A man who loves peace and dreads pain , leaves his pleasant home and his weeping family and marches out to manfully expose himself to hunger , cold , wounds , and death .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 6]: Is that seeking spiritual comfort ?
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 7]: He loves peace and dreads pain ?
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 23]: Then perhaps there is something that he loves MORE than he loves peace -- THE APPROVAL OF HIS NEIGHBORS AND THE PUBLIC .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 23]: And perhaps there is something which he dreads more than he dreads pain -- the DISAPPROVAL of his neighbors and the public .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 41]: If he is sensitive to shame he will go to the field -- not because his spirit will be ENTIRELY comfortable there , but because it will be more comfortable there than it would be if he remained at home .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 25]: He will always do the thing which will bring him the MOST mental comfort -- for that is THE SOLE LAW OF HIS LIFE .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 28]: He leaves the weeping family behind ; he is sorry to make them uncomfortable , but not sorry enough to sacrifice his OWN comfort to secure theirs .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 23]: Y.M. Do you really believe that mere public opinion could force a timid and peaceful man to -- O.M. Go to war ?
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 12]: Yes -- public opinion can force some men to do ANYTHING .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 3]: Y.M. ANYTHING ?
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 5]: O.M. Yes -- anything .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 7]: Y.M. I do n't believe that .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 12]: Can it force a right-principled man to do a wrong thing ?
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 13]: Y.M. Can it force a kind man to do a cruel thing ?
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 5]: Y.M. Give an instance .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 9]: O.M. Alexander Hamilton was a conspicuously high-principled man .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 26]: He regarded dueling as wrong , and as opposed to the teachings of religion -- but in deference to PUBLIC OPINION he fought a duel .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 39]: He deeply loved his family , but to buy public approval he treacherously deserted them and threw his life away , ungenerously leaving them to lifelong sorrow in order that he might stand well with a foolish world .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 27]: In the then condition of the public standards of honor he could not have been comfortable with the stigma upon him of having refused to fight .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 35]: The teachings of religion , his devotion to his family , his kindness of heart , his high principles , all went for nothing when they stood in the way of his spiritual comfort .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 38]: A man will do ANYTHING , no matter what it is , TO SECURE HIS SPIRITUAL COMFORT ; and he can neither be forced nor persuaded to any act which has not that goal for its object .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 39]: Hamilton 's act was compelled by the inborn necessity of contenting his own spirit ; in this it was like all the other acts of his life , and like all the acts of all men 's lives .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 11]: Do you see where the kernel of the matter lies ?
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 11]: A man can not be comfortable without HIS OWN approval .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 17]: He will secure the largest share possible of that , at all costs , all sacrifices .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 14]: A minute ago you said Hamilton fought that duel to get PUBLIC approval .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 4]: O.M. I did .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 72]: By refusing to fight the duel he would have secured his family 's approval and a large share of his own ; but the public approval was more valuable in his eyes than all other approvals put together -- in the earth or above it ; to secure that would furnish him the MOST comfort of mind , the most SELF-approval ; so he sacrificed all other values to get it .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 17]: Some noble souls have refused to fight duels , and have manfully braved the public contempt .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 7]: They acted ACCORDING TO THEIR MAKE .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 15]: They valued their principles and the approval of their families ABOVE the public approval .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 13]: They took the thing they valued MOST and let the rest go .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 20]: They took what would give them the LARGEST share of PERSONAL CONTENTMENT AND APPROVAL -- a man ALWAYS does .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 15]: Public opinion can not force that kind of men to go to the wars .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 9]: When they go it is for other reasons .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 4]: Other spirit-contenting reasons .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 5]: Y.M. Always spirit-contenting reasons ?
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 5]: There are no others .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 22]: When a man sacrifices his life to save a little child from a burning building , what do you call that ?
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 13]: When he does it , it is the law of HIS make .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 35]: HE ca n't bear to see the child in that peril -LRB- a man of a different make COULD -RRB- , and so he tries to save the child , and loses his life .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 13]: But he has got what he was after -- HIS OWN APPROVAL .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 18]: What do you call Love , Hate , Charity , Revenge , Humanity , Magnanimity , Forgiveness ?
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 18]: O.M. Different results of the one Master Impulse : the necessity of securing one 's self approval .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 26]: They wear diverse clothes and are subject to diverse moods , but in whatsoever ways they masquerade they are the SAME PERSON all the time .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 31]: To change the figure , the COMPULSION that moves a man -- and there is but the one -- is the necessity of securing the contentment of his own spirit .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 9]: When it stops , the man is dead .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 4]: That is foolishness .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 19]: Love -- O.M. Why , love is that impulse , that law , in its most uncompromising form .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 11]: It will squander life and everything else on its object .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 13]: Not PRIMARILY for the object 's sake , but for ITS OWN .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 18]: When its object is happy IT is happy -- and that is what it is unconsciously after .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 13]: You do not even except the lofty and gracious passion of mother-love ?
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 12]: O.M. No , IT is the absolute slave of that law .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 33]: The mother will go naked to clothe her child ; she will starve that it may have food ; suffer torture to save it from pain ; die that it may live .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 10]: She takes a living PLEASURE in making these sacrifices .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 19]: SHE DOES IT FOR THAT REWARD -- that self-approval , that contentment , that peace , that comfort .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 15]: SHE WOULD DO IT FOR YOUR CHILD IF SHE COULD GET THE SAME PAY .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 8]: This is an infernal philosophy of yours .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 11]: It is n't a philosophy , it is a fact .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 16]: Y.M. Of course you must admit that there are some acts which -- O.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 33]: There is NO act , large or small , fine or mean , which springs from any motive but the one -- the necessity of appeasing and contenting one 's own spirit .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 43]: The world 's philanthropists -- O.M. I honor them , I uncover my head to them -- from habit and training ; and THEY could not know comfort or happiness or self-approval if they did not work and spend for the unfortunate .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 26]: It makes THEM happy to see others happy ; and so with money and labor they buy what they are after -- HAPPINESS , SELF-APPROVAL .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 9]: Why do n't miners do the same thing ?
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 13]: Because they can get a thousandfold more happiness by NOT doing it .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 6]: There is no other reason .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 8]: They follow the law of their make .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 11]: What do you say of duty for duty 's sake ?
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 6]: That IS DOES NOT EXIST .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 19]: Duties are not performed for duty 's SAKE , but because their NEGLECT would make the man UNCOMFORTABLE .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 23]: A man performs but ONE duty -- the duty of contenting his spirit , the duty of making himself agreeable to himself .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 38]: If he can most satisfyingly perform this sole and only duty by HELPING his neighbor , he will do it ; if he can most satisfyingly perform it by SWINDLING his neighbor , he will do it .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 20]: But he always looks out for Number One -- FIRST ; the effects upon others are a SECONDARY matter .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 28]: Men pretend to self-sacrifices , but this is a thing which , in the ordinary value of the phrase , DOES NOT EXIST AND HAS NOT EXISTED .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 44]: A man often honestly THINKS he is sacrificing himself merely and solely for some one else , but he is deceived ; his bottom impulse is to content a requirement of his nature and training , and thus acquire peace for his soul .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 22]: Y.M. Apparently , then , all men , both good and bad ones , devote their lives to contenting their consciences .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 30]: That is a good enough name for it : Conscience -- that independent Sovereign , that insolent absolute Monarch inside of a man who is the man 's Master .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 15]: There are all kinds of consciences , because there are all kinds of men .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 29]: You satisfy an assassin 's conscience in one way , a philanthropist 's in another , a miser 's in another , a burglar 's in still another .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 31]: As a GUIDE or INCENTIVE to any authoritatively prescribed line of morals or conduct -LRB- leaving TRAINING out of the account -RRB- , a man 's conscience is totally valueless .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 40]: I know a kind-hearted Kentuckian whose self-approval was lacking -- whose conscience was troubling him , to phrase it with exactness -- BECAUSE HE HAD NEGLECTED TO KILL A CERTAIN MAN -- a man whom he had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 28]: The stranger had killed this man 's friend in a fight , this man 's Kentucky training made it a duty to kill the stranger for it .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 27]: He neglected his duty -- kept dodging it , shirking it , putting it off , and his unrelenting conscience kept persecuting him for this conduct .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 23]: At last , to get ease of mind , comfort , self-approval , he hunted up the stranger and took his life .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 47]: It was an immense act of SELF-SACRIFICE -LRB- as per the usual definition -RRB- , for he did not want to do it , and he never would have done it if he could have bought a contented spirit and an unworried mind at smaller cost .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 20]: But we are so made that we will pay ANYTHING for that contentment -- even another man 's life .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 9]: You spoke a moment ago of TRAINED consciences .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 15]: You mean that we are not BORN with consciences competent to guide us aright ?
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 21]: If we were , children and savages would know right from wrong , and not have to be taught it .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 6]: But consciences can be TRAINED ?
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 14]: Y.M. Of course by parents , teachers , the pulpit , and books .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 14]: O.M. Yes -- they do their share ; they do what they can .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 41]: Y.M. And the rest is done by -- O.M. Oh , a million unnoticed influences -- for good or bad : influences which work without rest during every waking moment of a man 's life , from cradle to grave .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 5]: You have tabulated these ?
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 6]: Many of them -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 8]: Y.M. Will you read me the result ?
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 6]: O.M. Another time , yes .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 6]: It would take an hour .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 12]: A conscience can be trained to shun evil and prefer good ?
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 8]: But will it for spirit-contenting reasons only ?
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 14]: It CA N'T be trained to do a thing for any OTHER reason .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 5]: The thing is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 15]: There MUST be a genuinely and utterly self-sacrificing act recorded in human history somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 4]: You are young .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 7]: You have many years before you .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 4]: Search one out .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 32]: It does seem to me that when a man sees a fellow-being struggling in the water and jumps in at the risk of his life to save him -- O.M. Wait .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 4]: Describe the MAN .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 4]: Describe the FELLOW-BEING .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 14]: State if there is an AUDIENCE present ; or if they are ALONE .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 11]: What have these things to do with the splendid act ?
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 4]: O.M. Very much .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 22]: Shall we suppose , as a beginning , that the two are alone , in a solitary place , at midnight ?
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 4]: If you choose .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 11]: O.M. And that the fellow-being is the man 's daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 10]: Y.M. Well , n-no -- make it someone else .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 8]: A filthy , drunken ruffian , then ?
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 4]: Y.M. I see .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 4]: Circumstances alter cases .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 20]: I suppose that if there was no audience to observe the act , the man would n't perform it .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 11]: But there is here and there a man who WOULD .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 53]: People , for instance , like the man who lost his life trying to save the child from the fire ; and the man who gave the needy old woman his twenty-five cents and walked home in the storm -- there are here and there men like that who would do it .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 3]: And why ?
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 20]: Because they could n't BEAR to see a fellow-being struggling in the water and not jump in and help .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 6]: It would give THEM pain .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 9]: They would save the fellow-being on that account .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 7]: THEY WOULD N'T DO IT OTHERWISE .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 12]: They strictly obey the law which I have been insisting upon .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 18]: You must remember and always distinguish the people who CA N'T BEAR things from people who CAN .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 14]: It will throw light upon a number of apparently `` self-sacrificing '' cases .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 11]: Y.M. Oh , dear , it 's all so disgusting .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 4]: And so true .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 24]: Y.M. Come -- take the good boy who does things he does n't want to do , in order to gratify his mother .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 15]: He does seven-tenths of the act because it gratifies HIM to gratify his mother .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 18]: Throw the bulk of advantage the other way and the good boy would not do the act .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 7]: He MUST obey the iron law .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 5]: None can escape it .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 14]: Y.M. Well , take the case of a bad boy who -- O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 13]: You need n't mention it , it is a waste of time .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 11]: It is no matter about the bad boy 's act .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 12]: Whatever it was , he had a spirit-contenting reason for it .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 13]: Otherwise you have been misinformed , and he did n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 5]: It is very exasperating .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 27]: A while ago you said that man 's conscience is not a born judge of morals and conduct , but has to be taught and trained .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 64]: Now I think a conscience can get drowsy and lazy , but I do n't think it can go wrong ; if you wake it up -- A Little Story O.M. I will tell you a little story : Once upon a time an Infidel was guest in the house of a Christian widow whose little boy was ill and near to death .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 49]: The Infidel often watched by the bedside and entertained the boy with talk , and he used these opportunities to satisfy a strong longing in his nature -- that desire which is in us all to better other people 's condition by having them think as we think .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 4]: He was successful .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 36]: But the dying boy , in his last moments , reproached him and said : `` I BELIEVED , AND WAS HAPPY IN IT ; YOU HAVE TAKEN MY BELIEF AWAY , AND MY COMFORT .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 32]: NOW I HAVE NOTHING LEFT , AND I DIE MISERABLE ; FOR THE THINGS WHICH YOU HAVE TOLD ME DO NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF THAT WHICH I HAVE LOST . ''
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 26]: And the mother , also , reproached the Infidel , and said : `` MY CHILD IS FOREVER LOST , AND MY HEART IS BROKEN .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 8]: HOW COULD YOU DO THIS CRUEL THING ?
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 33]: WE HAVE DONE YOU NO HARM , BUT ONLY KINDNESS ; WE MADE OUR HOUSE YOUR HOME , YOU WERE WELCOME TO ALL WE HAD , AND THIS IS OUR REWARD . ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 39]: The heart of the Infidel was filled with remorse for what he had done , and he said : `` IT WAS WRONG -- I SEE IT NOW ; BUT I WAS ONLY TRYING TO DO HIM GOOD .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 19]: IN MY VIEW HE WAS IN ERROR ; IT SEEMED MY DUTY TO TEACH HIM THE TRUTH . ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 35]: Then the mother said : `` I HAD TAUGHT HIM , ALL HIS LITTLE LIFE , WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE TRUTH , AND IN HIS BELIEVING FAITH BOTH OF US WERE HAPPY .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 14]: NOW HE IS DEAD , -- AND LOST ; AND I AM MISERABLE .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 25]: OUR FAITH CAME DOWN TO US THROUGH CENTURIES OF BELIEVING ANCESTORS ; WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU , OR ANY ONE , TO DISTURB IT ?
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 11]: WHERE WAS YOUR HONOR , WHERE WAS YOUR SHAME ? ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 9]: He was a miscreant , and deserved death !
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 9]: He thought so himself , and said so .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 11]: Y.M. Ah -- you see , HIS CONSCIENCE WAS AWAKENED !
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 7]: O.M. Yes , his Self-Disapproval was .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 9]: It PAINED him to see the mother suffer .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 13]: He was sorry he had done a thing which brought HIM pain .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 30]: It did not occur to him to think of the mother when he was misteaching the boy , for he was absorbed in providing PLEASURE for himself , then .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 14]: Providing it by satisfying what he believed to be a call of duty .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 17]: Y.M. Call it what you please , it is to me a case of AWAKENED CONSCIENCE .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 14]: That awakened conscience could never get itself into that species of trouble again .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 9]: A cure like that is a PERMANENT cure .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 10]: O.M. Pardon -- I had not finished the story .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 12]: We are creatures of OUTSIDE INFLUENCES -- we originate NOTHING within .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 28]: Whenever we take a new line of thought and drift into a new line of belief and action , the impulse is ALWAYS suggested from the OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 40]: Remorse so preyed upon the Infidel that it dissolved his harshness toward the boy 's religion and made him come to regard it with tolerance , next with kindness , for the boy 's sake and the mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 7]: Finally he found himself examining it .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 14]: From that moment his progress in his new trend was steady and rapid .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 6]: He became a believing Christian .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 21]: And now his remorse for having robbed the dying boy of his faith and his salvation was bitterer than ever .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 9]: It gave him no rest , no peace .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 14]: He MUST have rest and peace -- it is the law of nature .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 18]: There seemed but one way to get it ; he must devote himself to saving imperiled souls .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 5]: He became a missionary .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 10]: He landed in a pagan country ill and helpless .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 16]: A native widow took him into her humble home and nursed him back to convalescence .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 18]: Then her young boy was taken hopelessly ill , and the grateful missionary helped her tend him .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 35]: Here was his first opportunity to repair a part of the wrong done to the other boy by doing a precious service for this one by undermining his foolish faith in his false gods .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 4]: He was successful .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 34]: But the dying boy in his last moments reproached him and said : `` I BELIEVED , AND WAS HAPPY IN IT ; YOU HAVE TAKEN MY BELIEF AWAY , AND MY COMFORT .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 32]: NOW I HAVE NOTHING LEFT , AND I DIE MISERABLE ; FOR THE THINGS WHICH YOU HAVE TOLD ME DO NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF THAT WHICH I HAVE LOST . ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 26]: And the mother , also , reproached the missionary , and said : `` MY CHILD IS FOREVER LOST , AND MY HEART IS BROKEN .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 8]: HOW COULD YOU DO THIS CRUEL THING ?
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 33]: WE HAD DONE YOU NO HARM , BUT ONLY KINDNESS ; WE MADE OUR HOUSE YOUR HOME , YOU WERE WELCOME TO ALL WE HAD , AND THIS IS OUR REWARD . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 39]: The heart of the missionary was filled with remorse for what he had done , and he said : `` IT WAS WRONG -- I SEE IT NOW ; BUT I WAS ONLY TRYING TO DO HIM GOOD .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 19]: IN MY VIEW HE WAS IN ERROR ; IT SEEMED MY DUTY TO TEACH HIM THE TRUTH . ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 35]: Then the mother said : `` I HAD TAUGHT HIM , ALL HIS LITTLE LIFE , WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE TRUTH , AND IN HIS BELIEVING FAITH BOTH OF US WERE HAPPY .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 13]: NOW HE IS DEAD -- AND LOST ; AND I AM MISERABLE .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 25]: OUR FAITH CAME DOWN TO US THROUGH CENTURIES OF BELIEVING ANCESTORS ; WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU , OR ANY ONE , TO DISTURB IT ?
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 11]: WHERE WAS YOUR HONOR , WHERE WAS YOUR SHAME ? ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 29]: The missionary 's anguish of remorse and sense of treachery were as bitter and persecuting and unappeasable , now , as they had been in the former case .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 5]: The story is finished .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 5]: What is your comment ?
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 8]: The man 's conscience is a fool !
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 4]: It was morbid .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 8]: It did n't know right from wrong .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 11]: O.M. I am not sorry to hear you say that .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 26]: If you grant that ONE man 's conscience does n't know right from wrong , it is an admission that there are others like it .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 15]: This single admission pulls down the whole doctrine of infallibility of judgment in consciences .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 12]: Meantime there is one thing which I ask you to notice .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 4]: What is that ?
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 29]: That in both cases the man 's ACT gave him no spiritual discomfort , and that he was quite satisfied with it and got pleasure out of it .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 14]: But afterward when it resulted in PAIN to HIM , he was sorry .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 24]: Sorry it had inflicted pain upon the others , BUT FOR NO REASON UNDER THE SUN EXCEPT THAT THEIR PAIN GAVE HIM PAIN .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 22]: Our consciences take NO notice of pain inflicted upon others until it reaches a point where it gives pain to US .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 21]: In ALL cases without exception we are absolutely indifferent to another person 's pain until his sufferings make us uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 15]: Many an infidel would not have been troubled by that Christian mother 's distress .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 6]: Do n't you believe that ?
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 13]: You might almost say it of the AVERAGE infidel , I think .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 45]: O.M. And many a missionary , sternly fortified by his sense of duty , would not have been troubled by the pagan mother 's distress -- Jesuit missionaries in Canada in the early French times , for instance ; see episodes quoted by Parkman .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 7]: Y.M. Well , let us adjourn .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 5]: Where have we arrived ?
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 3]: At this .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 21]: That we -LRB- mankind -RRB- have ticketed ourselves with a number of qualities to which we have given misleading names .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 16]: Love , Hate , Charity , Compassion , Avarice , Benevolence , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 10]: I mean we attach misleading MEANINGS to the names .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 24]: They are all forms of self-contentment , self-gratification , but the names so disguise them that they distract our attention from the fact .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 20]: Also we have smuggled a word into the dictionary which ought not to be there at all -- Self-Sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 9]: It describes a thing which does not exist .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 40]: But worst of all , we ignore and never mention the Sole Impulse which dictates and compels a man 's every act : the imperious necessity of securing his own approval , in every emergency and at all costs .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 9]: To it we owe all that we are .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 11]: It is our breath , our heart , our blood .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 22]: It is our only spur , our whip , our goad , our only impelling power ; we have no other .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 29]: Without it we should be mere inert images , corpses ; no one would do anything , there would be no progress , the world would stand still .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 16]: We ought to stand reverently uncovered when the name of that stupendous power is uttered .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 6]: Y.M. I am not convinced .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 7]: You will be when you think .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 7]: III Instances in Point Old Man .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 13]: Have you given thought to the Gospel of Self-Approval since we talked ?
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 3]: Young Man .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 3]: I have .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 9]: It was I that moved you to it .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 20]: That is to say an OUTSIDE INFLUENCE moved you to it -- not one that originated in your head .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 13]: Will you try to keep that in mind and not forget it ?
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 37]: O.M. Because by and by in one of our talks , I wish to further impress upon you that neither you , nor I , nor any man ever originates a thought in his own head .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 11]: THE UTTERER OF A THOUGHT ALWAYS UTTERS A SECOND-HAND ONE .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 8]: Y.M. Oh , now -- O.M. Wait .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 20]: Reserve your remark till we get to that part of our discussion -- tomorrow or next day , say .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 27]: Now , then , have you been considering the proposition that no act is ever born of any but a self-contenting impulse -- -LRB- primarily -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 4]: You have sought .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 5]: What have you found ?
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 8]: Y.M. I have not been very fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 25]: I have examined many fine and apparently self-sacrificing deeds in romances and biographies , but -- O.M. Under searching analysis the ostensible self-sacrifice disappeared ?
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 4]: It naturally would .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 12]: But here in this novel is one which seems to promise .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 22]: In the Adirondack woods is a wage-earner and lay preacher in the lumber-camps who is of noble character and deeply religious .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 27]: An earnest and practical laborer in the New York slums comes up there on vacation -- he is leader of a section of the University Settlement .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 28]: Holme , the lumberman , is fired with a desire to throw away his excellent worldly prospects and go down and save souls on the East Side .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 20]: He counts it happiness to make this sacrifice for the glory of God and for the cause of Christ .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 39]: He resigns his place , makes the sacrifice cheerfully , and goes to the East Side and preaches Christ and Him crucified every day and every night to little groups of half-civilized foreign paupers who scoff at him .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 19]: But he rejoices in the scoffings , since he is suffering them in the great cause of Christ .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 34]: You have so filled my mind with suspicions that I was constantly expecting to find a hidden questionable impulse back of all this , but I am thankful to say I have failed .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 21]: This man saw his duty , and for DUTY 'S SAKE he sacrificed self and assumed the burden it imposed .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 10]: O.M. Is that as far as you have read ?
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 8]: O.M. Let us read further , presently .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 37]: Meantime , in sacrificing himself -- NOT for the glory of God , PRIMARILY , as HE imagined , but FIRST to content that exacting and inflexible master within him -- DID HE SACRIFICE ANYBODY ELSE ?
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 6]: Y.M. How do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 16]: He relinquished a lucrative post and got mere food and lodging in place of it .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 4]: Had he dependents ?
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 5]: Y.M. Well -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 13]: In what way and to what extend did his self-sacrifice affect THEM ?
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 9]: He was the support of a superannuated father .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 29]: He had a young sister with a remarkable voice -- he was giving her a musical education , so that her longing to be self-supporting might be gratified .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 24]: He was furnishing the money to put a young brother through a polytechnic school and satisfy his desire to become a civil engineer .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 9]: The old father 's comforts were now curtailed ?
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 4]: Y.M. Quite seriously .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 8]: The sister 's music-lessens had to stop ?
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 36]: The young brother 's education -- well , an extinguishing blight fell upon that happy dream , and he had to go to sawing wood to support the old father , or something like that ?
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 6]: It is about what happened .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 10]: What a handsome job of self-sacrificing he did do !
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 11]: It seems to me that he sacrificed everybody EXCEPT himself .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 72]: Have n't I told you that no man EVER sacrifices himself ; that there is no instance of it upon record anywhere ; and that when a man 's Interior Monarch requires a thing of its slave for either its MOMENTARY or its PERMANENT contentment , that thing must and will be furnished and that command obeyed , no matter who may stand in the way and suffer disaster by it ?
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 20]: That man RUINED HIS FAMILY to please and content his Interior Monarch -- Y.M. And help Christ 's cause .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 5]: O.M. Yes -- SECONDLY .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 3]: Not firstly .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 6]: HE thought it was firstly .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 12]: Y.M. Very well , have it so , if you will .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 20]: But it could be that he argued that if he saved a hundred souls in New York -- O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 23]: The sacrifice of the FAMILY would be justified by that great profit upon the -- the -- what shall we call it ?
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 3]: Y.M. Investment ?
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 3]: O.M. Hardly .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 5]: How would SPECULATION do ?
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 5]: How would GAMBLE do ?
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 7]: Not a solitary soul-capture was sure .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 8]: He played for a possible thirty-three-hundred-per-cent profit .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 12]: It was GAMBLING -- with his family for `` chips . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 10]: However let us see how the game came out .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 40]: Maybe we can get on the track of the secret original impulse , the REAL impulse , that moved him to so nobly self-sacrifice his family in the Savior 's cause under the superstition that he was sacrificing himself .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 13]: I will read a chapter or so ... Here we have it !
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 10]: It was bound to expose itself sooner or later .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 33]: He preached to the East-Side rabble a season , then went back to his old dull , obscure life in the lumber-camps `` HURT TO THE HEART , HIS PRIDE HUMBLED . ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 16]: Were not his efforts acceptable to the Savior , for Whom alone they were made ?
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 29]: Dear me , that detail is LOST SIGHT OF , is not even referred to , the fact that it started out as a motive is entirely forgotten !
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 6]: Then what is the trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 12]: The authoress quite innocently and unconsciously gives the whole business away .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 43]: The trouble was this : this man merely PREACHED to the poor ; that is not the University Settlement 's way ; it deals in larger and better things than that , and it did not enthuse over that crude Salvation-Army eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 9]: It was courteous to Holme -- but cool .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 14]: It did not pet him , did not take him to its bosom .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 19]: `` PERISHED WERE ALL HIS DREAMS OF DISTINCTION , THE PRAISE AND GRATEFUL APPROVAL -- '' Of whom ?
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 3]: The Savior ?
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 8]: No ; the Savior is not mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 5]: Of whom , then ?
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 6]: Of `` His FELLOW-WORKERS . ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 6]: Why did he want that ?
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 17]: Because the Master inside of him wanted it , and would not be content without it .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 78]: That emphasized sentence quoted above , reveals the secret we have been seeking , the original impulse , the REAL impulse , which moved the obscure and unappreciated Adirondack lumberman to sacrifice his family and go on that crusade to the East Side -- which said original impulse was this , to wit : without knowing it HE WENT THERE TO SHOW A NEGLECTED WORLD THE LARGE TALENT THAT WAS IN HIM , AND RISE TO DISTINCTION .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 21]: As I have warned you before , NO act springs from any but the one law , the one motive .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 20]: But I pray you , do not accept this law upon my say-so ; but diligently examine for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 33]: Whenever you read of a self-sacrificing act or hear of one , or of a duty done for DUTY 'S SAKE , take it to pieces and look for the REAL motive .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 5]: It is always there .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 7]: Y.M. I do it every day .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 19]: I can not help it , now that I have gotten started upon the degrading and exasperating quest .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 6]: For it is hatefully interesting !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 9]: -- in fact , fascinating is the word .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 30]: As soon as I come across a golden deed in a book I have to stop and take it apart and examine it , I can not help myself .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 11]: O.M. Have you ever found one that defeated the rule ?
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 9]: Y.M. No -- at least , not yet .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 9]: But take the case of servant-tipping in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 19]: You pay the HOTEL for service ; you owe the servants NOTHING , yet you pay them besides .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 6]: Does n't that defeat it ?
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 4]: In what way ?
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 34]: You are not OBLIGED to do it , therefore its source is compassion for their ill-paid condition , and -- O.M. Has that custom ever vexed you , annoyed you , irritated you ?
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 5]: Y.M. Well , yes .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 7]: O.M. Still you succumbed to it ?
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 4]: Y.M. Of course .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 5]: O.M. Why of course ?
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 25]: Y.M. Well , custom is law , in a way , and laws must be submitted to -- everybody recognizes it as a DUTY .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 12]: Then you pay for the irritating tax for DUTY 'S sake ?
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 8]: Y.M. I suppose it amounts to that .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 20]: Then the impulse which moves you to submit to the tax is not ALL compassion , charity , benevolence ?
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 6]: Y.M. Well -- perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 6]: O.M. Is ANY of it ?
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 13]: Y.M. I -- perhaps I was too hasty in locating its source .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 4]: O.M. Perhaps so .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 17]: In case you ignored the custom would you get prompt and effective service from the servants ?
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 7]: Y.M. Oh , hear yourself talk !
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 4]: Those European servants ?
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 14]: Why , you would n't get any of all , to speak of .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 16]: O.M. Could n't THAT work as an impulse to move you to pay the tax ?
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 7]: Y.M. I am not denying it .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 20]: O.M. Apparently , then , it is a case of for-duty 's - sake with a little self-interest added ?
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 10]: Y.M. Yes , it has the look of it .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 70]: But here is a point : we pay that tax knowing it to be unjust and an extortion ; yet we go away with a pain at the heart if we think we have been stingy with the poor fellows ; and we heartily wish we were back again , so that we could do the right thing , and MORE than the right thing , the GENEROUS thing .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 18]: I think it will be difficult for you to find any thought of self in that impulse .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 9]: O.M. I wonder why you should think so .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 14]: When you find service charged in the HOTEL bill does it annoy you ?
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 11]: O.M. Do you ever complain of the amount of it ?
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 10]: Y.M. No , it would not occur to me .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 11]: The EXPENSE , then , is not the annoying detail .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 19]: It is a fixed charge , and you pay it cheerfully , you pay it without a murmur .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 25]: When you came to pay the servants , how would you like it if each of the men and maids had a fixed charge ?
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 4]: Y.M. Like it ?
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 4]: I should rejoice !
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 25]: O.M. Even if the fixed tax were a shade MORE than you had been in the habit of paying in the form of tips ?
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 5]: Y.M. Indeed , yes !
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 6]: O.M. Very well , then .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 34]: As I understand it , it is n't really compassion nor yet duty that moves you to pay the tax , and it is n't the AMOUNT of the tax that annoys you .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 5]: Yet SOMETHING annoys you .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 23]: Y.M. Well , the trouble is , you never know WHAT to pay , the tax varies so , all over Europe .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 6]: So you have to guess ?
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 6]: There is no other way .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 66]: So you go on thinking and thinking , and calculating and guessing , and consulting with other people and getting their views ; and it spoils your sleep nights , and makes you distraught in the daytime , and while you are pretending to look at the sights you are only guessing and guessing and guessing all the time , and being worried and miserable .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 22]: O.M. And all about a debt which you do n't owe and do n't have to pay unless you want to !
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 2]: Strange .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 8]: What is the purpose of the guessing ?
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 20]: Y.M. To guess out what is right to give them , and not be unfair to any of them .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 44]: It has quite a noble look -- taking so much pains and using up so much valuable time in order to be just and fair to a poor servant to whom you owe nothing , but who needs money and is ill paid .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 23]: Y.M. I think , myself , that if there is any ungracious motive back of it it will be hard to find .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 14]: O.M. How do you know when you have not paid a servant fairly ?
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 12]: Y.M. Why , he is silent ; does not thank you .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 11]: Sometimes he gives you a look that makes you ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 27]: You are too proud to rectify your mistake there , with people looking , but afterward you keep on wishing and wishing you HAD done it .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 10]: My , the shame and the pain of it !
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 22]: Sometimes you see , by the signs , that you have it JUST RIGHT , and you go away mightily satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 22]: Sometimes the man is so effusively thankful that you know you have given him a good deal MORE than was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 3]: O.M. NECESSARY ?
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 4]: Necessary for what ?
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 5]: Y.M. To content him .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 7]: O.M. How do you feel THEN ?
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 3]: Y.M. Repentant .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 28]: It is my belief that you have NOT been concerning yourself in guessing out his just dues , but only in ciphering out what would CONTENT him .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 11]: And I think you have a self-deluding reason for that .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 24]: If you fell short of what he was expecting and wanting , you would get a look which would SHAME YOU BEFORE FOLK .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 6]: That would give you PAIN .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 13]: YOU -- for you are only working for yourself , not HIM .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 37]: If you gave him too much you would be ASHAMED OF YOURSELF for it , and that would give YOU pain -- another case of thinking of YOURSELF , protecting yourself , SAVING YOURSELF FROM DISCOMFORT .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 18]: You never think of the servant once -- except to guess out how to get HIS APPROVAL .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 23]: If you get that , you get your OWN approval , and that is the sole and only thing you are after .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 33]: The Master inside of you is then satisfied , contented , comfortable ; there was NO OTHER thing at stake , as a matter of FIRST interest , anywhere in the transaction .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 23]: Further Instances Y.M. Well , to think of it ; Self-Sacrifice for others , the grandest thing in man , ruled out !
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 2]: non-existent !
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 9]: O.M. Are you accusing me of saying that ?
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 5]: Y.M. Why , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 7]: O.M. I have n't said it .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 7]: What did you say , then ?
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 23]: That no man has ever sacrificed himself in the common meaning of that phrase -- which is , self-sacrifice for another ALONE .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 16]: Men make daily sacrifices for others , but it is for their own sake FIRST .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 9]: The act must content their own spirit FIRST .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 6]: The other beneficiaries come second .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 11]: Y.M. And the same with duty for duty 's sake ?
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 19]: No man performs a duty for mere duty 's sake ; the act must content his spirit FIRST .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 15]: He must feel better for DOING the duty than he would for shirking it .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 7]: Otherwise he will not do it .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 9]: Y.M. Take the case of the BERKELEY CASTLE .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 9]: It was a noble duty , greatly performed .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 12]: Take it to pieces and examine it , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 12]: A British troop-ship crowded with soldiers and their wives and children .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 9]: She struck a rock and began to sink .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 13]: There was room in the boats for the women and children only .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 26]: The colonel lined up his regiment on the deck and said `` it is our duty to die , that they may be saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 8]: There was no murmur , no protest .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 9]: The boats carried away the women and children .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 51]: When the death-moment was come , the colonel and his officers took their several posts , the men stood at shoulder-arms , and so , as on dress-parade , with their flag flying and the drums beating , they went down , a sacrifice to duty for duty 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 9]: Can you view it as other than that ?
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 13]: It was something as fine as that , as exalted as that .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 18]: Could you have remained in those ranks and gone down to your death in that unflinching way ?
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 4]: Y.M. Could I ?
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 6]: No , I could not .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 3]: O.M. Think .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 15]: Imagine yourself there , with that watery doom creeping higher and higher around you .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 6]: Y.M. I can imagine it .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 8]: I feel all the horror of it .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 16]: I could not have endured it , I could not have remained in my place .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 4]: I know it .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 3]: O.M. Why ?
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 20]: There is no why about it : I know myself , and I know I could n't DO it .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 10]: But it would be your DUTY to do it .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 11]: Y.M. Yes , I know -- but I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 14]: It was more than thousand men , yet not one of them flinched .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 27]: Some of them must have been born with your temperament ; if they could do that great duty for duty 's SAKE , why not you ?
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 48]: Do n't you know that you could go out and gather together a thousand clerks and mechanics and put them on that deck and ask them to die for duty 's sake , and not two dozen of them would stay in the ranks to the end ?
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 7]: Y.M. Yes , I know that .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 38]: But you TRAIN them , and put them through a campaign or two ; then they would be soldiers ; soldiers , with a soldier 's pride , a soldier 's self-respect , a soldier 's ideals .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 21]: They would have to content a SOLDIER 'S spirit then , not a clerk 's , not a mechanic 's .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 16]: They could not content that spirit by shirking a soldier 's duty , could they ?
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 5]: Y.M. I suppose not .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 21]: Then they would do the duty not for the DUTY 'S sake , but for their OWN sake -- primarily .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 31]: The DUTY was JUST THE SAME , and just as imperative , when they were clerks , mechanics , raw recruits , but they would n't perform it for that .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 19]: As clerks and mechanics they had other ideals , another spirit to satisfy , and they satisfied it .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 9]: They HAD to ; it is the law .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 4]: TRAINING is potent .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 21]: Training toward higher and higher , and ever higher ideals is worth any man 's thought and labor and diligence .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 21]: Y.M. Consider the man who stands by his duty and goes to the stake rather than be recreant to it .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 8]: It is his make and his training .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 18]: He has to content the spirit that is in him , though it cost him his life .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 51]: Another man , just as sincerely religious , but of different temperament , will fail of that duty , though recognizing it as a duty , and grieving to be unequal to it : but he must content the spirit that is in him -- he can not help it .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 31]: He could not perform that duty for duty 's SAKE , for that would not content his spirit , and the contenting of his spirit must be looked to FIRST .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 8]: It takes precedence of all other duties .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 37]: Y.M. Take the case of a clergyman of stainless private morals who votes for a thief for public office , on his own party 's ticket , and against an honest man on the other ticket .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 7]: He has to content his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 21]: He has no public morals ; he has no private ones , where his party 's prosperity is at stake .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 11]: He will always be true to his make and training .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 5]: IV Training Young Man .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 8]: You keep using that word -- training .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 10]: By it do you particularly mean -- Old Man .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 8]: Study , instruction , lectures , sermons ?
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 13]: That is a part of it -- but not a large part .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 7]: I mean ALL the outside influences .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 7]: There are a million of them .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 20]: From the cradle to the grave , during all his waking hours , the human being is under training .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 11]: In the very first rank of his trainers stands ASSOCIATION .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 30]: It is his human environment which influences his mind and his feelings , furnishes him his ideals , and sets him on his road and keeps him in it .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 27]: If he leave that road he will find himself shunned by the people whom he most loves and esteems , and whose approval he most values .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 21]: He is a chameleon ; by the law of his nature he takes the color of his place of resort .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 23]: The influences about him create his preferences , his aversions , his politics , his tastes , his morals , his religion .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 9]: He creates none of these things for himself .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 17]: He THINKS he does , but that is because he has not examined into the matter .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 5]: You have seen Presbyterians ?
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 3]: Y.M. Many .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 12]: O.M. How did they happen to be Presbyterians and not Congregationalists ?
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 102]: And why were the Congregationalists not Baptists , and the Baptists Roman Catholics , and the Roman Catholics Buddhists , and the Buddhists Quakers , and the Quakers Episcopalians , and the Episcopalians Millerites and the Millerites Hindus , and the Hindus Atheists , and the Atheists Spiritualists , and the Spiritualists Agnostics , and the Agnostics Methodists , and the Methodists Confucians , and the Confucians Unitarians , and the Unitarians Mohammedans , and the Mohammedans Salvation Warriors , and the Salvation Warriors Zoroastrians , and the Zoroastrians Christian Scientists , and the Christian Scientists Mormons -- and so on ?
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 7]: You may answer your question yourself .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 29]: That list of sects is not a record of STUDIES , searchings , seekings after light ; it mainly -LRB- and sarcastically -RRB- indicates what ASSOCIATION can do .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 57]: If you know a man 's nationality you can come within a split hair of guessing the complexion of his religion : English -- Protestant ; American -- ditto ; Spaniard , Frenchman , Irishman , Italian , South American -- Roman Catholic ; Russian -- Greek Catholic ; Turk -- Mohammedan ; and so on .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 45]: And when you know the man 's religious complexion , you know what sort of religious books he reads when he wants some more light , and what sort of books he avoids , lest by accident he get more light than he wants .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 77]: In America if you know which party-collar a voter wears , you know what his associations are , and how he came by his politics , and which breed of newspaper he reads to get light , and which breed he diligently avoids , and which breed of mass-meetings he attends in order to broaden his political knowledge , and which breed of mass-meetings he does n't attend , except to refute its doctrines with brickbats .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 13]: We are always hearing of people who are around SEEKING AFTER TRUTH .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 10]: I have never seen a -LRB- permanent -RRB- specimen .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 7]: I think he had never lived .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 19]: But I have seen several entirely sincere people who THOUGHT they were -LRB- permanent -RRB- Seekers after Truth .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 34]: They sought diligently , persistently , carefully , cautiously , profoundly , with perfect honesty and nicely adjusted judgment -- until they believed that without doubt or question they had found the Truth .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 8]: THAT WAS THE END OF THE SEARCH .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 20]: The man spent the rest of his life hunting up shingles wherewith to protect his Truth from the weather .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 52]: If he was seeking after political Truth he found it in one or another of the hundred political gospels which govern men in the earth ; if he was seeking after the Only True Religion he found it in one or another of the three thousand that are on the market .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 41]: In any case , when he found the Truth HE SOUGHT NO FURTHER ; but from that day forth , with his soldering-iron in one hand and his bludgeon in the other he tinkered its leaks and reasoned with objectors .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 18]: There have been innumerable Temporary Seekers of Truth -- have you ever heard of a permanent one ?
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 12]: In the very nature of man such a person is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 31]: However , to drop back to the text -- training : all training is one from or another of OUTSIDE INFLUENCE , and ASSOCIATION is the largest part of it .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 14]: A man is never anything but what his outside influences have made him .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 25]: They train him downward or they train him upward -- but they TRAIN him ; they are at work upon him all the time .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 30]: Then if he happen by the accidents of life to be evilly placed there is no help for him , according to your notions -- he must train downward .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 6]: O.M. No help for him ?
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 6]: No help for this chameleon ?
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 5]: It is a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 12]: It is in his chameleonship that his greatest good fortune lies .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 11]: He has only to change his habitat -- his ASSOCIATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 25]: But the impulse to do it must come from the OUTSIDE -- he can not originate it himself , with that purpose in view .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 26]: Sometimes a very small and accidental thing can furnish him the initiatory impulse and start him on a new road , with a new idea .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 43]: The chance remark of a sweetheart , `` I hear that you are a coward , '' may water a seed that shall sprout and bloom and flourish , and ended in producing a surprising fruitage -- in the fields of war .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 10]: The history of man is full of such accidents .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 22]: The accident of a broken leg brought a profane and ribald soldier under religious influences and furnished him a new ideal .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 35]: From that accident sprang the Order of the Jesuits , and it has been shaking thrones , changing policies , and doing other tremendous work for two hundred years -- and will go on .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 60]: The chance reading of a book or of a paragraph in a newspaper can start a man on a new track and make him renounce his old associations and seek new ones that are IN SYMPATHY WITH HIS NEW IDEAL : and the result , for that man , can be an entire change of his way of life .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 10]: Y.M. Are you hinting at a scheme of procedure ?
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 10]: O.M. Not a new one -- an old one .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 4]: Old as mankind .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 9]: O.M. Merely the laying of traps for people .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 9]: Traps baited with INITIATORY IMPULSES TOWARD HIGH IDEALS .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 7]: It is what the tract-distributor does .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 7]: It is what the missionary does .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 8]: It is what governments ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 5]: Y.M. Do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 12]: In one way they do , in another they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 27]: They separate the smallpox patients from the healthy people , but in dealing with crime they put the healthy into the pest-house along with the sick .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 15]: That is to say , they put the beginners in with the confirmed criminals .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 33]: This would be well if man were naturally inclined to good , but he is n't , and so ASSOCIATION makes the beginners worse than they were when they went into captivity .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 14]: It is putting a very severe punishment upon the comparatively innocent at times .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 25]: They hang a man -- which is a trifling punishment ; this breaks the hearts of his family -- which is a heavy one .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 18]: They comfortably jail and feed a wife-beater , and leave his innocent wife and family to starve .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 20]: Y.M. Do you believe in the doctrine that man is equipped with an intuitive perception of good and evil ?
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 6]: O.M. Adam had n't it .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 7]: But has man acquired it since ?
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 3]: O.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 10]: I think he has no intuitions of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 14]: He gets ALL his ideas , all his impressions , from the outside .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 35]: I keep repeating this , in the hope that I may impress it upon you that you will be interested to observe and examine for yourself and see whether it is true or false .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 10]: Y.M. Where did you get your own aggravating notions ?
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 5]: O.M. From the OUTSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 6]: I did not invent them .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 9]: They are gathered from a thousand unknown sources .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 4]: Mainly UNCONSCIOUSLY gathered .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 14]: Y.M. Do n't you believe that God could make an inherently honest man ?
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 8]: O.M. Yes , I know He could .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 10]: I also know that He never did make one .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 22]: A wiser observer than you has recorded the fact that `` an honest man 's the noblest work of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 12]: He did n't record a fact , he recorded a falsity .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 14]: It is windy , and sounds well , but it is not true .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 15]: God makes a man with honest and dishonest POSSIBILITIES in him and stops there .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 15]: The man 's ASSOCIATIONS develop the possibilities -- the one set or the other .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 12]: The result is accordingly an honest man or a dishonest one .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 13]: Y.M. And the honest one is not entitled to -- O.M. Praise ?
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 8]: How often must I tell you that ?
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 9]: HE is not the architect of his honesty .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 20]: Now then , I will ask you where there is any sense in training people to lead virtuous lives .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 6]: What is gained by it ?
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 20]: The man himself gets large advantages out of it , and that is the main thing -- to HIM .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 28]: He is not a peril to his neighbors , he is not a damage to them -- and so THEY get an advantage out of his virtues .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 8]: That is the main thing to THEM .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 31]: It can make this life comparatively comfortable to the parties concerned ; the NEGLECT of this training can make this life a constant peril and distress to the parties concerned .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 23]: You have said that training is everything ; that training is the man HIMSELF , for it makes him what he is .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 8]: O.M. I said training and ANOTHER thing .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 10]: Let that other thing pass , for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 7]: What were you going to say ?
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 6]: We have an old servant .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 8]: She has been with us twenty-two years .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 15]: Her service used to be faultless , but now she has become very forgetful .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 50]: We are all fond of her ; we all recognize that she can not help the infirmity which age has brought her ; the rest of the family do not scold her for her remissnesses , but at times I do -- I ca n't seem to control myself .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 5]: Do n't I try ?
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 4]: I do try .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 22]: Now , then , when I was ready to dress , this morning , no clean clothes had been put out .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 16]: I lost my temper ; I lose it easiest and quickest in the early morning .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 22]: I rang ; and immediately began to warn myself not to show temper , and to be careful and speak gently .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 6]: I safe-guarded myself most carefully .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 21]: I even chose the very word I would use : `` You 've forgotten the clean clothes , Jane . ''
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 54]: When she appeared in the door I opened my mouth to say that phrase -- and out of it , moved by an instant surge of passion which I was not expecting and had n't time to put under control , came the hot rebuke , `` You 've forgotten them again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 16]: You say a man always does the thing which will best please his Interior Master .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 18]: Whence came the impulse to make careful preparation to save the girl the humiliation of a rebuke ?
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 15]: Did that come from the Master , who is always primarily concerned about HIMSELF ?
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 3]: O.M. Unquestionably .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 9]: There is no other source for any impulse .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 23]: SECONDARILY you made preparation to save the girl , but PRIMARILY its object was to save yourself , by contenting the Master .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 6]: Y.M. How do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 22]: O.M. Has any member of the family ever implored you to watch your temper and not fly out at the girl ?
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 3]: My mother .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 4]: You love her ?
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 7]: Y.M. Oh , more than that !
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 12]: You would always do anything in your power to please her ?
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 13]: It is a delight to me to do anything to please her !
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 3]: O.M. Why ?
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 12]: YOU WOULD DO IT FOR PAY , SOLELY -- for PROFIT .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 12]: What profit would you expect and certainly receive from the investment ?
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 3]: Y.M. Personally ?
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 2]: None .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 6]: To please HER is enough .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 26]: It appears , then , that your object , primarily , WAS N'T to save the girl a humiliation , but to PLEASE YOUR MOTHER .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 14]: It also appears that to please your mother gives YOU a strong pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 13]: Is not that the profit which you get out of the investment ?
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 10]: Is n't that the REAL profits and FIRST profit ?
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 5]: Y.M. Oh , well ?
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 3]: Go on .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 17]: In ALL transactions , the Interior Master looks to it that YOU GET THE FIRST PROFIT .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 6]: Otherwise there is no transaction .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 31]: Y.M. Well , then , if I was so anxious to get that profit and so intent upon it , why did I threw it away by losing my temper ?
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 13]: In order to get ANOTHER profit which suddenly superseded it in value .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 5]: Y.M. Where was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 13]: O.M. Ambushed behind your born temperament , and waiting for a chance .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 28]: Your native warm temper suddenly jumped to the front , and FOR THE MOMENT its influence was more powerful than your mother 's , and abolished it .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 16]: In that instance you were eager to flash out a hot rebuke and enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 9]: You did enjoy it , did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 10]: Y.M. For -- for a quarter of a second .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 5]: Yes -- I did .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 42]: O.M. Very well , it is as I have said : the thing which will give you the MOST pleasure , the most satisfaction , in any moment or FRACTION of a moment , is the thing you will always do .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 14]: You must content the Master 's LATEST whim , whatever it may be .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 24]: But when the tears came into the old servant 's eyes I could have cut my hand off for what I had done .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 3]: O.M. Right .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 14]: You had humiliated YOURSELF , you see , you had given yourself PAIN .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 23]: Nothing is of FIRST importance to a man except results which damage HIM or profit him -- all the rest is SECONDARY .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 13]: Your Master was displeased with you , although you had obeyed him .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 23]: He required a prompt REPENTANCE ; you obeyed again ; you HAD to -- there is never any escape from his commands .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 34]: He is a hard master and fickle ; he changes his mind in the fraction of a second , but you must be ready to obey , and you will obey , ALWAYS .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 15]: If he requires repentance , you content him , you will always furnish it .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 21]: He must be nursed , petted , coddled , and kept contented , let the terms be what they may .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 3]: Y.M. Training !
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 9]: Oh , what 's the use of it ?
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 26]: Did n't I , and did n't my mother try to train me up to where I would no longer fly out at that girl ?
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 11]: O.M. Have you never managed to keep back a scolding ?
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 8]: Y.M. Oh , certainly -- many times .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 7]: More times this year than last ?
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 8]: Y.M. Yes , a good many more .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 9]: More times last year than the year before ?
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 13]: There is a large improvement , then , in the two years ?
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 5]: Y.M. Yes , undoubtedly .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 6]: Then your question is answered .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 8]: You see there IS use in training .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 3]: Keep on .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 4]: Keeping faithfully on .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 5]: You are doing well .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 7]: Y.M. Will my reform reach perfection ?
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 3]: It will .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 5]: UP to YOUR limit .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 4]: Y.M. My limit ?
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 7]: What do you mean by that ?
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 12]: You remember that you said that I said training was EVERYTHING .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 13]: I corrected you , and said `` training and ANOTHER thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 16]: That other thing is TEMPERAMENT -- that is , the disposition you were born with .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 27]: YOU CA N'T ERADICATE YOUR DISPOSITION NOR ANY RAG OF IT -- you can only put a pressure on it and keep it down and quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 6]: You have a warm temper ?
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 22]: You will never get rid of it ; but by watching it you can keep it down nearly all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 6]: ITS PRESENCE IS YOUR LIMIT .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 24]: Your reform will never quite reach perfection , for your temper will beat you now and then , but you come near enough .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 10]: You have made valuable progress and can make more .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 6]: There IS use in training .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 3]: Immense use .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 26]: Presently you will reach a new stage of development , then your progress will be easier ; will proceed on a simpler basis , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 3]: Y.M. Explain .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 48]: You keep back your scoldings now , to please YOURSELF by pleasing your MOTHER ; presently the mere triumphing over your temper will delight your vanity and confer a more delicious pleasure and satisfaction upon you than even the approbation of your MOTHER confers upon you now .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 21]: You will then labor for yourself directly and at FIRST HAND , not by the roundabout way through your mother .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 12]: It simplifies the matter , and it also strengthens the impulse .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 5]: Y.M. Ah , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 23]: But I sha 'n' t ever reach the point where I will spare the girl for HER sake PRIMARILY , not mine ?
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 5]: O.M. Why -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 3]: In heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 9]: Y.M. -LRB- AFTER A REFLECTIVE PAUSE -RRB- Temperament .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 10]: Well , I see one must allow for temperament .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 9]: It is a large factor , sure enough .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 9]: My mother is thoughtful , and not hot-tempered .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 24]: When I was dressed I went to her room ; she was not there ; I called , she answered from the bathroom .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 6]: I heard the water running .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 20]: She answered , without temper , that Jane had forgotten her bath , and she was preparing it herself .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 55]: I offered to ring , but she said , `` No , do n't do that ; it would only distress her to be confronted with her lapse , and would be a rebuke ; she does n't deserve that -- she is not to blame for the tricks her memory serves her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 10]: I say -- has my mother an Interior Master ?
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 6]: -- and where was he ?
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 4]: He was there .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 14]: There , and looking out for his own peace and pleasure and contentment .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 10]: The girl 's distress would have pained YOUR MOTHER .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 13]: Otherwise the girl would have been rung up , distress and all .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 45]: I know women who would have gotten a No. 1 PLEASURE out of ringing Jane up -- and so they would infallibly have pushed the button and obeyed the law of their make and training , which are the servants of their Interior Masters .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 16]: It is quite likely that a part of your mother 's forbearance came from training .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 36]: The GOOD kind of training -- whose best and highest function is to see to it that every time it confers a satisfaction upon its pupil a benefit shall fall at second hand upon others .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 27]: If you were going to condense into an admonition your plan for the general betterment of the race 's condition , how would you word it ?
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 41]: Admonition O.M. Diligently train your ideals UPWARD and STILL UPWARD toward a summit where you will find your chiefest pleasure in conduct which , while contenting you , will be sure to confer benefits upon your neighbor and the community .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 7]: Y.M. Is that a new gospel ?
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 3]: O.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 6]: It has been taught before ?
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 6]: O.M. For ten thousand years .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 4]: Y.M. By whom ?
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 11]: O.M. All the great religions -- all the great gospels .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 8]: Then there is nothing new about it ?
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 7]: O.M. Oh yes , there is .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 8]: It is candidly stated , this time .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 7]: That has not been done before .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 6]: Y.M. How do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 16]: O.M. Have n't I put YOU FIRST , and your neighbor and the community AFTERWARD ?
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 14]: Y.M. Well , yes , that is a difference , it is true .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 15]: The difference between straight speaking and crooked ; the difference between frankness and shuffling .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 3]: Y.M. Explain .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 76]: The others offer your a hundred bribes to be good , thus conceding that the Master inside of you must be conciliated and contented first , and that you will do nothing at FIRST HAND but for his sake ; then they turn square around and require you to do good for OTHER 'S sake CHIEFLY ; and to do your duty for duty 's SAKE , chiefly ; and to do acts of SELF-SACRIFICE .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 111]: Thus at the outset we all stand upon the same ground -- recognition of the supreme and absolute Monarch that resides in man , and we all grovel before him and appeal to him ; then those others dodge and shuffle , and face around and unfrankly and inconsistently and illogically change the form of their appeal and direct its persuasions to man 's SECOND-PLACE powers and to powers which have NO EXISTENCE in him , thus advancing them to FIRST place ; whereas in my Admonition I stick logically and consistently to the original position : I place the Interior Master 's requirements FIRST , and keep them there .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 36]: If we grant , for the sake of argument , that your scheme and the other schemes aim at and produce the same result -- RIGHT LIVING -- has yours an advantage over the others ?
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 9]: O.M. One , yes -- a large one .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 8]: It has no concealments , no deceptions .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 34]: When a man leads a right and valuable life under it he is not deceived as to the REAL chief motive which impels him to it -- in those other cases he is .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 6]: Y.M. Is that an advantage ?
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 14]: Is it an advantage to live a lofty life for a mean reason ?
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 21]: In the other cases he lives the lofty life under the IMPRESSION that he is living for a lofty reason .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 6]: Is not that an advantage ?
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 4]: O.M. Perhaps so .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 51]: The same advantage he might get out of thinking himself a duke , and living a duke 's life and parading in ducal fuss and feathers , when he was n't a duke at all , and could find it out if he would only examine the herald 's records .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 40]: But anyway , he is obliged to do a duke 's part ; he puts his hand in his pocket and does his benevolences on as big a scale as he can stand , and that benefits the community .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 9]: He could do that without being a duke .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 4]: But would he ?
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 10]: O.M. Do n't you see where you are arriving ?
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 3]: Y.M. Where ?
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 64]: At the standpoint of the other schemes : That it is good morals to let an ignorant duke do showy benevolences for his pride 's sake , a pretty low motive , and go on doing them unwarned , lest if he were made acquainted with the actual motive which prompted them he might shut up his purse and cease to be good ?
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 25]: But is n't it best to leave him in ignorance , as long as he THINKS he is doing good for others ' sake ?
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 4]: O.M. Perhaps so .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 9]: It is the position of the other schemes .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 19]: They think humbug is good enough morals when the dividend on it is good deeds and handsome conduct .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 39]: It is my opinion that under your scheme of a man 's doing a good deed for his OWN sake first-off , instead of first for the GOOD DEED 'S sake , no man would ever do one .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 8]: O.M. Have you committed a benevolence lately ?
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 3]: This morning .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 5]: O.M. Give the particulars .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 51]: The cabin of the old negro woman who used to nurse me when I was a child and who saved my life once at the risk of her own , was burned last night , and she came mourning this morning , and pleading for money to build another one .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 4]: You furnished it ?
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 3]: Y.M. Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 8]: You were glad you had the money ?
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 3]: Y.M. Money ?
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 4]: I had n't .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 5]: I sold my horse .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 8]: You were glad you had the horse ?
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 34]: Y.M. Of course I was ; for if I had n't had the horse I should have been incapable , and my MOTHER would have captured the chance to set old Sally up .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 12]: You were cordially glad you were not caught out and incapable ?
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 7]: Y.M. Oh , I just was !
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 11]: O.M. Now , then -- Y.M. Stop where you are !
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 91]: I know your whole catalog of questions , and I could answer every one of them without your wasting the time to ask them ; but I will summarize the whole thing in a single remark : I did the charity knowing it was because the act would give ME a splendid pleasure , and because old Sally 's moving gratitude and delight would give ME another one ; and because the reflection that she would be happy now and out of her trouble would fill ME full of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 26]: I did the whole thing with my eyes open and recognizing and realizing that I was looking out for MY share of the profits FIRST .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 7]: Now then , I have confessed .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 3]: Go on .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 15]: O.M. I have n't anything to offer ; you have covered the whole ground .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 45]: Can you have been any MORE strongly moved to help Sally out of her trouble -- could you have done the deed any more eagerly -- if you had been under the delusion that you were doing it for HER sake and profit only ?
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 3]: Y.M. No !
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 22]: Nothing in the world could have made the impulse which moved me more powerful , more masterful , more thoroughly irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 5]: I played the limit !
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 4]: O.M. Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 101]: You begin to suspect -- and I claim to KNOW -- that when a man is a shade MORE STRONGLY MOVED to do ONE of two things or of two dozen things than he is to do any one of the OTHERS , he will infallibly do that ONE thing , be it good or be it evil ; and if it be good , not all the beguilements of all the casuistries can increase the strength of the impulse by a single shade or add a shade to the comfort and contentment he will get out of the act .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 46]: Then you believe that such tendency toward doing good as is in men 's hearts would not be diminished by the removal of the delusion that good deeds are done primarily for the sake of No. 2 instead of for the sake of No. 1 ?
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 7]: That is what I fully believe .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 15]: Y.M. Does n't it somehow seem to take from the dignity of the deed ?
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 10]: If there is dignity in falsity , it does .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 4]: It removes that .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 9]: What is left for the moralists to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 43]: O.M. Teach unreservedly what he already teaches with one side of his mouth and takes back with the other : Do right FOR YOUR OWN SAKE , and be happy in knowing that your NEIGHBOR will certainly share in the benefits resulting .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 5]: Y.M. Repeat your Admonition .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 40]: O.M. DILIGENTLY TRAIN YOUR IDEALS UPWARD AND STILL UPWARD TOWARD A SUMMIT WHERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR CHIEFEST PLEASURE IN CONDUCT WHICH , WHILE CONTENTING YOU , WILL BE SURE TO CONFER BENEFITS UPON YOUR NEIGHBOR AND THE COMMUNITY .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 13]: Y.M. One 's EVERY act proceeds from EXTERIOR INFLUENCES , you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 25]: If I conclude to rob a person , I am not the ORIGINATOR of the idea , but it comes in from the OUTSIDE ?
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 17]: I see him handling money -- for instance -- and THAT moves me to the crime ?
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 6]: O.M. That , by itself ?
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 5]: Oh , certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 21]: It is merely the LATEST outside influence of a procession of preparatory influences stretching back over a period of years .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 19]: No SINGLE outside influence can make a man do a thing which is at war with his training .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 32]: The most it can do is to start his mind on a new tract and open it to the reception of NEW influences -- as in the case of Ignatius Loyola .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 30]: In time these influences can train him to a point where it will be consonant with his new character to yield to the FINAL influence and do that thing .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 20]: I will put the case in a form which will make my theory clear to you , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 8]: Here are two ingots of virgin gold .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 23]: They shall represent a couple of characters which have been refined and perfected in the virtues by years of diligent right training .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 23]: Suppose you wanted to break down these strong and well-compacted characters -- what influence would you bring to bear upon the ingots ?
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 6]: Y.M. Work it out yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 2]: Proceed .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 17]: O.M. Suppose I turn upon one of them a steam-jet during a long succession of hours .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 6]: Will there be a result ?
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 7]: Y.M. None that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 3]: O.M. Why ?
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 10]: A steam-jet can not break down such a substance .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 4]: O.M. Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 20]: The steam is an OUTSIDE INFLUENCE , but it is ineffective because the gold TAKES NO INTEREST IN IT .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 7]: The ingot remains as it was .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 28]: Suppose we add to the steam some quicksilver in a vaporized condition , and turn the jet upon the ingot , will there be an instantaneous result ?
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 25]: The QUICKSILVER is an outside influence which gold -LRB- by its peculiar nature -- say TEMPERAMENT , DISPOSITION -RRB- CAN NOT BE INDIFFERENT TO .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 27]: It stirs up the interest of the gold , although we do not perceive it ; but a SINGLE application of the influence works no damage .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 17]: Let us continue the application in a steady stream , and call each minute a year .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 32]: By the end of ten or twenty minutes -- ten or twenty years -- the little ingot is sodden with quicksilver , its virtues are gone , its character is degraded .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 25]: At last it is ready to yield to a temptation which it would have taken no notice of , ten or twenty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 15]: We will apply that temptation in the form of a pressure of my finger .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 5]: You note the result ?
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 10]: Y.M. Yes ; the ingot has crumbled to sand .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 5]: I understand , now .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 26]: It is not the SINGLE outside influence that does the work , but only the LAST one of a long and disintegrating accumulation of them .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 33]: I see , now , how my SINGLE impulse to rob the man is not the one that makes me do it , but only the LAST one of a preparatory series .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 7]: You might illustrate with a parable .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 6]: A Parable O.M. I will .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 12]: There was once a pair of New England boys -- twins .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 14]: They were alike in good dispositions , feckless morals , and personal appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 8]: They were the models of the Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 21]: At fifteen George had the opportunity to go as cabin-boy in a whale-ship , and sailed away for the Pacific .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 8]: Henry remained at home in the village .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 20]: At eighteen George was a sailor before the mast , and Henry was teacher of the advanced Bible class .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 44]: At twenty-two George , through fighting-habits and drinking-habits acquired at sea and in the sailor boarding-houses of the European and Oriental ports , was a common rough in Hong-Kong , and out of a job ; and Henry was superintendent of the Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 19]: At twenty-six George was a wanderer , a tramp , and Henry was pastor of the village church .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 11]: Then George came home , and was Henry 's guest .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 60]: One evening a man passed by and turned down the lane , and Henry said , with a pathetic smile , `` Without intending me a discomfort , that man is always keeping me reminded of my pinching poverty , for he carries heaps of money about him , and goes by here every evening of his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 55]: That OUTSIDE INFLUENCE -- that remark -- was enough for George , but IT was not the one that made him ambush the man and rob him , it merely represented the eleven years ' accumulation of such influences , and gave birth to the act for which their long gestation had made preparation .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 33]: It had never entered the head of Henry to rob the man -- his ingot had been subjected to clean steam only ; but George 's had been subjected to vaporized quicksilver .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 7]: V More About the Machine Note .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 33]: -- When Mrs. W. asks how can a millionaire give a single dollar to colleges and museums while one human being is destitute of bread , she has answered her question herself .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 48]: Her feeling for the poor shows that she has a standard of benevolence ; there she has conceded the millionaire 's privilege of having a standard ; since she evidently requires him to adopt her standard , she is by that act requiring herself to adopt his .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 28]: The human being always looks down when he is examining another person 's standard ; he never find one that he has to examine by looking up .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 6]: The Man-Machine Again Young Man .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 9]: You really think man is a mere machine ?
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 3]: Old Man .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 22]: Y.M. And that his mind works automatically and is independent of his control -- carries on thought on its own hook ?
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 15]: It is diligently at work , unceasingly at work , during every waking moment .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 25]: Have you never tossed about all night , imploring , beseeching , commanding your mind to stop work and let you go to sleep ?
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 34]: -- you who perhaps imagine that your mind is your servant and must obey your orders , think what you tell it to think , and stop when you tell it to stop .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 18]: When it chooses to work , there is no way to keep it still for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 20]: The brightest man would not be able to supply it with subjects if he had to hunt them up .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 23]: If it needed the man 's help it would wait for him to give it work when he wakes in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 5]: Y.M. Maybe it does .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 21]: O.M. No , it begins right away , before the man gets wide enough awake to give it a suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 28]: He may go to sleep saying , `` The moment I wake I will think upon such and such a subject , '' but he will fail .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 36]: His mind will be too quick for him ; by the time he has become nearly enough awake to be half conscious , he will find that it is already at work upon another subject .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 6]: Make the experiment and see .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 17]: At any rate , he can make it stick to a subject if he wants to .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 11]: O.M. Not if it find another that suits it better .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 16]: As a rule it will listen to neither a dull speaker nor a bright one .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 5]: It refuses all persuasion .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 37]: The dull speaker wearies it and sends it far away in idle dreams ; the bright speaker throws out stimulating ideas which it goes chasing after and is at once unconscious of him and his talk .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 21]: You can not keep your mind from wandering , if it wants to ; it is master , not you .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 17]: After an Interval of Days O.M. Now , dreams -- but we will examine that later .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 25]: Meantime , did you try commanding your mind to wait for orders from you , and not do any thinking on its own hook ?
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 20]: Y.M. Yes , I commanded it to stand ready to take orders when I should wake in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 5]: O.M. Did it obey ?
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 16]: It went to thinking of something of its own initiation , without waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 33]: Also -- as you suggested -- at night I appointed a theme for it to begin on in the morning , and commanded it to begin on that one and no other .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 5]: O.M. Did it obey ?
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 10]: O.M. How many times did you try the experiment ?
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 3]: Y.M. Ten .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 8]: O.M. How many successes did you score ?
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 4]: Y.M. Not one .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 15]: It is as I have said : the mind is independent of the man .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 13]: He has no control over it ; it does as it pleases .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 31]: It will take up a subject in spite of him ; it will stick to it in spite of him ; it will throw it aside in spite of him .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 7]: It is entirely independent of him .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 4]: Y.M. Go on .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 2]: Illustrate .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 6]: O.M. Do you know chess ?
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 8]: Y.M. I learned it a week ago .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 15]: O.M. Did your mind go on playing the game all night that first night ?
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 6]: Y.M. Do n't mention it !
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 27]: It was eagerly , unsatisfiably interested ; it rioted in the combinations ; you implored it to drop the game and let you get some sleep ?
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 10]: It would n't listen ; it played right along .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 15]: It wore me out and I got up haggard and wretched in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 14]: At some time or other you have been captivated by a ridiculous rhyme-jingle ?
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 5]: Y.M. Indeed , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 31]: `` I saw Esau kissing Kate , And she saw I saw Esau ; I saw Esau , he saw Kate , And she saw -- '' And so on .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 9]: My mind went mad with joy over it .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 34]: It repeated it all day and all night for a week in spite of all I could do to stop it , and it seemed to me that I must surely go crazy .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 7]: O.M. And the new popular song ?
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 4]: Y.M. Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 11]: `` In the Swee-eet By and By '' ; etc. .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 29]: Yes , the new popular song with the taking melody sings through one 's head day and night , asleep and awake , till one is a wreck .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 11]: There is no getting the mind to let it alone .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 9]: O.M. Yes , asleep as well as awake .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 6]: The mind is quite independent .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 4]: It is master .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 8]: You have nothing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 33]: It is so apart from you that it can conduct its affairs , sing its songs , play its chess , weave its complex and ingeniously constructed dreams , while you sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 26]: It has no use for your help , no use for your guidance , and never uses either , whether you be asleep or awake .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 23]: You have imagined that you could originate a thought in your mind , and you have sincerely believed you could do it .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 9]: Y.M. Yes , I have had that idea .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 18]: Yet you ca n't originate a dream-thought for it to work out , and get it accepted ?
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 17]: O.M. And you ca n't dictate its procedure after it has originated a dream-thought for itself ?
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 6]: No one can do it .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 15]: Do you think the waking mind and the dream mind are the same machine ?
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 6]: There is argument for it .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 7]: We have wild and fantastic day-thoughts ?
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 5]: Things that are dream-like ?
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 27]: Y.M. Yes -- like Mr. Wells 's man who invented a drug that made him invisible ; and like the Arabian tales of the Thousand Nights .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 16]: O.M. And there are dreams that are rational , simple , consistent , and unfantastic ?
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 8]: I have dreams that are like that .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 73]: Dreams that are just like real life ; dreams in which there are several persons with distinctly differentiated characters -- inventions of my mind and yet strangers to me : a vulgar person ; a refined one ; a wise person ; a fool ; a cruel person ; a kind and compassionate one ; a quarrelsome person ; a peacemaker ; old persons and young ; beautiful girls and homely ones .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 11]: They talk in character , each preserves his own characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 50]: There are vivid fights , vivid and biting insults , vivid love-passages ; there are tragedies and comedies , there are griefs that go to one 's heart , there are sayings and doings that make you laugh : indeed , the whole thing is exactly like real life .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 30]: O.M. Your dreaming mind originates the scheme , consistently and artistically develops it , and carries the little drama creditably through -- all without help or suggestion from you ?
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 23]: It is argument that it could do the like awake without help or suggestion from you -- and I think it does .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 20]: It is argument that it is the same old mind in both cases , and never needs your help .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 18]: I think the mind is purely a machine , a thoroughly independent machine , an automatic machine .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 12]: Have you tried the other experiment which I suggested to you ?
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 4]: Y.M. Which one ?
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 18]: The one which was to determine how much influence you have over your mind -- if any .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 13]: Y.M. Yes , and got more or less entertainment out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 38]: I did as you ordered : I placed two texts before my eyes -- one a dull one and barren of interest , the other one full of interest , inflamed with it , white-hot with it .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 13]: I commanded my mind to busy itself solely with the dull one .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 5]: O.M. Did it obey ?
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 9]: Y.M. Well , no , it did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 8]: It busied itself with the other one .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 10]: O.M. Did you try hard to make it obey ?
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 9]: Y.M. Yes , I did my honest best .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 15]: What was the text which it refused to be interested in or think about ?
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 88]: It was this question : If A owes B a dollar and a half , and B owes C two and three-quarter , and C owes A thirty-five cents , and D and A together owe E and B three-sixteenths of -- of -- I do n't remember the rest , now , but anyway it was wholly uninteresting , and I could not force my mind to stick to it even half a minute at a time ; it kept flying off to the other text .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 6]: What was the other text ?
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 7]: It is no matter about that .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 5]: But what was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 3]: A photograph .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 4]: O.M. Your own ?
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 4]: It was hers .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 8]: You really made an honest good test .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 7]: Did you make a second trial ?
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 35]: I commanded my mind to interest itself in the morning paper 's report of the pork-market , and at the same time I reminded it of an experience of mine of sixteen years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 17]: It refused to consider the pork and gave its whole blazing interest to that ancient incident .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 5]: What was the incident ?
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 13]: An armed desperado slapped my face in the presence of twenty spectators .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 13]: It makes me wild and murderous every time I think of it .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 10]: O.M. Good tests , both ; very good tests .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 7]: Did you try my other suggestion ?
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 72]: The one which was to prove to me that if I would leave my mind to its own devices it would find things to think about without any of my help , and thus convince me that it was a machine , an automatic machine , set in motion by exterior influences , and as independent of me as it could be if it were in some one else 's skull .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 5]: Is that the one ?
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 5]: Y.M. I tried it .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 4]: I was shaving .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 17]: I had slept well , and my mind was very lively , even gay and frisky .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 44]: It was reveling in a fantastic and joyful episode of my remote boyhood which had suddenly flashed up in my memory -- moved to this by the spectacle of a yellow cat picking its way carefully along the top of the garden wall .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 85]: The color of this cat brought the bygone cat before me , and I saw her walking along the side-step of the pulpit ; saw her walk on to a large sheet of sticky fly-paper and get all her feet involved ; saw her struggle and fall down , helpless and dissatisfied , more and more urgent , more and more unreconciled , more and more mutely profane ; saw the silent congregation quivering like jelly , and the tears running down their faces .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 5]: I saw it all .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 67]: The sight of the tears whisked my mind to a far distant and a sadder scene -- in Terra del Fuego -- and with Darwin 's eyes I saw a naked great savage hurl his little boy against the rocks for a trifling fault ; saw the poor mother gather up her dying child and hug it to her breast and weep , uttering no word .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 14]: Did my mind stop to mourn with that nude black sister of mine ?
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 26]: No -- it was far away from that scene in an instant , and was busying itself with an ever-recurring and disagreeable dream of mine .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 39]: In this dream I always find myself , stripped to my shirt , cringing and dodging about in the midst of a great drawing-room throng of finely dressed ladies and gentlemen , and wondering how I got there .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 65]: And so on and so on , picture after picture , incident after incident , a drifting panorama of ever-changing , ever-dissolving views manufactured by my mind without any help from me -- why , it would take me two hours to merely name the multitude of things my mind tallied off and photographed in fifteen minutes , let alone describe them to you .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 15]: A man 's mind , left free , has no use for his help .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 16]: But there is one way whereby he can get its help when he desires it .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 5]: What is that way ?
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 35]: When your mind is racing along from subject to subject and strikes an inspiring one , open your mouth and begin talking upon that matter -- or -- take your pen and use that .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 18]: It will interest your mind and concentrate it , and it will pursue the subject with satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 12]: It will take full charge , and furnish the words itself .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 10]: But do n't I tell it what to say ?
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 10]: There are certainly occasions when you have n't time .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 11]: The words leap out before you know what is coming .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 4]: Y.M. For instance ?
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 13]: O.M. Well , take a `` flash of wit '' -- repartee .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 6]: Flash is the right word .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 5]: It is out instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 9]: There is no time to arrange the words .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 8]: There is no thinking , no reflecting .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 16]: Where there is a wit-mechanism it is automatic in its action and needs no help .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 17]: Where the wit-mechanism is lacking , no amount of study and reflection can manufacture the product .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 11]: You really think a man originates nothing , creates nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 6]: The Thinking-Process O.M. I do .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 12]: Men perceive , and their brain-machines automatically combine the things perceived .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 4]: That is all .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 3]: The steam-engine ?
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 11]: It takes fifty men a hundred years to invent it .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 7]: One meaning of invent is discover .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 8]: I use the word in that sense .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 19]: Little by little they discover and apply the multitude of details that go to make the perfect engine .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 16]: Watt noticed that confined steam was strong enough to lift the lid of the teapot .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 22]: He did n't create the idea , he merely discovered the fact ; the cat had noticed it a hundred times .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 17]: From the teapot he evolved the cylinder -- from the displaced lid he evolved the piston-rod .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 21]: To attach something to the piston-rod to be moved by it , was a simple matter -- crank and wheel .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 8]: And so there was a working engine .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 56]: -LRB- 1 -RRB- One by one , improvements were discovered by men who used their eyes , not their creating powers -- for they had n't any -- and now , after a hundred years the patient contributions of fifty or a hundred observers stand compacted in the wonderful machine which drives the ocean liner .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 4]: A Shakespearean play ?
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 6]: The process is the same .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 7]: The first actor was a savage .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 22]: He reproduced in his theatrical war-dances , scalp-dances , and so on , incidents which he had seen in real life .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 19]: A more advanced civilization produced more incidents , more episodes ; the actor and the story-teller borrowed them .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 14]: And so the drama grew , little by little , stage by stage .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 13]: It is made up of the facts of life , not creations .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 9]: It took centuries to develop the Greek drama .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 15]: It borrowed from preceding ages ; it lent to the ages that came after .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 9]: Men observe and combine , that is all .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 5]: So does a rat .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 3]: Y.M. How ?
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 15]: He observes a smell , he infers a cheese , he seeks and finds .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 31]: The astronomer observes this and that ; adds his this and that to the this-and-thats of a hundred predecessors , infers an invisible planet , seeks it and finds it .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 28]: The rat gets into a trap ; gets out with trouble ; infers that cheese in traps lacks value , and meddles with that trap no more .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 16]: The astronomer is very proud of his achievement , the rat is proud of his .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 32]: Yet both are machines ; they have done machine work , they have originated nothing , they have no right to be vain ; the whole credit belongs to their Maker .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 19]: They are entitled to no honors , no praises , no monuments when they die , no remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 55]: One is a complex and elaborate machine , the other a simple and limited machine , but they are alike in principle , function , and process , and neither of them works otherwise than automatically , and neither of them may righteously claim a PERSONAL superiority or a personal dignity above the other .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 31]: In earned personal dignity , then , and in personal merit for what he does , it follows of necessity that he is on the same level as a rat ?
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 16]: O.M. His brother the rat ; yes , that is how it seems to me .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 38]: Neither of them being entitled to any personal merit for what he does , it follows of necessity that neither of them has a right to arrogate to himself -LRB- personally created -RRB- superiorities over his brother .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 12]: Y.M. Are you determined to go on believing in these insanities ?
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 20]: Would you go on believing in them in the face of able arguments backed by collated facts and instances ?
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 13]: O.M. I have been a humble , earnest , and sincere Truth-Seeker .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 4]: Y.M. Very well ?
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 15]: The humble , earnest , and sincere Truth-Seeker is always convertible by such means .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 23]: Y.M. I am thankful to God to hear you say this , for now I know that your conversion -- O.M. Wait .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 3]: You misunderstand .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 8]: I said I have BEEN a Truth-Seeker .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 3]: Y.M. Well ?
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 7]: O.M. I am not that now .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 4]: Have your forgotten ?
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 75]: I told you that there are none but temporary Truth-Seekers ; that a permanent one is a human impossibility ; that as soon as the Seeker finds what he is thoroughly convinced is the Truth , he seeks no further , but gives the rest of his days to hunting junk to patch it and caulk it and prop it with , and make it weather-proof and keep it from caving in on him .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 85]: Hence the Presbyterian remains a Presbyterian , the Mohammedan a Mohammedan , the Spiritualist a Spiritualist , the Democrat a Democrat , the Republican a Republican , the Monarchist a Monarchist ; and if a humble , earnest , and sincere Seeker after Truth should find it in the proposition that the moon is made of green cheese nothing could ever budge him from that position ; for he is nothing but an automatic machine , and must obey the laws of his construction .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 54]: After so -- O.M. Having found the Truth ; perceiving that beyond question man has but one moving impulse -- the contenting of his own spirit -- and is merely a machine and entitled to no personal merit for anything he does , it is not humanly possible for me to seek further .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 35]: The rest of my days will be spent in patching and painting and puttying and caulking my priceless possession and in looking the other way when an imploring argument or a damaging fact approaches .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 15]: The Marquess of Worcester had done all of this more than a century earlier .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 7]: VI Instinct and Thought Young Man .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 4]: It is odious .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 30]: Those drunken theories of yours , advanced a while ago -- concerning the rat and all that -- strip Man bare of all his dignities , grandeurs , sublimities .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 3]: Old Man .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 14]: He has n't any to strip -- they are shams , stolen clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 10]: He claims credits which belong solely to his Maker .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 15]: But you have no right to put him on a level with a rat .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 7]: O.M. I do n't -- morally .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 9]: That would not be fair to the rat .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 9]: The rat is well above him , there .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 5]: Y.M. Are you joking ?
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 7]: O.M. No , I am not .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 6]: Then what do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 10]: That comes under the head of the Moral Sense .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 6]: It is a large question .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 16]: Let us finish with what we are about now , before we take it up .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 4]: Y.M. Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 16]: You have seemed to concede that you place Man and the rat on A level .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 3]: The intellectual ?
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 7]: In form -- not a degree .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 3]: Y.M. Explain .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 46]: O.M. I think that the rat 's mind and the man 's mind are the same machine , but of unequal capacities -- like yours and Edison 's ; like the African pygmy 's and Homer 's ; like the Bushman 's and Bismarck 's .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 26]: Y.M. How are you going to make that out , when the lower animals have no mental quality but instinct , while man possesses reason ?
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 4]: What is instinct ?
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 11]: It is merely unthinking and mechanical exercise of inherited habit .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 5]: What originated the habit ?
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 12]: The first animal started it , its descendants have inherited it .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 11]: O.M. How did the first one come to start it ?
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 14]: Y.M. I do n't know ; but it did n't THINK it out .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 9]: O.M. How do you know it did n't ?
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 15]: Y.M. Well -- I have a right to suppose it did n't , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 8]: O.M. I do n't believe you have .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 4]: What is thought ?
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 27]: Y.M. I know what you call it : the mechanical and automatic putting together of impressions received from outside , and drawing an inference from them .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 4]: O.M. Very good .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 48]: Now my idea of the meaningless term `` instinct '' is , that it is merely PETRIFIED THOUGHT ; solidified and made inanimate by habit ; thought which was once alive and awake , but it become unconscious -- walks in its sleep , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 4]: Y.M. Illustrate it .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 12]: O.M. Take a herd of cows , feeding in a pasture .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 9]: Their heads are all turned in one direction .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 27]: They do that instinctively ; they gain nothing by it , they have no reason for it , they do n't know why they do it .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 34]: It is an inherited habit which was originally thought -- that is to say , observation of an exterior fact , and a valuable inference drawn from that observation and confirmed by experience .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 38]: The original wild ox noticed that with the wind in his favor he could smell his enemy in time to escape ; then he inferred that it was worth while to keep his nose to the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 9]: That is the process which man calls reasoning .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 21]: Man 's thought-machine works just like the other animals ' , but it is a better one and more Edisonian .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 32]: Man , in the ox 's place , would go further , reason wider : he would face part of the herd the other way and protect both front and rear .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 10]: Y.M. Did you stay the term instinct is meaningless ?
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 9]: O.M. I think it is a bastard word .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 44]: I think it confuses us ; for as a rule it applies itself to habits and impulses which had a far-off origin in thought , and now and then breaks the rule and applies itself to habits which can hardly claim a thought-origin .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 5]: Y.M. Give an instance .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 22]: O.M. Well , in putting on trousers a man always inserts the same old leg first -- never the other one .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 13]: There is no advantage in that , and no sense in it .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 21]: All men do it , yet no man thought it out and adopted it of set purpose , I imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 19]: But it is a habit which is transmitted , no doubt , and will continue to be transmitted .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 9]: Y.M. Can you prove that the habit exists ?
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 9]: You can prove it , if you doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 24]: If you will take a man to a clothing-store and watch him try on a dozen pairs of trousers , you will see .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 32]: The cow illustration is not -- O.M. Sufficient to show that a dumb animal 's mental machine is just the same as a man 's and its reasoning processes the same ?
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 5]: I will illustrate further .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 33]: If you should hand Mr. Edison a box which you caused to fly open by some concealed device he would infer a spring , and would hunt for it and find it .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 27]: Now an uncle of mine had an old horse who used to get into the closed lot where the corn-crib was and dishonestly take the corn .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 26]: I got the punishment myself , as it was supposed that I had heedlessly failed to insert the wooden pin which kept the gate closed .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 29]: These persistent punishments fatigued me ; they also caused me to infer the existence of a culprit , somewhere ; so I hid myself and watched the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 16]: Presently the horse came and pulled the pin out with his teeth and went in .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 16]: Nobody taught him that ; he had observed -- then thought it out for himself .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 34]: His process did not differ from Edison 's ; he put this and that together and drew an inference -- and the peg , too ; but I made him sweat for it .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 11]: It has something of the seeming of thought about it .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 7]: Still it is not very elaborate .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 2]: Enlarge .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 12]: O.M. Suppose Mr. Edison has been enjoying some one 's hospitalities .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 13]: He comes again by and by , and the house is vacant .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 8]: He infers that his host has moved .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 30]: A while afterward , in another town , he sees the man enter a house ; he infers that that is the new home , and follows to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 17]: Here , now , is the experience of a gull , as related by a naturalist .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 14]: The scene is a Scotch fishing village where the gulls were kindly treated .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 41]: This particular gull visited a cottage ; was fed ; came next day and was fed again ; came into the house , next time , and ate with the family ; kept on doing this almost daily , thereafter .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 24]: But , once the gull was away on a journey for a few days , and when it returned the house was vacant .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 11]: Its friends had removed to a village three miles distant .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 34]: Several months later it saw the head of the family on the street there , followed him home , entered the house without excuse or apology , and became a daily guest again .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 25]: Gulls do not rank high mentally , but this one had memory and the reasoning faculty , you see , and applied them Edisonially .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 14]: Yet it was not an Edison and could n't be developed into one .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 4]: O.M. Perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 3]: Could you ?
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 7]: That is neither here nor there .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 3]: Go on .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 41]: If Edison were in trouble and a stranger helped him out of it and next day he got into the same difficulty again , he would infer the wise thing to do in case he knew the stranger 's address .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 16]: Here is a case of a bird and a stranger as related by a naturalist .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 24]: An Englishman saw a bird flying around about his dog 's head , down in the grounds , and uttering cries of distress .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 8]: He went there to see about it .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 12]: The dog had a young bird in his mouth -- unhurt .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 16]: The gentleman rescued it and put it on a bush and brought the dog away .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 74]: Early the next morning the mother bird came for the gentleman , who was sitting on his veranda , and by its maneuvers persuaded him to follow it to a distant part of the grounds -- flying a little way in front of him and waiting for him to catch up , and so on ; and keeping to the winding path , too , instead of flying the near way across lots .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 8]: The distance covered was four hundred yards .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 24]: The same dog was the culprit ; he had the young bird again , and once more he had to give it up .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 43]: Now the mother bird had reasoned it all out : since the stranger had helped her once , she inferred that he would do it again ; she knew where to find him , and she went upon her errand with confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 11]: Her mental processes were what Edison 's would have been .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 26]: She put this and that together -- and that is all that thought IS -- and out of them built her logical arrangement of inferences .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 10]: Edison could n't have done it any better himself .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 13]: Y.M. Do you believe that many of the dumb animals can think ?
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 28]: O.M. Yes -- the elephant , the monkey , the horse , the dog , the parrot , the macaw , the mocking-bird , and many others .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 39]: The elephant whose mate fell into a pit , and who dumped dirt and rubbish into the pit till bottom was raised high enough to enable the captive to step out , was equipped with the reasoning quality .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 36]: I conceive that all animals that can learn things through teaching and drilling have to know how to observe , and put this and that together and draw an inference -- the process of thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 28]: Could you teach an idiot of manuals of arms , and to advance , retreat , and go through complex field maneuvers at the word of command ?
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 9]: Y.M. Not if he were a thorough idiot .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 19]: O.M. Well , canary-birds can learn all that ; dogs and elephants learn all sorts of wonderful things .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 53]: They must surely be able to notice , and to put things together , and say to themselves , `` I get the idea , now : when I do so and so , as per order , I am praised and fed ; when I do differently I am punished . ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 11]: Fleas can be taught nearly anything that a Congressman can .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 28]: Y.M. Granting , then , that dumb animals are able to think upon a low plane , is there any that can think upon a high one ?
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 10]: Is there one that is well up toward man ?
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 56]: As a thinker and planner the ant is the equal of any savage race of men ; as a self-educated specialist in several arts she is the superior of any savage race of men ; and in one or two high mental qualities she is above the reach of any man , savage or civilized !
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 5]: Y.M. Oh , come !
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 12]: you are abolishing the intellectual frontier which separates man and beast .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 6]: O.M. I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 9]: One can not abolish what does not exist .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 9]: You are not in earnest , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 13]: You can not mean to seriously say there is no such frontier .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 7]: O.M. I do say it seriously .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 45]: The instances of the horse , the gull , the mother bird , and the elephant show that those creatures put their this 's and thats together just as Edison would have done it and drew the same inferences that he would have drawn .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 14]: Their mental machinery was just like his , also its manner of working .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 22]: Their equipment was as inferior to the Strasburg clock , but that is the only difference -- there is no frontier .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 10]: It looks exasperatingly true ; and is distinctly offensive .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 41]: It elevates the dumb beasts to -- to -- O.M. Let us drop that lying phrase , and call them the Unrevealed Creatures ; so far as we can know , there is no such thing as a dumb beast .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 10]: Y.M. On what grounds do you make that assertion ?
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 6]: O.M. On quite simple ones .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 28]: `` Dumb '' beast suggests an animal that has no thought-machinery , no understanding , no speech , no way of communicating what is in its mind .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 8]: We know that a hen HAS speech .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 19]: We can not understand everything she says , but we easily learn two or three of her phrases .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 53]: We know when she is saying , `` I have laid an egg '' ; we know when she is saying to the chicks , `` Run here , dears , I 've found a worm '' ; we know what she is saying when she voices a warning : `` Quick !
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 2]: hurry !
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 12]: gather yourselves under mamma , there 's a hawk coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 51]: We understand the cat when she stretches herself out , purring with affection and contentment and lifts up a soft voice and says , `` Come , kitties , supper 's ready '' ; we understand her when she goes mourning about and says , `` Where can they be ?
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 4]: They are lost .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 10]: Wo n't you help me hunt for them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 36]: and we understand the disreputable Tom when he challenges at midnight from his shed , `` You come over here , you product of immoral commerce , and I 'll make your fur fly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 33]: We understand a few of a dog 's phrases and we learn to understand a few of the remarks and gestures of any bird or other animal that we domesticate and observe .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 42]: The clearness and exactness of the few of the hen 's speeches which we understand is argument that she can communicate to her kind a hundred things which we can not comprehend -- in a word , that she can converse .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 19]: And this argument is also applicable in the case of others of the great army of the Unrevealed .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 23]: It is just like man 's vanity and impertinence to call an animal dumb because it is dumb to his dull perceptions .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 40]: Now as to the ant -- Y.M. Yes , go back to the ant , the creature that -- as you seem to think -- sweeps away the last vestige of an intellectual frontier between man and the Unrevealed .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 7]: That is what she surely does .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 18]: In all his history the aboriginal Australian never thought out a house for himself and built it .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 7]: The ant is an amazing architect .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 46]: She is a wee little creature , but she builds a strong and enduring house eight feet high -- a house which is as large in proportion to her size as is the largest capitol or cathedral in the world compared to man 's size .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 16]: No savage race has produced architects who could approach the air in genius or culture .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 20]: No civilized race has produced architects who could plan a house better for the uses proposed than can hers .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 50]: Her house contains a throne-room ; nurseries for her young ; granaries ; apartments for her soldiers , her workers , etc. ; and they and the multifarious halls and corridors which communicate with them are arranged and distributed with an educated and experienced eye for convenience and adaptability .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 6]: That could be mere instinct .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 10]: It would elevate the savage if he had it .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 9]: But let us look further before we decide .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 26]: The ant has soldiers -- battalions , regiments , armies ; and they have their appointed captains and generals , who lead them to battle .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 7]: That could be instinct , too .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 6]: We will look still further .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 21]: The ant has a system of government ; it is well planned , elaborate , and is well carried on .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 4]: Y.M. Instinct again .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 17]: She has crowds of slaves , and is a hard and unjust employer of forced labor .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 3]: Y.M. Instinct .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 8]: She has cows , and milks them .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 6]: Y.M. Instinct , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 28]: In Texas she lays out a farm twelve feet square , plants it , weeds it , cultivates it , gathers the crop and stores it away .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 7]: Y.M. Instinct , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 8]: The ant discriminates between friend and stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 31]: Sir John Lubbock took ants from two different nests , made them drunk with whiskey and laid them , unconscious , by one of the nests , near some water .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 24]: Ants from the nest came and examined and discussed these disgraced creatures , then carried their friends home and threw the strangers overboard .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 10]: Sir John repeated the experiment a number of times .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 24]: For a time the sober ants did as they had done at first -- carried their friends home and threw the strangers overboard .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 23]: But finally they lost patience , seeing that their reformatory efforts went for nothing , and threw both friends and strangers overboard .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 38]: Come -- is this instinct , or is it thoughtful and intelligent discussion of a thing new -- absolutely new -- to their experience ; with a verdict arrived at , sentence passed , and judgment executed ?
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 4]: Is it instinct ?
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 25]: -- thought petrified by ages of habit -- or is n't it brand-new thought , inspired by the new occasion , the new circumstances ?
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 7]: Y.M. I have to concede it .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 29]: It was not a result of habit ; it has all the look of reflection , thought , putting this and that together , as you phrase it .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 6]: I believe it was thought .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 10]: O.M. I will give you another instance of thought .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 13]: Franklin had a cup of sugar on a table in his room .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 6]: The ants got at it .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 12]: He tried several preventives ; and ants rose superior to them .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 35]: Finally he contrived one which shut off access -- probably set the table 's legs in pans of water , or drew a circle of tar around the cup , I do n't remember .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 13]: At any rate , he watched to see what they would do .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 10]: They tried various schemes -- failures , every one .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 6]: The ants were badly puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 24]: Finally they held a consultation , discussed the problem , arrived at a decision -- and this time they beat that great philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 38]: They formed in procession , cross the floor , climbed the wall , marched across the ceiling to a point just over the cup , then one by one they let go and fell down into it !
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 12]: Was that instinct -- thought petrified by ages of inherited habit ?
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 10]: Y.M. No , I do n't believe it was .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 14]: I believe it was a newly reasoned scheme to meet a new emergency .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 4]: O.M. Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 10]: You have conceded the reasoning power in two instances .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 21]: I come now to a mental detail wherein the ant is a long way the superior of any human being .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 32]: Sir John Lubbock proved by many experiments that an ant knows a stranger ant of her own species in a moment , even when the stranger is disguised -- with paint .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 18]: Also he proved that an ant knows every individual in her hive of five hundred thousand souls .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 29]: Also , after a year 's absence one of the five hundred thousand she will straightway recognize the returned absentee and grace the recognition with a affectionate welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 6]: How are these recognitions made ?
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 10]: Not by color , for painted ants were recognized .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 15]: Not by smell , for ants that had been dipped in chloroform were recognized .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 27]: Not by speech and not by antennae signs nor contacts , for the drunken and motionless ants were recognized and the friend discriminated from the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 33]: The ants were all of the same species , therefore the friends had to be recognized by form and feature -- friends who formed part of a hive of five hundred thousand !
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 12]: Has any man a memory for form and feature approaching that ?
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 4]: Y.M. Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 37]: O.M. Franklin 's ants and Lubbuck 's ants show fine capacities of putting this and that together in new and untried emergencies and deducting smart conclusions from the combinations -- a man 's mental process exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 84]: With memory to help , man preserves his observations and reasonings , reflects upon them , adds to them , recombines , and so proceeds , stage by stage , to far results -- from the teakettle to the ocean greyhound 's complex engine ; from personal labor to slave labor ; from wigwam to palace ; from the capricious chase to agriculture and stored food ; from nomadic life to stable government and concentrated authority ; from incoherent hordes to massed armies .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 39]: The ant has observation , the reasoning faculty , and the preserving adjunct of a prodigious memory ; she has duplicated man 's development and the essential features of his civilization , and you call it all instinct !
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 9]: Y.M. Perhaps I lacked the reasoning faculty myself .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 15]: O.M. Well , do n't tell anybody , and do n't do it again .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 7]: We have come a good way .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 28]: As a result -- as I understand it -- I am required to concede that there is absolutely no intellectual frontier separating Man and the Unrevealed Creatures ?
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 9]: That is what you are required to concede .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 15]: There is no such frontier -- there is no way to get around that .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 27]: Man has a finer and more capable machine in him than those others , but it is the same machine and works in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 38]: And neither he nor those others can command the machine -- it is strictly automatic , independent of control , works when it pleases , and when it does n't please , it ca n't be forced .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 36]: Then man and the other animals are all alike , as to mental machinery , and there is n't any difference of any stupendous magnitude between them , except in quality , not in kind .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 10]: That is about the state of it -- intellectuality .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 8]: There are pronounced limitations on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 30]: We ca n't learn to understand much of their language , but the dog , the elephant , etc. , learn to understand a very great deal of ours .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 8]: To that extent they are our superiors .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 34]: On the other hand , they ca n't learn reading , writing , etc. , nor any of our fine and high things , and there we have a large advantage over them .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 26]: Y.M. Very well , let them have what they 've got , and welcome ; there is still a wall , and a lofty one .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 20]: They have n't got the Moral Sense ; we have it , and it lifts us immeasurably above them .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 6]: What makes you think that ?
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 10]: Now look here -- let 's call a halt .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 31]: I have stood the other infamies and insanities and that is enough ; I am not going to have man and the other animals put on the same level morally .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 12]: O.M. I was n't going to hoist man up to that .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 5]: This is too much !
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 12]: I think it is not right to jest about such things .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 20]: O.M. I am not jesting , I am merely reflecting a plain and simple truth -- and without uncharitableness .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 36]: The fact that man knows right from wrong proves his INTELLECTUAL superiority to the other creatures ; but the fact that he can DO wrong proves his MORAL inferiority to any creature that CAN NOT .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 11]: It is my belief that this position is not assailable .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 4]: Free Will Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 8]: What is your opinion regarding Free Will ?
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 7]: That there is no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 20]: Did the man possess it who gave the old woman his last shilling and trudged home in the storm ?
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 15]: He had the choice between succoring the old woman and leaving her to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 5]: Is n't it so ?
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 28]: O.M. Yes , there was a choice to be made , between bodily comfort on the one hand and the comfort of the spirit on the other .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 27]: The body made a strong appeal , of course -- the body would be quite sure to do that ; the spirit made a counter appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 15]: A choice had to be made between the two appeals , and was made .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 7]: Who or what determined that choice ?
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 23]: Y.M. Any one but you would say that the man determined it , and that in doing it he exercised Free Will .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 34]: We are constantly assured that every man is endowed with Free Will , and that he can and must exercise it where he is offered a choice between good conduct and less-good conduct .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 60]: Yet we clearly saw that in that man 's case he really had no Free Will : his temperament , his training , and the daily influences which had molded him and made him what he was , COMPELLED him to rescue the old woman and thus save HIMSELF -- save himself from spiritual pain , from unendurable wretchedness .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 20]: He did not make the choice , it was made FOR him by forces which he could not control .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 21]: Free Will has always existed in WORDS , but it stops there , I think -- stops short of FACT .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 13]: I would not use those words -- Free Will -- but others .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 3]: What others ?
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 4]: O.M. Free Choice .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 5]: What is the difference ?
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 36]: The one implies untrammeled power to ACT as you please , the other implies nothing beyond a mere MENTAL PROCESS : the critical ability to determine which of two things is nearest right and just .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 8]: Y.M. Make the difference clear , please .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 21]: The mind can freely SELECT , CHOOSE , POINT OUT the right and just one -- its function stops there .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 9]: It can go no further in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 20]: It has no authority to say that the right one shall be acted upon and the wrong one discarded .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 7]: That authority is in other hands .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 4]: The man 's ?
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 8]: In the machine which stands for him .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 18]: In his born disposition and the character which has been built around it by training and environment .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 11]: It will act upon the right one of the two ?
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 10]: It will do as it pleases in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 19]: George Washington 's machine would act upon the right one ; Pizarro would act upon the wrong one .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 78]: Then as I understand it a bad man 's mental machinery calmly and judicially points out which of two things is right and just -- O.M. Yes , and his MORAL machinery will freely act upon the other or the other , according to its make , and be quite indifferent to the MIND 'S feeling concerning the matter -- that is , WOULD be , if the mind had any feelings ; which it has n't .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 22]: It is merely a thermometer : it registers the heat and the cold , and cares not a farthing about either .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 25]: Then we must not claim that if a man KNOWS which of two things is right he is absolutely BOUND to do that thing ?
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 32]: O.M. His temperament and training will decide what he shall do , and he will do it ; he can not help himself , he has no authority over the mater .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 13]: Was n't it right for David to go out and slay Goliath ?
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 15]: Then it would have been equally RIGHT for any one else to do it ?
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 3]: Y.M. Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 14]: Then it would have been RIGHT for a born coward to attempt it ?
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 5]: It would -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 16]: You know that no born coward ever would have attempted it , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 29]: You know that a born coward 's make and temperament would be an absolute and insurmountable bar to his ever essaying such a thing , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 7]: Y.M. Yes , I know it .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 12]: He clearly perceives that it would be RIGHT to try it ?
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 17]: O.M. His mind has Free Choice in determining that it would be RIGHT to try it ?
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 22]: Then if by reason of his inborn cowardice he simply can NOT essay it , what becomes of his Free Will ?
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 6]: Where is his Free Will ?
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 17]: Why claim that he has Free Will when the plain facts show that he has n't ?
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 17]: Why content that because he and David SEE the right alike , both must ACT alike ?
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 10]: Why impose the same laws upon goat and lion ?
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 10]: There is really no such thing as Free Will ?
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 6]: It is what I think .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 4]: There is WILL .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 21]: But it has nothing to do with INTELLECTUAL PERCEPTIONS OF RIGHT AND WRONG , and is not under their command .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 27]: David 's temperament and training had Will , and it was a compulsory force ; David had to obey its decrees , he had no choice .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 30]: The coward 's temperament and training possess Will , and IT is compulsory ; it commands him to avoid danger , and he obeys , he has no choice .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 29]: But neither the Davids nor the cowards possess Free Will -- will that may do the right or do the wrong , as their MENTAL verdict shall decide .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 9]: Not Two Values , But Only One Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 24]: There is one thing which bothers me : I ca n't tell where you draw the line between MATERIAL covetousness and SPIRITUAL covetousness .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 7]: O.M. I do n't draw any .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 6]: Y.M. How do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 9]: There is no such thing as MATERIAL covetousness .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 5]: All covetousness is spiritual .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 12]: Y.M. ALL longings , desires , ambitions SPIRITUAL , never material ?
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 18]: The Master in you requires that in ALL cases you shall content his SPIRIT -- that alone .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 15]: He never requires anything else , he never interests himself in any other matter .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 5]: Y.M. Ah , come !
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 16]: When he covets somebody 's money -- is n't that rather distinctly material and gross ?
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 3]: O.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 18]: The money is merely a symbol -- it represents in visible and concrete form a SPIRITUAL DESIRE .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 30]: Any so-called material thing that you want is merely a symbol : you want it not for ITSELF , but because it will content your spirit for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 4]: Y.M. Please particularize .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 4]: O.M. Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 10]: Maybe the thing longed for is a new hat .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 13]: You get it and your vanity is pleased , your spirit contented .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 41]: Suppose your friends deride the hat , make fun of it : at once it loses its value ; you are ashamed of it , you put it out of your sight , you never want to see it again .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 6]: Y.M. I think I see .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 3]: Go on .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 10]: It is the same hat , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 7]: It is in no way altered .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 25]: But it was n't the HAT you wanted , but only what it stood for -- a something to please and content your SPIRIT .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 14]: When it failed of that , the whole of its value was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 12]: There are no MATERIAL values ; there are only spiritual ones .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 21]: You will hunt in vain for a material value that is ACTUAL , REAL -- there is no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 33]: The only value it possesses , for even a moment , is the spiritual value back of it : remove that end and it is at once worthless -- like the hat .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 8]: Y.M. Can you extend that to money ?
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 3]: O.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 28]: It is merely a symbol , it has no MATERIAL value ; you think you desire it for its own sake , but it is not so .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 25]: You desire it for the spiritual content it will bring ; if it fail of that , you discover that its value is gone .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 54]: There is that pathetic tale of the man who labored like a slave , unresting , unsatisfied , until he had accumulated a fortune , and was happy over it , jubilant about it ; then in a single week a pestilence swept away all whom he held dear and left him desolate .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 7]: His money 's value was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 37]: He realized that his joy in it came not from the money itself , but from the spiritual contentment he got out of his family 's enjoyment of the pleasures and delights it lavished upon them .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 18]: Money has no MATERIAL value ; if you remove its spiritual value nothing is left but dross .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 20]: It is so with all things , little or big , majestic or trivial -- there are no exceptions .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 43]: Crowns , scepters , pennies , paste jewels , village notoriety , world-wide fame -- they are all the same , they have no MATERIAL value : while they content the SPIRIT they are precious , when this fails they are worthless .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 5]: A Difficult Question Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 14]: You keep me confused and perplexed all the time by your elusive terminology .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 38]: Sometimes you divide a man up into two or three separate personalities , each with authorities , jurisdictions , and responsibilities of its own , and when he is in that condition I ca n't grasp it .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 25]: Now when _ I _ speak of a man , he is THE WHOLE THING IN ONE , and easy to hold and contemplate .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 9]: That is pleasant and convenient , if true .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 15]: When you speak of `` my body '' who is the `` my '' ?
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 7]: It is the `` me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 13]: The body is a property then , and the Me owns it .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 5]: Who is the Me ?
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 23]: The Me is THE WHOLE THING ; it is a common property ; an undivided ownership , vested in the whole entity .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 27]: If the Me admires a rainbow , is it the whole Me that admires it , including the hair , hands , heels , and all ?
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 4]: Y.M. Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 8]: It is my MIND that admires it .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 7]: So YOU divide the Me yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 6]: Everybody does ; everybody must .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 10]: What , then , definitely , is the Me ?
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 18]: Y.M. I think it must consist of just those two parts -- the body and the mind .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 4]: You think so ?
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 22]: If you say `` I believe the world is round , '' who is the `` I '' that is speaking ?
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 3]: The mind .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 21]: If you say `` I grieve for the loss of my father , '' who is the `` I '' ?
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 3]: The mind .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 21]: O.M. Is the mind exercising an intellectual function when it examines and accepts the evidence that the world is round ?
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 17]: O.M. Is it exercising an intellectual function when it grieves for the loss of your father ?
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 14]: That is not cerebration , brain-work , it is a matter of FEELING .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 15]: Then its source is not in your mind , but in your MORAL territory ?
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 7]: Y.M. I have to grant it .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 11]: O.M. Is your mind a part of your PHYSICAL equipment ?
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 10]: It is independent of it ; it is spiritual .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 13]: O.M. Being spiritual , it can not be affected by physical influences ?
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 12]: O.M. Does the mind remain sober with the body is drunk ?
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 5]: Y.M. Well -- no .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 9]: There IS a physical effect present , then ?
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 5]: It looks like it .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 10]: A cracked skull has resulted in a crazy mind .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 16]: Why should it happen if the mind is spiritual , and INDEPENDENT of physical influences ?
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 8]: Y.M. Well -- I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 15]: When you have a pain in your foot , how do you know it ?
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 5]: Y.M. I feel it .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 16]: But you do not feel it until a nerve reports the hurt to the brain .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 14]: Yet the brain is the seat of the mind , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 5]: Y.M. I think so .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 21]: But is n't spiritual enough to learn what is happening in the outskirts without the help of the PHYSICAL messenger ?
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 21]: You perceive that the question of who or what the Me is , is not a simple one at all .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 38]: You say `` I admire the rainbow , '' and `` I believe the world is round , '' and in these cases we find that the Me is not speaking , but only the MENTAL part .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 23]: You say , `` I grieve , '' and again the Me is not all speaking , but only the MORAL part .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 30]: You say the mind is wholly spiritual ; then you say `` I have a pain '' and find that this time the Me is mental AND spiritual combined .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 19]: We all use the `` I '' in this indeterminate fashion , there is no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 39]: We imagine a Master and King over what you call The Whole Thing , and we speak of him as `` I , '' but when we try to define him we find we can not do it .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 80]: The intellect and the feelings can act quite INDEPENDENTLY of each other ; we recognize that , and we look around for a Ruler who is master over both , and can serve as a DEFINITE AND INDISPUTABLE `` I , '' and enable us to know what we mean and who or what we are talking about when we use that pronoun , but we have to give it up and confess that we can not find him .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 86]: To me , Man is a machine , made up of many mechanisms , the moral and mental ones acting automatically in accordance with the impulses of an interior Master who is built out of born-temperament and an accumulation of multitudinous outside influences and trainings ; a machine whose ONE function is to secure the spiritual contentment of the Master , be his desires good or be they evil ; a machine whose Will is absolute and must be obeyed , and always IS obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 8]: Y.M. Maybe the Me is the Soul ?
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 5]: O.M. Maybe it is .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 5]: What is the Soul ?
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 6]: Y.M. I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 7]: O.M. Neither does any one else .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 5]: The Master Passion Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 5]: What is the Master ?
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 10]: -- or , in common speech , the Conscience ?
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 3]: Explain it .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 20]: It is that mysterious autocrat , lodged in a man , which compels the man to content its desires .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 13]: It may be called the Master Passion -- the hunger for Self-Approval .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 6]: Y.M. Where is its seat ?
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 6]: In man 's moral constitution .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 10]: Y.M. Are its commands for the man 's good ?
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 23]: It is indifferent to the man 's good ; it never concerns itself about anything but the satisfying of its own desires .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 33]: It can be TRAINED to prefer things which will be for the man 's good , but it will prefer them only because they will content IT better than other things would .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 27]: Then even when it is trained to high ideals it is still looking out for its own contentment , and not for the man 's good .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 3]: O.M. True .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 20]: Trained or untrained , it cares nothing for the man 's good , and never concerns itself about it .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 15]: It seems to be an IMMORAL force seated in the man 's moral constitution .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 13]: It is a COLORLESS force seated in the man 's moral constitution .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 49]: Let us call it an instinct -- a blind , unreasoning instinct , which can not and does not distinguish between good morals and bad ones , and cares nothing for results to the man provided its own contentment be secured ; and it will ALWAYS secure that .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 17]: It seeks money , and it probably considers that that is an advantage for the man ?
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 23]: It is not always seeking money , it is not always seeking power , nor office , nor any other MATERIAL advantage .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 17]: In ALL cases it seeks a SPIRITUAL contentment , let the MEANS be what they may .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 17]: Its desires are determined by the man 's temperament -- and it is lord over that .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 18]: Temperament , Conscience , Susceptibility , Spiritual Appetite , are , in fact , the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 13]: Have you ever heard of a person who cared nothing for money ?
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 24]: A scholar who would not leave his garret and his books to take a place in a business house at a large salary .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 26]: He had to satisfy his master -- that is to say , his temperament , his Spiritual Appetite -- and it preferred books to money .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 5]: Are there other cases ?
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 6]: Y.M. Yes , the hermit .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 6]: It is a good instance .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 41]: The hermit endures solitude , hunger , cold , and manifold perils , to content his autocrat , who prefers these things , and prayer and contemplation , to money or to any show or luxury that money can buy .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 4]: Are there others ?
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 3]: Y.M. Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 9]: The artist , the poet , the scientist .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 28]: Their autocrat prefers the deep pleasures of these occupations , either well paid or ill paid , to any others in the market , at any price .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 32]: You REALIZE that the Master Passion -- the contentment of the spirit -- concerns itself with many things besides so-called material advantage , material prosperity , cash , and all that ?
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 8]: Y.M. I think I must concede it .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 6]: O.M. I believe you must .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 26]: There are perhaps as many Temperaments that would refuse the burdens and vexations and distinctions of public office as there are that hunger after them .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 27]: The one set of Temperaments seek the contentment of the spirit , and that alone ; and this is exactly the case with the other set .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 11]: Neither set seeks anything BUT the contentment of the spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 27]: If the one is sordid , both are sordid ; and equally so , since the end in view is precisely the same in both cases .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 17]: And in both cases Temperament decides the preference -- and Temperament is BORN , not made .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 3]: Conclusion O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 7]: You have been taking a holiday ?
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 10]: Y.M. Yes ; a mountain tramp covering a week .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 6]: Are you ready to talk ?
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 4]: O.M. Quite ready .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 6]: What shall we begin with ?
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 28]: Y.M. Well , lying abed resting up , two days and nights , I have thought over all these talks , and passed them carefully in review .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 20]: With this result : that ... that ... are you intending to publish your notions about Man some day ?
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 29]: Now and then , in these past twenty years , the Master inside of me has half-intended to order me to set them to paper and publish them .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 25]: Do I have to tell you why the order has remained unissued , or can you explain so simply a thing without my help ?
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 27]: Y.M. By your doctrine , it is simplicity itself : outside influences moved your interior Master to give the order ; stronger outside influences deterred him .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 29]: Without the outside influences , neither of these impulses could ever have been born , since a person 's brain is incapable or originating an idea within itself .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 3]: O.M. Correct .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 3]: Go on .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 14]: The matter of publishing or withholding is still in your Master 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 24]: If some day an outside influence shall determine him to publish , he will give the order , and it will be obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 4]: That is correct .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 2]: Well ?
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 19]: Y.M. Upon reflection I have arrived at the conviction that the publication of your doctrines would be harmful .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 5]: Do you pardon me ?
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 4]: O.M. Pardon YOU ?
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 5]: You have done nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 8]: You are an instrument -- a speaking-trumpet .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 11]: Speaking-trumpets are not responsible for what is said through them .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 37]: Outside influences -- in the form of lifelong teachings , trainings , notions , prejudices , and other second-hand importations -- have persuaded the Master within you that the publication of these doctrines would be harmful .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 20]: Very well , this is quite natural , and was to be expected ; in fact , was inevitable .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 31]: Go on ; for the sake of ease and convenience , stick to habit : speak in the first person , and tell me what your Master thinks about it .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 21]: Y.M. Well , to begin : it is a desolating doctrine ; it is not inspiring , enthusing , uplifting .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 96]: It takes the glory out of man , it takes the pride out of him , it takes the heroism out of him , it denies him all personal credit , all applause ; it not only degrades him to a machine , but allows him no control over the machine ; makes a mere coffee-mill of him , and neither permits him to supply the coffee nor turn the crank , his sole and piteously humble function being to grind coarse or fine , according to his make , outside impulses doing the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 5]: It is correctly stated .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 12]: Tell me -- what do men admire most in each other ?
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 35]: Y.M. Intellect , courage , majesty of build , beauty of countenance , charity , benevolence , magnanimity , kindliness , heroism , and -- and -- O.M. I would not go any further .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 4]: These are ELEMENTALS .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 69]: Virtue , fortitude , holiness , truthfulness , loyalty , high ideals -- these , and all the related qualities that are named in the dictionary , are MADE OF THE ELEMENTALS , by blendings , combinations , and shadings of the elementals , just as one makes green by blending blue and yellow , and makes several shades and tints of red by modifying the elemental red .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 25]: There are several elemental colors ; they are all in the rainbow ; out of them we manufacture and name fifty shades of them .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 26]: You have named the elementals of the human rainbow , and also one BLEND -- heroism , which is made out of courage and magnanimity .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 18]: Very well , then ; which of these elements does the possessor of it manufacture for himself ?
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 4]: Is it intellect ?
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 3]: O.M. Why ?
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 6]: He is born with it .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 5]: O.M. Is it courage ?
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 6]: He is born with it .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 11]: O.M. Is it majesty of build , beauty of countenance ?
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 4]: They are birthrights .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 61]: O.M. Take those others -- the elemental moral qualities -- charity , benevolence , magnanimity , kindliness ; fruitful seeds , out of which spring , through cultivation by outside influences , all the manifold blends and combinations of virtues named in the dictionaries : does man manufacture any of those seeds , or are they all born in him ?
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 5]: Y.M. Born in him .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 7]: O.M. Who manufactures them , then ?
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 3]: Y.M. God .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 9]: O.M. Where does the credit of it belong ?
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 4]: Y.M. To God .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 13]: O.M. And the glory of which you spoke , and the applause ?
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 4]: Y.M. To God .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 8]: Then it is YOU who degrade man .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 44]: You make him claim glory , praise , flattery , for every valuable thing he possesses -- BORROWED finery , the whole of it ; no rag of it earned by himself , not a detail of it produced by his own labor .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 13]: YOU make man a humbug ; have I done worse by him ?
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 8]: You have made a machine of him .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 14]: O.M. Who devised that cunning and beautiful mechanism , a man 's hand ?
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 3]: Y.M. God .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 38]: O.M. Who devised the law by which it automatically hammers out of a piano an elaborate piece of music , without error , while the man is thinking about something else , or talking to a friend ?
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 3]: Y.M. God .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 6]: O.M. Who devised the blood ?
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 29]: Who devised the wonderful machinery which automatically drives its renewing and refreshing streams through the body , day and night , without assistance or advice from the man ?
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 40]: Who devised the man 's mind , whose machinery works automatically , interests itself in what it pleases , regardless of its will or desire , labors all night when it likes , deaf to his appeals for mercy ?
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 6]: God devised all these things .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 16]: _ I _ have not made man a machine , God made him a machine .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 12]: I am merely calling attention to the fact , nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 10]: Is it wrong to call attention to the fact ?
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 5]: Is it a crime ?
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 17]: Y.M. I think it is wrong to EXPOSE a fact when harm can come of it .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 4]: O.M. Go on .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 10]: Y.M. Look at the matter as it stands now .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 46]: Man has been taught that he is the supreme marvel of the Creation ; he believes it ; in all the ages he has never doubted it , whether he was a naked savage , or clothed in purple and fine linen , and civilized .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 11]: This has made his heart buoyant , his life cheery .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 63]: His pride in himself , his sincere admiration of himself , his joy in what he supposed were his own and unassisted achievements , and his exultation over the praise and applause which they evoked -- these have exalted him , enthused him , ambitioned him to higher and higher flights ; in a word , made his life worth the living .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 66]: But by your scheme , all this is abolished ; he is degraded to a machine , he is a nobody , his noble prides wither to mere vanities ; let him strive as he may , he can never be any better than his humblest and stupidest neighbor ; he would never be cheerful again , his life would not be worth the living .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 5]: You really think that ?
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 5]: Y.M. I certainly do .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 10]: O.M. Have you ever seen me uncheerful , unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 3]: Y.M. No .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 10]: O.M. Well , _ I _ believe these things .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 8]: Why have they not made me unhappy ?
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 10]: Y.M. Oh , well -- temperament , of course !
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 9]: You never let THAT escape from your scheme .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 4]: That is correct .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 31]: If a man is born with an unhappy temperament , nothing can make him happy ; if he is born with a happy temperament , nothing can make him unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 13]: Y.M. What -- not even a degrading and heart-chilling system of beliefs ?
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 3]: O.M. Beliefs ?
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 3]: Mere beliefs ?
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 3]: Mere convictions ?
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 4]: They are powerless .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 8]: They strive in vain against inborn temperament .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 12]: Y.M. I ca n't believe that , and I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 2]: O.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 6]: Now you are speaking hastily .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 11]: It shows that you have not studiously examined the facts .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 11]: Of all your intimates , which one is the happiest ?
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 5]: Is n't it Burgess ?
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 3]: Y.M. Easily .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 8]: O.M. And which one is the unhappiest ?
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 3]: Henry Adams ?
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 5]: Y.M. Without a question !
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 6]: O.M. I know them well .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 15]: They are extremes , abnormals ; their temperaments are as opposite as the poles .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 12]: Their life-histories are about alike -- but look at the results !
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 11]: Their ages are about the same -- about around fifty .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 20]: Burgess had always been buoyant , hopeful , happy ; Adams has always been cheerless , hopeless , despondent .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 11]: As young fellows both tried country journalism -- and failed .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 48]: Burgess did n't seem to mind it ; Adams could n't smile , he could only mourn and groan over what had happened and torture himself with vain regrets for not having done so and so instead of so and so -- THEN he would have succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 8]: They tried the law -- and failed .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 11]: Burgess remained happy -- because he could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 11]: Adams was wretched -- because he could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 31]: From that day to this , those two men have gone on trying things and failing : Burgess has come out happy and cheerful every time ; Adams the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 23]: And we do absolutely know that these men 's inborn temperaments have remained unchanged through all the vicissitudes of their material affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 10]: Let us see how it is with their immaterials .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 18]: Both have been zealous Democrats ; both have been zealous Republicans ; both have been zealous Mugwumps .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 21]: Burgess has always found happiness and Adams unhappiness in these several political beliefs and in their migrations out of them .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 22]: Both of these men have been Presbyterians , Universalists , Methodists , Catholics -- then Presbyterians again , then Methodists again .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 13]: Burgess has always found rest in these excursions , and Adams unrest .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 17]: They are trying Christian Science , now , with the customary result , the inevitable result .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 15]: No political or religious belief can make Burgess unhappy or the other man happy .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 11]: I assure you it is purely a matter of temperament .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 20]: Beliefs are ACQUIREMENTS , temperaments are BORN ; beliefs are subject to change , nothing whatever can change temperament .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 2]: Y.M. .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 6]: You have instanced extreme temperaments .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 12]: O.M. Yes , the half-dozen others are modifications of the extremes .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 7]: But the law is the same .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 21]: Where the temperament is two-thirds happy , or two-thirds unhappy , no political or religious beliefs can change the proportions .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 45]: The vast majority of temperaments are pretty equally balanced ; the intensities are absent , and this enables a nation to learn to accommodate itself to its political and religious circumstances and like them , be satisfied with them , at last prefer them .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 9]: Nations do not THINK , they only FEEL .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 15]: They get their feelings at second hand through their temperaments , not their brains .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 53]: A nation can be brought -- by force of circumstances , not argument -- to reconcile itself to ANY KIND OF GOVERNMENT OR RELIGION THAT CAN BE DEVISED ; in time it will fit itself to the required conditions ; later , it will prefer them and will fiercely fight for them .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 200]: As instances , you have all history : the Greeks , the Romans , the Persians , the Egyptians , the Russians , the Germans , the French , the English , the Spaniards , the Americans , the South Americans , the Japanese , the Chinese , the Hindus , the Turks -- a thousand wild and tame religions , every kind of government that can be thought of , from tiger to house-cat , each nation KNOWING it has the only true religion and the only sane system of government , each despising all the others , each an ass and not suspecting it , each proud of its fancied supremacy , each perfectly sure it is the pet of God , each without undoubting confidence summoning Him to take command in time of war , each surprised when He goes over to the enemy , but by habit able to excuse it and resume compliments -- in a word , the whole human race content , always content , persistently content , indestructibly content , happy , thankful , proud , NO MATTER WHAT ITS RELIGION IS , NOR WHETHER ITS MASTER BE TIGER OR HOUSE-CAT .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 5]: Am I stating facts ?
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 5]: You know I am .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 6]: Is the human race cheerful ?
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 5]: You know it is .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 42]: Considering what it can stand , and be happy , you do me too much honor when you think that _ I _ can place before it a system of plain cold facts that can take the cheerfulness out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 5]: Nothing can do that .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 5]: Everything has been tried .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 3]: Without success .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 8]: I beg you not to be troubled .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 20]: THE DEATH OF JEAN The death of Jean Clemens occurred early in the morning of December 24 , 1909 .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 25]: Mr. Clemens was in great stress of mind when I first saw him , but a few hours later I found him writing steadily .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 14]: `` I am setting it down , '' he said , `` everything .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 10]: It is a relief to me to write it .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 9]: It furnishes me an excuse for thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 18]: At intervals during that day and the next I looked in , and usually found him writing .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 33]: Then on the evening of the 26th , when he knew that Jean had been laid to rest in Elmira , he came to my room with the manuscript in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 14]: `` I have finished it , '' he said ; `` read it .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 9]: I can form no opinion of it myself .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 20]: If you think it worthy , some day -- at the proper time -- it can end my autobiography .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 7]: It is the final chapter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 18]: Four months later -- almost to the day -- -LRB- April 21st -RRB- he was with Jean .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 4]: Albert Bigelow Paine .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 10]: Stormfield , Christmas Eve , 11 A.M. , 1909 .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 4]: JEAN IS DEAD !
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 35]: Has any one ever tried to put upon paper all the little happenings connected with a dear one -- happenings of the twenty-four hours preceding the sudden and unexpected death of that dear one ?
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 6]: Would a book contain them ?
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 6]: Would two books contain them ?
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 4]: I think not .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 9]: They pour into the mind in a flood .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 25]: They are little things that have been always happening every day , and were always so unimportant and easily forgettable before -- but now !
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 5]: Now , how different !
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 22]: how precious they are , now dear , how unforgettable , how pathetic , how sacred , how clothed with dignity !
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 55]: Last night Jean , all flushed with splendid health , and I the same , from the wholesome effects of my Bermuda holiday , strolled hand in hand from the dinner-table and sat down in the library and chatted , and planned , and discussed , cheerily and happily -LRB- and how unsuspectingly ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 21]: -- until nine -- which is late for us -- then went upstairs , Jean 's friendly German dog following .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 29]: At my door Jean said , `` I ca n't kiss you good night , father : I have a cold , and you could catch it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 7]: I bent and kissed her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 20]: She was moved -- I saw it in her eyes -- and she impulsively kissed my hand in return .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 12]: Then with the usual gay `` Sleep well , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 6]: from both , we parted .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 16]: At half past seven this morning I woke , and heard voices outside my door .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 22]: I said to myself , `` Jean is starting on her usual horseback flight to the station for the mail . ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 29]: Then Katy -LRB- 1 -RRB- entered , stood quaking and gasping at my bedside a moment , then found her tongue : `` MISS JEAN IS DEAD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 16]: Possibly I know now what the soldier feels when a bullet crashes through his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 22]: In her bathroom there she lay , the fair young creature , stretched upon the floor and covered with a sheet .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 13]: And looking so placid , so natural , and as if asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 6]: We knew what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 19]: She was an epileptic : she had been seized with a convulsion and heart failure in her bath .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 8]: The doctor had to come several miles .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 16]: His efforts , like our previous ones , failed to bring her back to life .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 6]: It is noon , now .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 11]: How lovable she looks , how sweet and how tranquil !
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 23]: It is a noble face , and full of dignity ; and that was a good heart that lies there so still .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 30]: In England , thirteen years ago , my wife and I were stabbed to the heart with a cablegram which said , `` Susy was mercifully released today . ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 16]: I had to send a like shot to Clara , in Berlin , this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 13]: With the peremptory addition , `` You must not come home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 14]: Clara and her husband sailed from here on the 11th of this month .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 6]: How will Clara bear it ?
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 12]: Jean , from her babyhood , was a worshiper of Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 28]: Four days ago I came back from a month 's holiday in Bermuda in perfected health ; but by some accident the reporters failed to perceive this .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 25]: Day before yesterday , letters and telegrams began to arrive from friends and strangers which indicated that I was supposed to be dangerously ill .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 13]: Yesterday Jean begged me to explain my case through the Associated Press .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 20]: I said it was not important enough ; but she was distressed and said I must think of Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 40]: Clara would see the report in the German papers , and as she had been nursing her husband day and night for four months -LRB- 2 -RRB- and was worn out and feeble , the shock might be disastrous .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 47]: There was reason in that ; so I sent a humorous paragraph by telephone to the Associated Press denying the `` charge '' that I was `` dying , '' and saying `` I would not do such a thing at my time of life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 38]: Jean was a little troubled , and did not like to see me treat the matter so lightly ; but I said it was best to treat it so , for there was nothing serious about it .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 18]: This morning I sent the sorrowful facts of this day 's irremediable disaster to the Associated Press .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 9]: Will both appear in this evening 's papers ?
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 11]: -- the one so blithe , the other so tragic ?
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 16]: I lost Susy thirteen years ago ; I lost her mother -- her incomparable mother !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 24]: -- five and a half years ago ; Clara has gone away to live in Europe ; and now I have lost Jean .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 11]: How poor I am , who was once so rich !
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 54]: Seven months ago Mr. Roger died -- one of the best friends I ever had , and the nearest perfect , as man and gentleman , I have yet met among my race ; within the last six weeks Gilder has passed away , and Laffan -- old , old friends of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 36]: Jean lies yonder , I sit here ; we are strangers under our own roof ; we kissed hands good-by at this door last night -- and it was forever , we never suspecting it .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 21]: She lies there , and I sit here -- writing , busying myself , to keep my heart from breaking .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 10]: How dazzlingly the sunshine is flooding the hills around !
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 6]: It is like a mockery .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 7]: Seventy-four years ago twenty-four days ago .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 5]: Seventy-four years old yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 7]: Who can estimate my age today ?
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 7]: I have looked upon her again .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 7]: I wonder I can bear it .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 19]: She looks just as her mother looked when she lay dead in that Florentine villa so long ago .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 6]: The sweet placidity of death !
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 7]: it is more beautiful than sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 6]: I saw her mother buried .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 26]: I said I would never endure that horror again ; that I would never again look into the grave of any one dear to me .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 6]: I have kept to that .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 34]: They will take Jean from this house tomorrow , and bear her to Elmira , New York , where lie those of us that have been released , but I shall not follow .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 16]: Jean was on the dock when the ship came in , only four days ago .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 19]: She was at the door , beaming a welcome , when I reached this house the next evening .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 19]: We played cards , and she tried to teach me a new game called `` Mark Twain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 28]: We sat chatting cheerily in the library last night , and she would n't let me look into the loggia , where she was making Christmas preparations .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 37]: She said she would finish them in the morning , and then her little French friend would arrive from New York -- the surprise would follow ; the surprise she had been working over for days .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 13]: While she was out for a moment I disloyally stole a look .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 60]: The loggia floor was clothed with rugs and furnished with chairs and sofas ; and the uncompleted surprise was there : in the form of a Christmas tree that was drenched with silver film in a most wonderful way ; and on a table was prodigal profusion of bright things which she was going to hang upon it today .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 14]: What desecrating hand will ever banish that eloquent unfinished surprise from that place ?
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 5]: Not mine , surely .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 12]: All these little matters have happened in the last four days .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 4]: `` Little . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 4]: Yes -- THEN .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 4]: But not now .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 11]: Nothing she said or thought or did is little now .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: And all the lavish humor !
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 7]: -- what is become of it ?
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 6]: It is pathos , now .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 10]: Pathos , and the thought of it brings tears .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 17]: All these little things happened such a few hours ago -- and now she lies yonder .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 10]: Lies yonder , and cares for nothing any more .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 6]: Strange -- marvelous -- incredible !
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 22]: I have had this experience before ; but it would still be incredible if I had had it a thousand times .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 7]: `` MISS JEAN IS DEAD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 6]: That is what Katy said .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 41]: When I heard the door open behind the bed 's head without a preliminary knock , I supposed it was Jean coming to kiss me good morning , she being the only person who was used to entering without formalities .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 11]: And so -- I have been to Jean 's parlor .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 11]: Such a turmoil of Christmas presents for servants and friends !
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 20]: They are everywhere ; tables , chairs , sofas , the floor -- everything is occupied , and over-occupied .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 14]: It is many and many a year since I have seen the like .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 28]: In that ancient day Mrs. Clemens and I used to slip softly into the nursery at midnight on Christmas Eve and look the array of presents over .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 6]: The children were little then .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 16]: And now here is Jean 's parlor looking just as that nursery used to look .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 18]: The presents are not labeled -- the hands are forever idle that would have labeled them today .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 12]: Jean 's mother always worked herself down with her Christmas preparations .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 19]: Jean did the same yesterday and the preceding days , and the fatigue has cost her her life .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 11]: The fatigue caused the convulsion that attacked her this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 8]: She had had no attack for months .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 19]: Jean was so full of life and energy that she was constantly is danger of overtaxing her strength .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 21]: Every morning she was in the saddle by half past seven , and off to the station for her mail .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 26]: She examined the letters and I distributed them : some to her , some to Mr. Paine , the others to the stenographer and myself .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 25]: She dispatched her share and then mounted her horse again and went around superintending her farm and her poultry the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 24]: Sometimes she played billiards with me after dinner , but she was usually too tired to play , and went early to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 22]: Yesterday afternoon I told her about some plans I had been devising while absent in Bermuda , to lighten her burdens .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 21]: We would get a housekeeper ; also we would put her share of the secretary-work into Mr. Paine 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 7]: No -- she was n't willing .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 7]: She had been making plans herself .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 10]: The matter ended in a compromise , I submitted .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 4]: I always did .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 23]: She would n't audit the bills and let Paine fill out the checks -- she would continue to attend to that herself .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 14]: Also , she would continue to be housekeeper , and let Katy assist .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 15]: Also , she would continue to answer the letters of personal friends for me .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 5]: Such was the compromise .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 24]: Both of us called it by that name , though I was not able to see where my formidable change had been made .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 13]: However , Jean was pleased , and that was sufficient for me .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 29]: She was proud of being my secretary , and I was never able to persuade her to give up any part of her share in that unlovely work .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 40]: In the talk last night I said I found everything going so smoothly that if she were willing I would go back to Bermuda in February and get blessedly out of the clash and turmoil again for another month .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 30]: She was urgent that I should do it , and said that if I would put off the trip until March she would take Katy and go with me .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 12]: We struck hands upon that , and said it was settled .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 20]: I had a mind to write to Bermuda by tomorrow 's ship and secure a furnished house and servants .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 9]: I meant to write the letter this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 9]: But it will never be written , now .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 14]: For she lies yonder , and before her is another journey than that .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 19]: Night is closing down ; the rim of the sun barely shows above the sky-line of the hills .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 19]: I have been looking at that face again that was growing dearer and dearer to me every day .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 12]: I was getting acquainted with Jean in these last nine months .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 19]: She had been long an exile from home when she came to us three-quarters of a year ago .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 13]: She had been shut up in sanitariums , many miles from us .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 15]: How eloquent glad and grateful she was to cross her father 's threshold again !
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 13]: Would I bring her back to life if I could do it ?
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 4]: I would not .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 17]: If a word would do it , I would beg for strength to withhold the word .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 13]: And I would have the strength ; I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 46]: In her loss I am almost bankrupt , and my life is a bitterness , but I am content : for she has been enriched with the most precious of all gifts -- that gift which makes all other gifts mean and poor -- death .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 17]: I have never wanted any released friend of mine restored to life since I reached manhood .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 20]: I felt in this way when Susy passed away ; and later my wife , and later Mr. Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 45]: When Clara met me at the station in New York and told me Mr. Rogers had died suddenly that morning , my thought was , Oh , favorite of fortune -- fortunate all his long and lovely life -- fortunate to his latest moment !
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 12]: The reporters said there were tears of sorrow in my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 12]: True -- but they were for ME , not for him .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 6]: He had suffered no loss .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 15]: All the fortunes he had ever made before were poverty compared with this one .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 11]: Why did I build this house , two years ago ?
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 6]: To shelter this vast emptiness ?
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 5]: How foolish I was !
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 7]: But I shall stay in it .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 12]: The spirits of the dead hallow a house , for me .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 11]: It was not so with other members of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 10]: Susy died in the house we built in Hartford .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 8]: Mrs. Clemens would never enter it again .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 9]: But it made the house dearer to me .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 27]: I have entered it once since , when it was tenantless and silent and forlorn , but to me it was a holy place and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 44]: It seemed to me that the spirits of the dead were all about me , and would speak to me and welcome me if they could : Livy , and Susy , and George , and Henry Robinson , and Charles Dudley Warner .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 13]: How good and kind they were , and how lovable their lives !
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 49]: In fancy I could see them all again , I could call the children back and hear them romp again with George -- that peerless black ex-slave and children 's idol who came one day -- a flitting stranger -- to wash windows , and stayed eighteen years .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 4]: Until he died .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 20]: Clara and Jean would never enter again the New York hotel which their mother had frequented in earlier days .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 6]: They could not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 8]: But I shall stay in this house .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 12]: It is dearer to me tonight than ever it was before .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 11]: Jean 's spirit will make it beautiful for me always .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 15]: Her lonely and tragic death -- but I will not think of that now .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 23]: Jean 's mother always devoted two or three weeks to Christmas shopping , and was always physically exhausted when Christmas Eve came .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 19]: Jean was her very own child -- she wore herself out present-hunting in New York these latter days .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 27]: Paine has just found on her desk a long list of names -- fifty , he thinks -- people to whom she sent presents last night .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 6]: Apparently she forgot no one .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 13]: And Katy found there a roll of bank-notes , for the servants .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 14]: Her dog has been wandering about the grounds today , comradeless and forlorn .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 8]: I have seen him from the windows .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 6]: She got him from Germany .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 11]: He has tall ears and looks exactly like a wolf .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 14]: He was educated in Germany , and knows no language but the German .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 10]: Jean gave him no orders save in that tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 38]: And so when the burglar-alarm made a fierce clamor at midnight a fortnight ago , the butler , who is French and knows no German , tried in vain to interest the dog in the supposed burglar .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 11]: Jean wrote me , to Bermuda , about the incident .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 19]: It was the last letter I was ever to receive from her bright head and her competent hand .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 7]: The dog will not be neglected .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 10]: There was never a kinder heart than Jean 's .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 20]: From her childhood up she always spent the most of her allowance on charities of one kind or another .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 21]: After she became secretary and had her income doubled she spent her money upon these things with a free hand .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 11]: Mine too , I am glad and grateful to say .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 30]: She was a loyal friend to all animals , and she loved them all , birds , beasts , and everything -- even snakes -- an inheritance from me .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 14]: She knew all the birds ; she was high up in that lore .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 31]: She became a member of various humane societies when she was still a little girl -- both here and abroad -- and she remained an active member to the last .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 17]: She founded two or three societies for the protection of animals , here and in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 20]: She was an embarrassing secretary , for she fished my correspondence out of the waste-basket and answered the letters .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 11]: She thought all letters deserved the courtesy of an answer .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 10]: Her mother brought her up in that kindly error .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 14]: She could write a good letter , and was swift with her pen .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 19]: She had but an indifferent ear music , but her tongue took to languages with an easy facility .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 16]: She never allowed her Italian , French , and German to get rusty through neglect .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 39]: The telegrams of sympathy are flowing in , from far and wide , now , just as they did in Italy five years and a half ago , when this child 's mother laid down her blameless life .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 16]: They can not heal the hurt , but they take away some of the pain .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 48]: When Jean and I kissed hands and parted at my door last , how little did we imagine that in twenty-two hours the telegraph would be bringing words like these : `` From the bottom of our hearts we send out sympathy , dearest of friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 27]: For many and many a day to come , wherever I go in this house , remembrancers of Jean will mutely speak to me of her .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 8]: Who can count the number of them ?
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 16]: She was in exile two years with the hope of healing her malady -- epilepsy .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 33]: There are no words to express how grateful I am that she did not meet her fate in the hands of strangers , but in the loving shelter of her own home .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 7]: `` MISS JEAN IS DEAD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 4]: It is true .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 4]: Jean is dead .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 24]: A month ago I was writing bubbling and hilarious articles for magazines yet to appear , and now I am writing -- this .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 3]: CHRISTMAS DAY .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 2]: NOON .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 89]: -- Last night I went to Jean 's room at intervals , and turned back the sheet and looked at the peaceful face , and kissed the cold brow , and remembered that heartbreaking night in Florence so long ago , in that cavernous and silent vast villa , when I crept downstairs so many times , and turned back a sheet and looked at a face just like this one -- Jean 's mother 's face -- and kissed a brow that was just like this one .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 34]: And last night I saw again what I had seen then -- that strange and lovely miracle -- the sweet , soft contours of early maidenhood restored by the gracious hand of death !
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 54]: When Jean 's mother lay dead , all trace of care , and trouble , and suffering , and the corroding years had vanished out of the face , and I was looking again upon it as I had known and worshipped it in its young bloom and beauty a whole generation before .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 106]: About three in the morning , while wandering about the house in the deep silences , as one does in times like these , when there is a dumb sense that something has been lost that will never be found again , yet must be sought , if only for the employment the useless seeking gives , I came upon Jean 's dog in the hall downstairs , and noted that he did not spring to greet me , according to his hospitable habit , but came slow and sorrowfully ; also I remembered that he had not visited Jean 's apartment since the tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 7]: Poor fellow , did he know ?
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 4]: I think so .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 35]: Always when Jean was abroad in the open he was with her ; always when she was in the house he was with her , in the night as well as in the day .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 6]: Her parlor was his bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 29]: Whenever I happened upon him on the ground floor he always followed me about , and when I went upstairs he went too -- in a tumultuous gallop .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 37]: But now it was different : after patting him a little I went to the library -- he remained behind ; when I went upstairs he did not follow me , save with his wistful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 13]: He has wonderful eyes -- big , and kind , and eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 6]: He can talk with them .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 17]: He is a beautiful creature , and is of the breed of the New York police-dogs .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 53]: I do not like dogs , because they bark when there is no occasion for it ; but I have liked this one from the beginning , because he belonged to Jean , and because he never barks except when there is occasion -- which is not oftener than twice a week .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 9]: In my wanderings I visited Jean 's parlor .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 18]: On a shelf I found a pile of my books , and I knew what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 21]: She was waiting for me to come home from Bermuda and autograph them , then she would send them away .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 10]: If I only knew whom she intended them for !
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 6]: But I shall never know .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 5]: I will keep them .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 17]: Her hand has touched them -- it is an accolade -- they are noble , now .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 26]: And in a closet she had hidden a surprise for me -- a thing I have often wished I owned : a noble big globe .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 9]: I could n't see it for the tears .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 15]: She will never know the pride I take in it , and the pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 31]: Today the mails are full of loving remembrances for her : full of those old , old kind words she loved so well , `` Merry Christmas to Jean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 10]: If she could only have lived one day longer !
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 14]: At last she ran out of money , and would not use mine .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 26]: So she sent to one of those New York homes for poor girls all the clothes she could spare -- and more , most likely .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 3]: CHRISTMAS NIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 11]: -- This afternoon they took her away from her room .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 54]: As soon as I might , I went down to the library , and there she lay , in her coffin , dressed in exactly the same clothes she wore when she stood at the other end of the same room on the 6th of October last , as Clara 's chief bridesmaid .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 29]: Her face was radiant with happy excitement then ; it was the same face now , with the dignity of death and the peace of God upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 12]: They told me the first mourner to come was the dog .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 47]: He came uninvited , and stood up on his hind legs and rested his fore paws upon the trestle , and took a last long look at the face that was so dear to him , then went his way as silently as he had come .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 3]: HE KNOWS .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 7]: At mid-afternoon it began to snow .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 12]: The pity of it -- that Jean could not see it !
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 6]: She so loved the snow .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 6]: The snow continued to fall .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 17]: At six o'clock the hearse drew up to the door to bear away its pathetic burden .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 24]: As they lifted the casket , Paine began playing on the orchestrelle Schubert 's `` Impromptu , '' which was Jean 's favorite .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 23]: Then he played the Intermezzo ; that was for Susy ; then he played the Largo ; that was for their mother .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 7]: He did this at my request .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 32]: Elsewhere in my Autobiography I have told how the Intermezzo and the Largo came to be associated in my heart with Susy and Livy in their last hours in this life .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 29]: From my windows I saw the hearse and the carriages wind along the road and gradually grow vague and spectral in the falling snow , and presently disappear .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 16]: Jean was gone out of my life , and would not come back any more .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 50]: Jervis , the cousin she had played with when they were babies together -- he and her beloved old Katy -- were conducting her to her distant childhood home , where she will lie by her mother 's side once more , in the company of Susy and Langdon .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 3]: DECEMBER 26TH .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 12]: The dog came to see me at eight o'clock this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 8]: He was very affectionate , poor orphan !
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 8]: My room will be his quarters hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 6]: The storm raged all night .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 7]: It has raged all the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 21]: The snow drives across the landscape in vast clouds , superb , sublime -- and Jean not here to see .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 9]: 2:30 P.M. -- It is the time appointed .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 5]: The funeral has begun .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 19]: Four hundred miles away , but I can see it all , just as if I were there .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 10]: The scene is the library in the Langdon homestead .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 51]: Jean 's coffin stands where her mother and I stood , forty years ago , and were married ; and where Susy 's coffin stood thirteen years ago ; where her mother 's stood five years and a half ago ; and where mine will stand after a little time .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 3]: FIVE O'CLOCK .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 6]: -- It is all over .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 28]: When Clara went away two weeks ago to live in Europe , it was hard , but I could bear it , for I had Jean left .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 8]: I said WE would be a family .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 14]: We said we would be close comrades and happy -- just we two .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 33]: That fair dream was in my mind when Jean met me at the steamer last Monday ; it was in my mind when she received me at the door last Tuesday evening .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 9]: We were together ; WE WERE A FAMILY !
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 18]: the dream had come true -- oh , precisely true , contentedly , true , satisfyingly true !
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 7]: and remained true two whole days .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 3]: And now ?
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 7]: Now Jean is in her grave !
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 10]: In the grave -- if I can believe it .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 6]: God rest her sweet spirit !
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 17]: Katy Leary , who had been in the service of the Clemens family for twenty-nine years .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 9]: Mr. Gabrilowitsch had been operated on for appendicitis .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 25]: THE TURNING-POINT OF MY LIFE I If I understand the idea , the BAZAR invites several of us to write upon the above text .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 26]: It means the change in my life 's course which introduced what must be regarded by me as the most IMPORTANT condition of my career .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 22]: But it also implies -- without intention , perhaps -- that that turning-point ITSELF was the creator of the new condition .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 15]: This gives it too much distinction , too much prominence , too much credit .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 35]: It is only the LAST link in a very long chain of turning-points commissioned to produce the cardinal result ; it is not any more important than the humblest of its ten thousand predecessors .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 46]: Each of the ten thousand did its appointed share , on its appointed date , in forwarding the scheme , and they were all necessary ; to have left out any one of them would have defeated the scheme and brought about SOME OTHER result .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 29]: It know we have a fashion of saying `` such and such an event was the turning-point in my life , '' but we should n't say it .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 34]: We should merely grant that its place as LAST link in the chain makes it the most CONSPICUOUS link ; in real importance it has no advantage over any one of its predecessors .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 15]: Perhaps the most celebrated turning-point recorded in history was the crossing of the Rubicon .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 77]: Suetonius says : Coming up with his troops on the banks of the Rubicon , he halted for a while , and , revolving in his mind the importance of the step he was on the point of taking , he turned to those about him and said , `` We may still retreat ; but if we pass this little bridge , nothing is left for us but to fight it out in arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 7]: This was a stupendously important moment .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 29]: And all the incidents , big and little , of Caesar 's previous life had been leading up to it , stage by stage , link by link .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 43]: This was the LAST link -- merely the last one , and no bigger than the others ; but as we gaze back at it through the inflating mists of our imagination , it looks as big as the orbit of Neptune .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 27]: You , the reader , have a PERSONAL interest in that link , and so have I ; so has the rest of the human race .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 20]: It was one of the links in your life-chain , and it was one of the links in mine .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 14]: We may wait , now , with bated breath , while Caesar reflects .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 10]: Your fate and mine are involved in his decision .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 11]: While he was thus hesitating , the following incident occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 22]: A person remarked for his noble mien and graceful aspect appeared close at hand , sitting and playing upon a pipe .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 57]: When not only the shepherds , but a number of soldiers also , flocked to listen to him , and some trumpeters among them , he snatched a trumpet from one of them , ran to the river with it , and , sounding the advance with a piercing blast , crossed to the other side .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 25]: Upon this , Caesar exclaimed : `` Let us go whither the omens of the gods and the iniquity of our enemies call us .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 6]: THE DIE IS CAST . ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 18]: So he crossed -- and changed the future of the whole human race , for all time .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 18]: But that stranger was a link in Caesar 's life-chain , too ; and a necessary one .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 67]: We do n't know his name , we never hear of him again ; he was very casual ; he acts like an accident ; but he was no accident , he was there by compulsion of HIS life-chain , to blow the electrifying blast that was to make up Caesar 's mind for him , and thence go piping down the aisles of history forever .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 8]: If the stranger had n't been there !
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 4]: But he WAS .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 4]: And Caesar crossed .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 4]: With such results !
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 131]: Such vast events -- each a link in the HUMAN RACE 'S life-chain ; each event producing the next one , and that one the next one , and so on : the destruction of the republic ; the founding of the empire ; the breaking up of the empire ; the rise of Christianity upon its ruins ; the spread of the religion to other lands -- and so on ; link by link took its appointed place at its appointed time , the discovery of America being one of them ; our Revolution another ; the inflow of English and other immigrants another ; their drift westward -LRB- my ancestors among them -RRB- another ; the settlement of certain of them in Missouri , which resulted in ME .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 15]: For I was one of the unavoidable results of the crossing of the Rubicon .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 31]: If the stranger , with his trumpet blast , had stayed away -LRB- which he COULD N'T , for he was the appointed link -RRB- Caesar would not have crossed .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 14]: What would have happened , in that case , we can never guess .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 14]: We only know that the things that did happen would not have happened .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 23]: They might have been replaced by equally prodigious things , of course , but their nature and results are beyond our guessing .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 29]: But the matter that interests me personally is that I would not be HERE now , but somewhere else ; and probably black -- there is no telling .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 9]: Very well , I am glad he crossed .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 18]: And very really and thankfully glad , too , though I never cared anything about it before .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 16]: II To me , the most important feature of my life is its literary feature .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 11]: I have been professionally literary something more than forty years .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 36]: There have been many turning-points in my life , but the one that was the link in the chain appointed to conduct me to the literary guild is the most CONSPICUOUS link in that chain .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 7]: BECAUSE it was the last one .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 10]: It was not any more important than its predecessors .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 38]: All the other links have an inconspicuous look , except the crossing of the Rubicon ; but as factors in making me literary they are all of the one size , the crossing of the Rubicon included .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 25]: I know how I came to be literary , and I will tell the steps that lead up to it and brought it about .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 36]: The crossing of the Rubicon was not the first one , it was hardly even a recent one ; I should have to go back ages before Caesar 's day to find the first one .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 21]: To save space I will go back only a couple of generations and start with an incident of my boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 14]: When I was twelve and a half years old , my father died .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 6]: It was in the spring .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 13]: The summer came , and brought with it an epidemic of measles .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 10]: For a time a child died almost every day .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 11]: The village was paralyzed with fright , distress , despair .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 20]: Children that were not smitten with the disease were imprisoned in their homes to save them from the infection .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 53]: In the homes there were no cheerful faces , there was no music , there was no singing but of solemn hymns , no voice but of prayer , no romping was allowed , no noise , no laughter , the family moved spectrally about on tiptoe , in a ghostly hush .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 5]: I was a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 13]: My soul was steeped in this awful dreariness -- and in fear .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 33]: At some time or other every day and every night a sudden shiver shook me to the marrow , and I said to myself , `` There , I 've got it !
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 6]: and I shall die . ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 33]: Life on these miserable terms was not worth living , and at last I made up my mind to get the disease and have it over , one way or the other .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 25]: I escaped from the house and went to the house of a neighbor where a playmate of mine was very ill with the malady .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 16]: When the chance offered I crept into his room and got into bed with him .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 12]: I was discovered by his mother and sent back into captivity .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 14]: But I had the disease ; they could not take that from me .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 6]: I came near to dying .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 29]: The whole village was interested , and anxious , and sent for news of me every day ; and not only once a day , but several times .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 22]: Everybody believed I would die ; but on the fourteenth day a change came for the worse and they were disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 8]: This was a turning-point of my life .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 6]: -LRB- Link number one . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 18]: For when I got well my mother closed my school career and apprenticed me to a printer .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 30]: She was tired of trying to keep me out of mischief , and the adventure of the measles decided her to put me into more masterful hands than hers .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 26]: I became a printer , and began to add one link after another to the chain which was to lead me into the literary profession .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 33]: A long road , but I could not know that ; and as I did not know what its goal was , or even that it had one , I was indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 3]: Also contented .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 22]: A young printer wanders around a good deal , seeking and finding work ; and seeking again , when necessity commands .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 64]: N. B. Necessity is a CIRCUMSTANCE ; Circumstance is man 's master -- and when Circumstance commands , he must obey ; he may argue the matter -- that is his privilege , just as it is the honorable privilege of a falling body to argue with the attraction of gravitation -- but it wo n't do any good , he must OBEY .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 29]: I wandered for ten years , under the guidance and dictatorship of Circumstance , and finally arrived in a city of Iowa , where I worked several months .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 15]: Among the books that interested me in those days was one about the Amazon .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 79]: The traveler told an alluring tale of his long voyage up the great river from Para to the sources of the Madeira , through the heart of an enchanted land , a land wastefully rich in tropical wonders , a romantic land where all the birds and flowers and animals were of the museum varieties , and where the alligator and the crocodile and the monkey seemed as much at home as if they were in the Zoo .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 56]: Also , he told an astonishing tale about COCA , a vegetable product of miraculous powers , asserting that it was so nourishing and so strength-giving that the native of the mountains of the Madeira region would tramp up hill and down all day on a pinch of powdered coca and require no other sustenance .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 11]: I was fired with a longing to ascend the Amazon .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 16]: Also with a longing to open up a trade in coca with all the world .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 26]: During months I dreamed that dream , and tried to contrive ways to get to Para and spring that splendid enterprise upon an unsuspecting planet .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 5]: But all in vain .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 35]: A person may PLAN as much as he wants to , but nothing of consequence is likely to come of it until the magician CIRCUMSTANCE steps in and takes the matter off his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 8]: At last Circumstance came to my help .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 6]: It was in this way .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 31]: Circumstance , to help or hurt another man , made him lose a fifty-dollar bill in the street ; and to help or hurt me , made me find it .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 14]: I advertised the find , and left for the Amazon the same day .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 8]: This was another turning-point , another link .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 29]: Could Circumstance have ordered another dweller in that town to go to the Amazon and open up a world-trade in coca on a fifty-dollar basis and been obeyed ?
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 8]: No , I was the only one .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 20]: There were other fools there -- shoals and shoals of them -- but they were not of my kind .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 9]: I was the only one of my kind .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 18]: Circumstance is powerful , but it can not work alone ; it has to have a partner .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 11]: Its partner is man 's TEMPERAMENT -- his natural disposition .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 29]: His temperament is not his invention , it is BORN in him , and he has no authority over it , neither is he responsible for its acts .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 19]: He can not change it , nothing can change it , nothing can modify it -- except temporarily .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 7]: But it wo n't stay modified .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 19]: It is permanent , like the color of the man 's eyes and the shape of his ears .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 21]: Blue eyes are gray in certain unusual lights ; but they resume their natural color when that stress is removed .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 19]: A Circumstance that will coerce one man will have no effect upon a man of a different temperament .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 23]: If Circumstance had thrown the bank-note in Caesar 's way , his temperament would not have made him start for the Amazon .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 17]: His temperament would have compelled him to do something with the money , but not that .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 12]: It might have made him advertise the note -- and WAIT .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 5]: We ca n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 32]: Also , it might have made him go to New York and buy into the Government , with results that would leave Tweed nothing to learn when it came his turn .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 19]: Very well , Circumstance furnished the capital , and my temperament told me what to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 7]: Sometimes a temperament is an ass .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 23]: When that is the case of the owner of it is an ass , too , and is going to remain one .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 32]: Training , experience , association , can temporarily so polish him , improve him , exalt him that people will think he is a mule , but they will be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 25]: Artificially he IS a mule , for the time being , but at bottom he is an ass yet , and will remain one .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 12]: By temperament I was the kind of person that DOES things .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 7]: Does them , and reflects afterward .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 14]: So I started for the Amazon without reflecting and without asking any questions .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 8]: That was more than fifty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 15]: In all that time my temperament has not changed , by even a shade .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 46]: I have been punished many and many a time , and bitterly , for doing things and reflecting afterward , but these tortures have been of no value to me ; I still do the thing commanded by Circumstance and Temperament , and reflect afterward .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 3]: Always violently .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 17]: When I am reflecting , on these occasions , even deaf persons can hear me think .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 15]: I went by the way of Cincinnati , and down the Ohio and Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 14]: My idea was to take ship , at New Orleans , for Para .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 16]: In New Orleans I inquired , and found there was no ship leaving for Para .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 12]: Also , that there never had BEEN one leaving for Para .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 3]: I reflected .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 16]: A policeman came and asked me what I was doing , and I told him .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 24]: He made me move on , and said if he caught me reflecting in the public street again he would run me in .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 10]: After a few days I was out of money .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 15]: Then Circumstance arrived , with another turning-point of my life -- a new link .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 14]: On my way down , I had made the acquaintance of a pilot .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 13]: I begged him to teach me the river , and he consented .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 5]: I became a pilot .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 30]: By and by Circumstance came again -- introducing the Civil War , this time , in order to push me ahead another stage or two toward the literary profession .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 10]: The boats stopped running , my livelihood was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 14]: Circumstance came to the rescue with a new turning-point and a fresh link .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 27]: My brother was appointed secretary to the new Territory of Nevada , and he invited me to go with him and help him in his office .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 3]: I accepted .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 31]: In Nevada , Circumstance furnished me the silver fever and I went into the mines to make a fortune , as I supposed ; but that was not the idea .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 11]: The idea was to advance me another step toward literature .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 11]: For amusement I scribbled things for the Virginia City ENTERPRISE .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 52]: One is n't a printer ten years without setting up acres of good and bad literature , and learning -- unconsciously at first , consciously later -- to discriminate between the two , within his mental limitations ; and meantime he is unconsciously acquiring what is called a `` style . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 20]: One of my efforts attracted attention , and the ENTERPRISE sent for me and put me on its staff .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 10]: And so I became a journalist -- another link .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 25]: By and by Circumstance and the Sacramento UNION sent me to the Sandwich Islands for five or six months , to write up sugar .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 22]: I did it ; and threw in a good deal of extraneous matter that had n't anything to do with sugar .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 13]: But it was this extraneous matter that helped me to another link .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 13]: It made me notorious , and San Francisco invited me to lecture .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 4]: Which I did .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 3]: And profitably .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 32]: I had long had a desire to travel and see the world , and now Circumstance had most kindly and unexpectedly hurled me upon the platform and furnished me the means .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 10]: So I joined the `` Quaker City Excursion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 48]: When I returned to America , Circumstance was waiting on the pier -- with the LAST link -- the conspicuous , the consummating , the victorious link : I was asked to WRITE A BOOK , and I did it , and called it THE INNOCENTS ABROAD .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 12]: Thus I became at last a member of the literary guild .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 15]: That was forty-two years ago , and I have been a member ever since .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 37]: Leaving the Rubicon incident away back where it belongs , I can say with truth that the reason I am in the literary profession is because I had the measles when I was twelve years old .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 46]: III Now what interests me , as regards these details , is not the details themselves , but the fact that none of them was foreseen by me , none of them was planned by me , I was the author of none of them .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 17]: Circumstance , working in harness with my temperament , created them all and compelled them all .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 22]: I often offered help , and with the best intentions , but it was rejected -- as a rule , uncourteously .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 18]: I could never plan a thing and get it to come out the way I planned it .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 15]: It came out some other way -- some way I had not counted upon .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 39]: And so I do not admire the human being -- as an intellectual marvel -- as much as I did when I was young , and got him out of books , and did not know him personally .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 21]: When I used to read that such and such a general did a certain brilliant thing , I believed it .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 6]: Whereas it was not so .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 9]: Circumstance did it by help of his temperament .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 37]: The circumstances would have failed of effect with a general of another temperament : he might see the chance , but lose the advantage by being by nature too slow or too quick or too doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 30]: Once General Grant was asked a question about a matter which had been much debated by the public and the newspapers ; he answered the question without any hesitancy .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 12]: `` General , who planned the the march through Georgia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 5]: `` The enemy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 12]: He added that the enemy usually makes your plans for you .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 29]: He meant that the enemy by neglect or through force of circumstances leaves an opening for you , and you see your chance and take advantage of it .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 17]: Circumstances do the planning for us all , no doubt , by help of our temperaments .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 37]: I see no great difference between a man and a watch , except that the man is conscious and the watch is n't , and the man TRIES to plan things and the watch does n't .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 18]: The watch does n't wind itself and does n't regulate itself -- these things are done exteriorly .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 13]: Outside influences , outside circumstances , wind the MAN and regulate him .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 25]: Left to himself , he would n't get regulated at all , and the sort of time he would keep would not be valuable .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 31]: Some rare men are wonderful watches , with gold case , compensation balance , and all those things , and some men are only simple and sweet and humble Waterburys .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 5]: I am a Waterbury .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 9]: A Waterbury of that kind , some say .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 8]: A nation is only an individual multiplied .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 14]: It makes plans and Circumstances comes and upsets them -- or enlarges them .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 14]: Some patriots throw the tea overboard ; some other patriots destroy a Bastille .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 22]: The PLANS stop there ; then Circumstance comes in , quite unexpectedly , and turns these modest riots into a revolution .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 6]: And there was poor Columbus .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 15]: He elaborated a deep plan to find a new route to an old country .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 14]: Circumstance revised his plan for him , and he found a new WORLD .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 11]: And HE gets the credit of it to this day .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 9]: He had n't anything to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 21]: Necessarily the scene of the real turning-point of my life -LRB- and of yours -RRB- was the Garden of Eden .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 27]: It was there that the first link was forged of the chain that was ultimately to lead to the emptying of me into the literary guild .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 19]: Adam 's TEMPERAMENT was the first command the Deity ever issued to a human being on this planet .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 14]: And it was the only command Adam would NEVER be able to disobey .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 18]: It said , `` Be weak , be water , be characterless , be cheaply persuadable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 16]: The latter command , to let the fruit alone , was certain to be disobeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 21]: Not by Adam himself , but by his TEMPERAMENT -- which he did not create and had no authority over .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 24]: For the TEMPERAMENT is the man ; the thing tricked out with clothes and named Man is merely its Shadow , nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 26]: The law of the tiger 's temperament is , Thou shalt kill ; the law of the sheep 's temperament is Thou shalt not kill .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 41]: To issue later commands requiring the tiger to let the fat stranger alone , and requiring the sheep to imbue its hands in the blood of the lion is not worth while , for those commands CA N'T be obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 23]: They would invite to violations of the law of TEMPERAMENT , which is supreme , and take precedence of all other authorities .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 11]: I can not help feeling disappointed in Adam and Eve .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 7]: That is , in their temperaments .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 31]: Not in THEM , poor helpless young creatures -- afflicted with temperaments made out of butter ; which butter was commanded to get into contact with fire and BE MELTED .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 41]: What I can not help wishing is , that Adam had been postponed , and Martin Luther and Joan of Arc put in their place -- that splendid pair equipped with temperaments not made of butter , but of asbestos .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 18]: By neither sugary persuasions nor by hell fire could Satan have beguiled THEM to eat the apple .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 6]: There would have been results !
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 4]: Indeed , yes .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 26]: The apple would be intact today ; there would be no human race ; there would be no YOU ; there would be no ME .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 20]: And the old , old creation-dawn scheme of ultimately launching me into the literary guild would have been defeated .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 26]: HOW TO MAKE HISTORY DATES STICK These chapters are for children , and I shall try to make the words large enough to command respect .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 20]: In the hope that you are listening , and that you have confidence in me , I will proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 22]: Dates are difficult things to acquire ; and after they are acquired it is difficult to keep them in the head .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 6]: But they are very valuable .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 33]: They are like the cattle-pens of a ranch -- they shut in the several brands of historical cattle , each within its own fence , and keep them from getting mixed together .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 41]: Dates are hard to remember because they consist of figures ; figures are monotonously unstriking in appearance , and they do n't take hold , they form no pictures , and so they give the eye no chance to help .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 5]: Pictures are the thing .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 6]: Pictures can make dates stick .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 15]: They can make nearly anything stick -- particularly IF YOU MAKE THE PICTURES YOURSELF .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 13]: Indeed , that is the great point -- make the pictures YOURSELF .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 7]: I know about this from experience .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 32]: Thirty years ago I was delivering a memorized lecture every night , and every night I had to help myself with a page of notes to keep from getting myself mixed .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 52]: The notes consisted of beginnings of sentences , and were eleven in number , and they ran something like this : `` IN THAT REGION THE WEATHER -- '' `` AT THAT TIME IT WAS A CUSTOM -- '' `` BUT IN CALIFORNIA ONE NEVER HEARD -- '' Eleven of them .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 14]: They initialed the brief divisions of the lecture and protected me against skipping .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 52]: But they all looked about alike on the page ; they formed no picture ; I had them by heart , but I could never with certainty remember the order of their succession ; therefore I always had to keep those notes by me and look at them every little while .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 18]: Once I mislaid them ; you will not be able to imagine the terrors of that evening .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 11]: I now saw that I must invent some other protection .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 44]: So I got ten of the initial letters by heart in their proper order -- I , A , B , and so on -- and I went on the platform the next night with these marked in ink on my ten finger-nails .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 6]: But it did n't answer .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 30]: I kept track of the figures for a while ; then I lost it , and after that I was never quite sure which finger I had used last .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 28]: I could n't lick off a letter after using it , for while that would have made success certain it also would have provoked too much curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 7]: There was curiosity enough without that .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 32]: To the audience I seemed more interested in my fingernails than I was in my subject ; one or two persons asked me afterward what was the matter with my hands .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 18]: It was now that the idea of pictures occurred to me ; then my troubles passed away .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 26]: In two minutes I made six pictures with a pen , and they did the work of the eleven catch-sentences , and did it perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 27]: I threw the pictures away as soon as they were made , for I was sure I could shut my eyes and see them any time .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 35]: That was a quarter of a century ago ; the lecture vanished out of my head more than twenty years ago , but I would rewrite it from the pictures -- for they remain .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 11]: Here are three of them : -LRB- Fig. 1 -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 26]: The first one is a haystack -- below it a rattlesnake -- and it told me where to begin to talk ranch-life in Carson Valley .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 40]: The second one told me where to begin the talk about a strange and violent wind that used to burst upon Carson City from the Sierra Nevadas every afternoon at two o'clock and try to blow the town away .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 48]: The third picture , as you easily perceive , is lightning ; its duty was to remind me when it was time to begin to talk about San Francisco weather , where there IS no lightning -- nor thunder , either -- and it never failed me .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 8]: I will give you a valuable hint .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 26]: When a man is making a speech and you are to follow him do n't jot down notes to speak from , jot down PICTURES .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 63]: It is awkward and embarrassing to have to keep referring to notes ; and besides it breaks up your speech and makes it ragged and non-coherent ; but you can tear up your pictures as soon as you have made them -- they will stay fresh and strong in your memory in the order and sequence in which you scratched them down .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 26]: And many will admire to see what a good memory you are furnished with , when perhaps your memory is not any better than mine .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 22]: Sixteen years ago when my children were little creatures the governess was trying to hammer some primer histories into their heads .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 34]: Part of this fun -- if you like to call it that -- consisted in the memorizing of the accession dates of the thirty-seven personages who had ruled England from the Conqueror down .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 11]: These little people found it a bitter , hard contract .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 16]: It was all dates , and all looked alike , and they would n't stick .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 28]: Day after day of the summer vacation dribbled by , and still the kings held the fort ; the children could n't conquer any six of them .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 45]: With my lecture experience in mind I was aware that I could invent some way out of the trouble with pictures , but I hoped a way could be found which would let them romp in the open air while they learned the kings .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 16]: I found it , and they mastered all the monarchs in a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 20]: The idea was to make them SEE the reigns with their eyes ; that would be a large help .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 7]: We were at the farm then .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 27]: From the house-porch the grounds sloped gradually down to the lower fence and rose on the right to the high ground where my small work-den stood .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 11]: A carriage-road wound through the grounds and up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 60]: I staked it out with the English monarchs , beginning with the Conqueror , and you could stand on the porch and clearly see every reign and its length , from the Conquest down to Victoria , then in the forty-sixth year of her reign -- EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN YEARS OF English history under your eye at once !
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 12]: English history was an unusually live topic in America just then .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 22]: The world had suddenly realized that while it was not noticing the Queen had passed Henry VIII. , passed Henry VI .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 10]: and Elizabeth , and gaining in length every day .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 22]: Her reign had entered the list of the long ones ; everybody was interested now -- it was watching a race .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 7]: Would she pass the long Edward ?
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 7]: There was a possibility of it .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 7]: Would she pass the long Henry ?
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 6]: Doubtful , most people said .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 4]: The long George ?
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 2]: Impossible !
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 4]: Everybody said it .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 13]: But we have lived to see her leave him two years behind .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 45]: I measured off 817 feet of the roadway , a foot representing a year , and at the beginning and end of each reign I drove a three-foot white-pine stake in the turf by the roadside and wrote the name and dates on it .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 27]: Abreast the middle of the porch-front stood a great granite flower-vase overflowing with a cataract of bright-yellow flowers -- I ca n't think of their name .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 7]: The vase of William the Conqueror .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 13]: We put his name on it and his accession date , 1066 .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 87]: We started from that and measured off twenty-one feet of the road , and drove William Rufus 's state ; then thirteen feet and drove the first Henry 's stake ; then thirty-five feet and drove Stephen 's ; then nineteen feet , which brought us just past the summer-house on the left ; then we staked out thirty-five , ten , and seventeen for the second Henry and Richard and John ; turned the curve and entered upon just what was needed for Henry III .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 17]: -- a level , straight stretch of fifty-six feet of road without a crinkle in it .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 17]: And it lay exactly in front of the house , in the middle of the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 31]: There could n't have been a better place for that long reign ; you could stand on the porch and see those two wide-apart stakes almost with your eyes shut .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 2 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 20]: That is n't the shape of the road -- I have bunched it up like that to save room .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 23]: The road had some great curves in it , but their gradual sweep was such that they were no mar to history .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 31]: No , in our road one could tell at a glance who was who by the size of the vacancy between stakes -- with LOCALITY to help , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 67]: Although I am away off here in a Swedish village -LRB- 1 -RRB- and those stakes did not stand till the snow came , I can see them today as plainly as ever ; and whenever I think of an English monarch his stakes rise before me of their own accord and I notice the large or small space which he takes up on our road .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 9]: Are your kings spaced off in your mind ?
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 7]: When you think of Richard III .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 5]: and of James II .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 12]: do the durations of their reigns seem about alike to you ?
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 18]: It is n't so to me ; I always notice that there 's a foot 's difference .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 7]: When you think of Henry III .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 11]: do you see a great long stretch of straight road ?
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 28]: I do ; and just at the end where it joins on to Edward I. I always see a small pear-bush with its green fruit hanging down .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 30]: When I think of the Commonwealth I see a shady little group of these small saplings which we called the oak parlor ; when I think of George III .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 46]: I see him stretching up the hill , part of him occupied by a flight of stone steps ; and I can locate Stephen to an inch when he comes into my mind , for he just filled the stretch which went by the summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 51]: Victoria 's reign reached almost to my study door on the first little summit ; there 's sixteen feet to be added now ; I believe that that would carry it to a big pine-tree that was shattered by some lightning one summer when it was trying to hit me .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 18]: We got a good deal of fun out of the history road ; and exercise , too .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 69]: We trotted the course from the conqueror to the study , the children calling out the names , dates , and length of reigns as we passed the stakes , going a good gait along the long reigns , but slowing down when we came upon people like Mary and Edward VI. , and the short Stuart and Plantagenet , to give time to get in the statistics .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 8]: I offered prizes , too -- apples .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 26]: I threw one as far as I could send it , and the child that first shouted the reign it fell in got the apple .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 54]: The children were encouraged to stop locating things as being `` over by the arbor , '' or `` in the oak parlor , '' or `` up at the stone steps , '' and say instead that the things were in Stephen , or in the Commonwealth , or in George III .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 7]: They got the habit without trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 80]: To have the long road mapped out with such exactness was a great boon for me , for I had the habit of leaving books and other articles lying around everywhere , and had not previously been able to definitely name the place , and so had often been obliged to go to fetch them myself , to save time and failure ; but now I could name the reign I left them in , and send the children .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 38]: Next I thought I would measure off the French reigns , and peg them alongside the English ones , so that we could always have contemporaneous French history under our eyes as we went our English rounds .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 24]: We pegged them down to the Hundred Years ' War , then threw the idea aside , I do not now remember why .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 24]: After that we made the English pegs fence in European and American history as well as English , and that answered very well .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 32]: English and alien poets , statesmen , artists , heroes , battles , plagues , cataclysms , revolutions -- we shoveled them all into the English fences according to their dates .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 4]: Do you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 9]: We gave Washington 's birth to George II .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 9]: 's pegs and his death to George III .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 5]: 's ; George II .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 8]: got the Lisbon earthquake and George III .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 5]: the Declaration of Independence .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 83]: Goethe , Shakespeare , Napoleon , Savonarola , Joan of Arc , the French Revolution , the Edict of Nantes , Clive , Wellington , Waterloo , Plassey , Patay , Cowpens , Saratoga , the Battle of the Boyne , the invention of the logarithms , the microscope , the steam-engine , the telegraph -- anything and everything all over the world -- we dumped it all in among the English pegs according to it date and regardless of its nationality .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 31]: If the road-pegging scheme had not succeeded I should have lodged the kings in the children 's heads by means of pictures -- that is , I should have tried .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 53]: It might have failed , for the pictures could only be effective WHEN MADE BY THE PUPIL ; not the master , for it is the work put upon the drawing that makes the drawing stay in the memory , and my children were too little to make drawings at that time .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 24]: And , besides , they had no talent for art , which is strange , for in other ways they are like me .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 19]: But I will develop the picture plan now , hoping that you will be able to use it .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 22]: It will come good for indoors when the weather is bad and one can not go outside and peg a road .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 35]: Let us imagine that the kings are a procession , and that they have come out of the Ark and down Ararat for exercise and are now starting back again up the zigzag road .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 24]: This will bring several of them into view at once , and each zigzag will represent the length of a king 's reign .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 4]: And so on .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 18]: You will have plenty of space , for by my project you will use the parlor wall .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 13]: You do not mark on the wall ; that would cause trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 13]: You only attach bits of paper to it with pins or thumb-tacks .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 6]: These will leave no mark .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 30]: Take your pen now , and twenty-one pieces of white paper , each two inches square , and we will do the twenty-one years of the Conqueror 's reign .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 18]: On each square draw a picture of a whale and write the dates and term of service .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 56]: We choose the whale for several reasons : its name and William 's begin with the same letter ; it is the biggest fish that swims , and William is the most conspicuous figure in English history in the way of a landmark ; finally , a whale is about the easiest thing to draw .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 42]: By the time you have drawn twenty-one wales and written `` William I. -- 1066-1087 -- twenty-one years '' twenty-one times , those details will be your property ; you can not dislodge them from your memory with anything but dynamite .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 15]: I will make a sample for you to copy : -LRB- Fig. 3 -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 21]: I have got his chin up too high , but that is no matter ; he is looking for Harold .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 41]: It may be that a whale has n't that fin up there on his back , but I do not remember ; and so , since there is a doubt , it is best to err on the safe side .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 12]: He looks better , anyway , than he would without it .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 37]: Be very careful and ATTENTIVE while you are drawing your first whale from my sample and writing the word and figures under it , so that you will not need to copy the sample any more .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 75]: Compare your copy with the sample ; examine closely ; if you find you have got everything right and can shut your eyes and see the picture and call the words and figures , then turn the sample and copy upside down and make the next copy from memory ; and also the next and next , and so on , always drawing and writing from memory until you have finished the whole twenty-one .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 62]: This will take you twenty minutes , or thirty , and by that time you will find that you can make a whale in less time than an unpracticed person can make a sardine ; also , up to the time you die you will always be able to furnish William 's dates to any ignorant person that inquires after them .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 20]: You will now take thirteen pieces of BLUE paper , each two inches square , and do William II .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 4 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 31]: Make him spout his water forward instead of backward ; also make him small , and stick a harpoon in him and give him that sick look in the eye .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 20]: Otherwise you might seem to be continuing the other William , and that would be confusing and a damage .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 36]: It is quite right to make him small ; he was only about a No. 11 whale , or along there somewhere ; there was n't room in him for his father 's great spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 52]: The barb of that harpoon ought not to show like that , because it is down inside the whale and ought to be out of sight , but it can not be helped ; if the barb were removed people would think some one had stuck a whip-stock into the whale .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 26]: It is best to leave the barb the way it is , then every one will know it is a harpoon and attending to business .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 19]: Remember -- draw from the copy only once ; make your other twelve and the inscription from memory .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 37]: Now the truth is that whenever you have copied a picture and its inscription once from my sample and two or three times from memory the details will stay with you and be hard to forget .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 45]: After that , if you like , you may make merely the whale 's HEAD and WATER-SPOUT for the Conqueror till you end his reign , each time SAYING the inscription in place of writing it ; and in the case of William II .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 16]: make the HARPOON alone , and say over the inscription each time you do it .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 41]: You see , it will take nearly twice as long to do the first set as it will to do the second , and that will give you a marked sense of the difference in length of the two reigns .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 11]: Next do Henry I. on thirty-five squares of RED paper .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 5 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 14]: That is a hen , and suggests Henry by furnishing the first syllable .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 37]: When you have repeated the hen and the inscription until you are perfectly sure of them , draw merely the hen 's head the rest of the thirty-five times , saying over the inscription each time .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 7]: Thus : -LRB- Fig. 6 -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 19]: You begin to understand how how this procession is going to look when it is on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 39]: First there will be the Conqueror 's twenty-one whales and water-spouts , the twenty-one white squares joined to one another and making a white stripe three and one-half feet long ; the thirteen blue squares of William II .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 33]: will be joined to that -- a blue stripe two feet , two inches long , followed by Henry 's red stripe five feet , ten inches long , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 28]: The colored divisions will smartly show to the eye the difference in the length of the reigns and impress the proportions on the memory and the understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 7 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 6]: Stephen of Blois comes next .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 9]: He requires nineteen two-inch squares of YELLOW paper .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 8 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 5]: That is a steer .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 10]: The sound suggests the beginning of Stephen 's name .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 7]: I choose it for that reason .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 14]: I can make a better steer than that when I am not excited .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 6]: But this one will do .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 8]: It is a good-enough steer for history .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 12]: The tail is defective , but it only wants straightening out .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 5]: Next comes Henry II .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 8]: Give him thirty-five squares of RED paper .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 11]: These hens must face west , like the former ones .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 9 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 8]: This hen differs from the other one .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 14]: He is on his way to inquire what has been happening in Canterbury .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 38]: How we arrive at Richard I. , called Richard of the Lion-heart because he was a brave fighter and was never so contented as when he was leading crusades in Palestine and neglecting his affairs at home .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 8]: Give him ten squares of WHITE paper .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 10 -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 5]: That is a lion .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 11]: His office is to remind you of the lion-hearted Richard .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 25]: There is something the matter with his legs , but I do not quite know what it is , they do not seem right .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 29]: I think the hind ones are the most unsatisfactory ; the front ones are well enough , though it would be better if they were rights and lefts .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 12]: Next comes King John , and he was a poor circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 5]: He was called Lackland .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 8]: He gave his realm to the Pope .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 9]: Let him have seventeen squares of YELLOW paper .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 11 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 6]: That creature is a jamboree .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 16]: It looks like a trademark , but that is only an accident and not intentional .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 6]: It is prehistoric and extinct .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 40]: It used to roam the earth in the Old Silurian times , and lay eggs and catch fish and climb trees and live on fossils ; for it was of a mixed breed , which was the fashion then .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 21]: It was very fierce , and the Old Silurians were afraid of it , but this is a tame one .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 14]: Physically it has no representative now , but its mind has been transmitted .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 32]: First I drew it sitting down , but have turned it the other way now because I think it looks more attractive and spirited when one end of it is galloping .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 56]: I love to think that in this attitude it gives us a pleasant idea of John coming all in a happy excitement to see what the barons have been arranging for him at Runnymede , while the other one gives us an idea of him sitting down to wring his hands and grieve over it .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 18]: We now come to Henry III. ; RED squares again , of course -- fifty-six of them .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 23]: We must make all the Henrys the same color ; it will make their long reigns show up handsomely on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 12]: Among all the eight Henrys there were but two short ones .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 10]: A lucky name , as far as longevity goes .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 11]: The reigns of six of the Henrys cover 227 years .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 23]: It might have been well to name all the royal princes Henry , but this was overlooked until it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 12 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 7]: This is the best one yet .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 22]: He is on his way -LRB- 1265 -RRB- to have a look at the first House of Commons in English history .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 26]: It was a monumental event , the situation in the House , and was the second great liberty landmark which the century had set up .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 13]: I have made Henry looking glad , but this was not intentional .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 11]: Edward I. comes next ; LIGHT-BROWN paper , thirty-five squares .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 13 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 5]: That is an editor .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 9]: He is trying to think of a word .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 21]: He props his feet on a chair , which is the editor 's way ; then he can think better .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 29]: I do not care much for this one ; his ears are not alike ; still , editor suggests the sound of Edward , and he will do .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 19]: I could make him better if I had a model , but I made this one from memory .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 13]: But is no particular matter ; they all look alike , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 12]: They are conceited and troublesome , and do n't pay enough .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 14]: Edward was the first really English king that had yet occupied the throne .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 24]: The editor in the picture probably looks just as Edward looked when it was first borne in upon him that this was so .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 13]: His whole attitude expressed gratification and pride mixed with stupefaction and astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 3]: Edward II .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 6]: now ; twenty BLUE squares .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 14 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 3]: Another editor .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 9]: That thing behind his ear is his pencil .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 16]: Whenever he finds a bright thing in your manuscript he strikes it out with that .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 23]: That does him good , and makes him smile and show his teeth , the way he is doing in the picture .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 26]: This one has just been striking out a smart thing , and now he is sitting there with his thumbs in his vest-holes , gloating .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 11]: They are full of envy and malice , editors are .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 11]: This picture will serve to remind you that Edward II .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 9]: was the first English king who was DEPOSED .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 9]: Upon demand , he signed his deposition himself .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 27]: He had found kingship a most aggravating and disagreeable occupation , and you can see by the look of him that he is glad he resigned .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 11]: He has put his blue pencil up for good now .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 14]: He had struck out many a good thing with it in his time .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 3]: Edward III .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 6]: next ; fifty RED squares .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 15 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 6]: This editor is a critic .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 24]: He has pulled out his carving-knife and his tomahawk and is starting after a book which he is going to have for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 9]: This one 's arms are put on wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 14]: I did not notice it at first , but I see it now .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 34]: Somehow he has got his right arm on his left shoulder , and his left arm on his right shoulder , and this shows us the back of his hands in both instances .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 23]: It makes him left-handed all around , which is a thing which has never happened before , except perhaps in a museum .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 59]: That is the way with art , when it is not acquired but born to you : you start in to make some simple little thing , not suspecting that your genius is beginning to work and swell and strain in secret , and all of a sudden there is a convulsion and you fetch out something astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 5]: This is called inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 13]: It is an accident ; you never know when it is coming .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 68]: I might have tried as much as a year to think of such a strange thing as an all-around left-handed man and I could not have done it , for the more you try to think of an unthinkable thing the more it eludes you ; but it ca n't elude inspiration ; you have only to bait with inspiration and you will get it every time .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 8]: Look at Botticelli 's `` Spring . ''
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 17]: Those snaky women were unthinkable , but inspiration secured them for us , thanks to goodness .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 18]: It is too late to reorganize this editor-critic now ; we will leave him as he is .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 7]: He will serve to remind us .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 3]: Richard II .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 6]: next ; twenty-two WHITE squares .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 16 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 11]: We use the lion again because this is another Richard .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 8]: Like Edward II. , he was DEPOSED .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 16]: He is taking a last sad look at his crown before they take it away .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 21]: There was not room enough and I have made it too small ; but it never fitted him , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 19]: Now we turn the corner of the century with a new line of monarchs -- the Lancastrian kings .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 9]: Henry IV. ; fourteen squares of YELLOW paper .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 17 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 18]: This hen has laid the egg of a new dynasty and realizes the magnitude of the event .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 9]: She is giving notice in the usual way .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 11]: You notice I am improving in the construction of hens .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 17]: At first I made them too much like other animals , but this one is orthodox .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 7]: I mention this to encourage you .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 15]: You will find that the more you practice the more accurate you will become .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 30]: I could always draw animals , but before I was educated I could not tell what kind they were when I got them done , but now I can .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 20]: Keep up your courage ; it will be the same with you , although you may not think it .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 12]: This Henry died the year after Joan of Arc was born .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 7]: Henry V. ; nine BLUE squares .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 25]: -LRB- Fig. 18 -RRB- There you see him lost in meditation over the monument which records the amazing figures of the battle of Agincourt .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 27]: French history says 20,000 Englishmen routed 80,000 Frenchmen there ; and English historians say that the French loss , in killed and wounded , was 60,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 7]: Henry VI. ; thirty-nine RED squares .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 20]: -LRB- Fig. 19 -RRB- This is poor Henry VI. , who reigned long and scored many misfortunes and humiliations .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 25]: Also two great disasters : he lost France to Joan of Arc and he lost the throne and ended the dynasty which Henry IV .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 9]: had started in business with such good prospects .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 21]: In the picture we see him sad and weary and downcast , with the scepter falling from his nerveless grasp .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 15]: It is a pathetic quenching of a sun which had risen in such splendor .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 7]: Edward IV. ; twenty-two LIGHT-BROWN squares .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 20 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 53]: That is a society editor , sitting there elegantly dressed , with his legs crossed in that indolent way , observing the clothes the ladies wear , so that he can describe them for his paper and make them out finer than they are and get bribes for it and become wealthy .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 54]: That flower which he is wearing in his buttonhole is a rose -- a white rose , a York rose -- and will serve to remind us of the War of the Roses , and that the white one was the winning color when Edward got the throne and dispossessed the Lancastrian dynasty .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 9]: Edward V. ; one-third of a BLACK square .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 21 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 10]: His uncle Richard had him murdered in the tower .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 18]: When you get the reigns displayed upon the wall this one will be conspicuous and easily remembered .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 20]: It is the shortest one in English history except Lady Jane Grey 's , which was only nine days .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 56]: She is never officially recognized as a monarch of England , but if you or I should ever occupy a throne we should like to have proper notice taken of it ; and it would be only fair and right , too , particularly if we gained nothing by it and lost our lives besides .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 7]: Richard III. ; two WHITE squares .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 22 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 17]: That is not a very good lion , but Richard was not a very good king .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 22]: You would think that this lion has two heads , but that is not so ; one is only a shadow .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 34]: There would be shadows for the rest of him , but there was not light enough to go round , it being a dull day , with only fleeting sun-glimpses now and then .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 18]: Richard had a humped back and a hard heart , and fell at the battle of Bosworth .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 64]: I do not know the name of that flower in the pot , but we will use it as Richard 's trade-mark , for it is said that it grows in only one place in the world -- Bosworth Field -- and tradition says it never grew there until Richard 's royal blood warmed its hidden seed to life and made it grow .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 7]: Henry VII. ; twenty-four BLUE squares .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 23 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 3]: Henry VII .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 22]: had no liking for wars and turbulence ; he preferred peace and quiet and the general prosperity which such conditions create .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 31]: He liked to sit on that kind of eggs on his own private account as well as the nation 's , and hatch them out and count up their result .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 25]: When he died he left his heir 2,000,000 pounds , which was a most unusual fortune for a king to possess in those days .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 27]: Columbus 's great achievement gave him the discovery-fever , and he sent Sebastian Cabot to the New World to search out some foreign territory for England .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 11]: That is Cabot 's ship up there in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 20]: This was the first time that England went far abroad to enlarge her estate -- but not the last .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 7]: Henry VIII. ; thirty-eight RED squares .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 24 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 5]: That is Henry VIII .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 8]: suppressing a monastery in his arrogant fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 9]: Edward VI. ; six squares of YELLOW paper .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 25 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 8]: He is the last Edward to date .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 19]: It is indicated by that thing over his head , which is a LAST -- shoemaker 's last .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 8]: Mary ; five squares of BLACK paper .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 5]: -LRB- Fig. 26 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 7]: The picture represents a burning martyr .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 8]: He is in back of the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 20]: The first three letters of Mary 's name and the first three of the word martyr are the same .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 18]: Martyrdom was going out in her day and martyrs were becoming scarcer , but she made several .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 10]: For this reason she is sometimes called Bloody Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 29]: This brings us to the reign of Elizabeth , after passing through a period of nearly five hundred years of England 's history -- 492 to be exact .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 27]: I think you may now be trusted to go the rest of the way without further lessons in art or inspirations in the matter of ideas .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 21]: You have the scheme now , and something in the ruler 's name or career will suggest the pictorial symbol .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 20]: The effort of inventing such things will not only help your memory , but will develop originality in art .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 8]: See what it has done for me .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 27]: If you do not find the parlor wall big enough for all of England 's history , continue it into the dining-room and into other rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 24]: This will make the walls interesting and instructive and really worth something instead of being just flat things to hold the house together .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 4]: Summer of 1899 .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 5]: THE MEMORABLE ASSASSINATION Note .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 24]: -- The assassination of the Empress of Austria at Geneva , September 10 , 1898 , occurred during Mark Twain 's Austrian residence .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 18]: The news came to him at Kaltenleutgeben , a summer resort a little way out of Vienna .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 40]: To his friend , the Rev. Jos. H. Twichell , he wrote : `` That good and unoffending lady , the Empress , is killed by a madman , and I am living in the midst of world-history again .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 39]: The Queen 's Jubilee last year , the invasion of the Reichsrath by the police , and now this murder , which will still be talked of and described and painted a thousand a thousand years from now .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 37]: To have a personal friend of the wearer of two crowns burst in at the gate in the deep dusk of the evening and say , in a voice broken with tears , ` My God !
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 68]: the Empress is murdered , ' and fly toward her home before we can utter a question -- why , it brings the giant event home to you , makes you a part of it and personally interested ; it is as if your neighbor , Antony , should come flying and say , ` Caesar is butchered -- the head of the world is fallen ! '
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 11]: `` Of course there is no talk but of this .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 12]: The mourning is universal and genuine , the consternation is stupefying .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 9]: The Austrian Empire is being draped with black .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 18]: Vienna will be a spectacle to see by next Saturday , when the funeral cortege marches . ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 14]: He was strongly moved by the tragedy , impelled to write concerning it .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 34]: He prepared the article which follows , but did not offer it for publication , perhaps feeling that his own close association with the court circles at the moment prohibited this personal utterance .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 11]: There appears no such reason for withholding its publication now .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 4]: A. B. P .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 17]: The more one thinks of the assassination , the more imposing and tremendous the event becomes .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 67]: The destruction of a city is a large event , but it is one which repeats itself several times in a thousand years ; the destruction of a third part of a nation by plague and famine is a large event , but it has happened several times in history ; the murder of a king is a large event , but it has been frequent .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 12]: The murder of an empress is the largest of all events .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 18]: One must go back about two thousand years to find an instance to put with this one .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 40]: The oldest family of unchallenged descent in Christendom lives in Rome and traces its line back seventeen hundred years , but no member of it has been present in the earth when an empress was murdered , until now .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 111]: Many a time during these seventeen centuries members of that family have been startled with the news of extraordinary events -- the destruction of cities , the fall of thrones , the murder of kings , the wreck of dynasties , the extinction of religions , the birth of new systems of government ; and their descendants have been by to hear of it and talk about it when all these things were repeated once , twice , or a dozen times -- but to even that family has come news at last which is not staled by use , has no duplicates in the long reach of its memory .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 69]: It is an event which confers a curious distinction upon every individual now living in the world : he has stood alive and breathing in the presence of an event such as has not fallen within the experience of any traceable or untraceable ancestor of his for twenty centuries , and it is not likely to fall within the experience of any descendant of his for twenty more .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 11]: Time has made some great changes since the Roman days .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 26]: The murder of an empress then -- even the assassination of Caesar himself -- could not electrify the world as this murder has electrified it .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 83]: For one reason , there was then not much of a world to electrify ; it was a small world , as to known bulk , and it had rather a thin population , besides ; and for another reason , the news traveled so slowly that its tremendous initial thrill wasted away , week by week and month by month , on the journey , and by the time it reached the remoter regions there was but little of it left .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 27]: It was no longer a fresh event , it was a thing of the far past ; it was not properly news , it was history .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 32]: But the world is enormous now , and prodigiously populated -- that is one change ; and another is the lightning swiftness of the flight of tidings , good and bad .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 7]: `` The Empress is murdered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 74]: When those amazing words struck upon my ear in this Austrian village last Saturday , three hours after the disaster , I knew that it was already old news in London , Paris , Berlin , New York , San Francisco , Japan , China , Melbourne , Cape Town , Bombay , Madras , Calcutta , and that the entire globe with a single voice , was cursing the perpetrator of it .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 70]: Since the telegraph first began to stretch itself wider and wider about the earth , larger and increasingly larger areas of the world have , as time went on , received simultaneously the shock of a great calamity ; but this is the first time in history that the entire surface of the globe has been swept in a single instant with the thrill of so gigantic an event .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 14]: And who is the miracle-worker who has furnished to the world this spectacle ?
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 9]: All the ironies are compacted in the answer .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 117]: He is at the bottom of the human ladder , as the accepted estimates of degree and value go : a soiled and patched young loafer , without gifts , without talents , without education , without morals , without character , without any born charm or any acquired one that wins or beguiles or attracts ; without a single grace of mind or heart or hand that any tramp or prostitute could envy him ; an unfaithful private in the ranks , an incompetent stone-cutter , an inefficient lackey ; in a word , a mangy , offensive , empty , unwashed , vulgar , gross , mephitic , timid , sneaking , human polecat .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 47]: And it was within the privileges and powers of this sarcasm upon the human race to reach up -- up -- up -- and strike from its far summit in the social skies the world 's accepted ideal of Glory and Might and Splendor and Sacredness !
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 12]: It realizes to us what sorry shows and shadows we are .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 27]: Without our clothes and our pedestals we are poor things and much of a size ; our dignities are not real , our pomps are shams .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 32]: At our best and stateliest we are not suns , as we pretended , and teach , and believe , but only candles ; and any bummer can blow us out .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 40]: And now we get realized to us once more another thing which we often forget -- or try to : that no man has a wholly undiseased mind ; that in one way or another all men are mad .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 6]: Many are mad for money .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 65]: When this madness is in a mild form it is harmless and the man passes for sane ; but when it develops powerfully and takes possession of the man , it can make him cheat , rob , and kill ; and when he has got his fortune and lost it again it can land him in the asylum or the suicide 's coffin .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 46]: Love is a madness ; if thwarted it develops fast ; it can grow to a frenzy of despair and make an otherwise sane and highly gifted prince , like Rudolph , throw away the crown of an empire and snuff out his own life .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 42]: All the whole list of desires , predilections , aversions , ambitions , passions , cares , griefs , regrets , remorses , are incipient madness , and ready to grow , spread , and consume , when the occasion comes .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 27]: There are no healthy minds , and nothing saves any man but accident -- the accident of not having his malady put to the supreme test .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 21]: One of the commonest forms of madness is the desire to be noticed , the pleasure derived from being noticed .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 10]: Perhaps it is not merely common , but universal .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 9]: In its mildest form it doubtless is universal .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 69]: Every child is pleased at being noticed ; many intolerable children put in their whole time in distressing and idiotic effort to attract the attention of visitors ; boys are always `` showing off '' ; apparently all men and women are glad and grateful when they find that they have done a thing which has lifted them for a moment out of obscurity and caused wondering talk .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 22]: This common madness can develop , by nurture , into a hunger for notoriety in one , for fame in another .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 95]: It is this madness for being noticed and talked about which has invented kingship and the thousand other dignities , and tricked them out with pretty and showy fineries ; it has made kings pick one another 's pockets , scramble for one another 's crowns and estates , slaughter one another 's subjects ; it has raised up prize-fighters , and poets , and villages mayors , and little and big politicians , and big and little charity-founders , and bicycle champions , and banditti chiefs , and frontier desperadoes , and Napoleons .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 45]: Anything to get notoriety ; anything to set the village , or the township , or the city , or the State , or the nation , or the planet shouting , `` Look -- there he goes -- that is the man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 81]: And in five minutes ' time , at no cost of brain , or labor , or genius this mangy Italian tramp has beaten them all , transcended them all , outstripped them all , for in time their names will perish ; but by the friendly help of the insane newspapers and courts and kings and historians , his is safe and live and thunder in the world all down the ages as long as human speech shall endure !
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 14]: Oh , if it were not so tragic how ludicrous it would be !
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 68]: She was so blameless , the Empress ; and so beautiful , in mind and heart , in person and spirit ; and whether with a crown upon her head or without it and nameless , a grace to the human race , and almost a justification of its creation ; WOULD be , indeed , but that the animal that struck her down re-establishes the doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 21]: In her character was every quality that in woman invites and engages respect , esteem , affection , and homage .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 31]: Her tastes , her instincts , and her aspirations were all high and fine and all her life her heart and brain were busy with activities of a noble sort .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 35]: She had had bitter griefs , but they did not sour her spirit , and she had had the highest honors in the world 's gift , but she went her simple way unspoiled .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 16]: She knew all ranks , and won them all , and made them her friends .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 27]: An English fisherman 's wife said , `` When a body was in trouble she did n't send her help , she brought it herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 11]: Crowns have adorned others , but she adorned her crowns .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 9]: It was a swift celebrity the assassin achieved .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 9]: And it is marked by some curious contrasts .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 81]: At noon last , Saturday there was no one in the world who would have considered acquaintanceship with him a thing worth claiming or mentioning ; no one would have been vain of such an acquaintanceship ; the humblest honest boot-black would not have valued the fact that he had met him or seen him at some time or other ; he was sunk in abysmal obscurity , he was away beneath the notice of the bottom grades of officialdom .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 43]: Three hours later he was the one subject of conversation in the world , the gilded generals and admirals and governors were discussing him , all the kings and queens and emperors had put aside their other interests to talk about him .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 53]: And wherever there was a man , at the summit of the world or the bottom of it , who by chance had at some time or other come across that creature , he remembered it with a secret satisfaction , and MENTIONED it -- for it was a distinction , now !
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 24]: It brings human dignity pretty low , and for a moment the thing is not quite realizable -- but it is perfectly true .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 49]: If there is a king who can remember , now , that he once saw that creature in a time past , he has let that fact out , in a more or less studiedly casual and indifferent way , some dozens of times during the past week .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 41]: For a king is merely human ; the inside of him is exactly like the inside of any other person ; and it is human to find satisfaction in being in a kind of personal way connected with amazing events .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 57]: We are all privately vain of such a thing ; we are all alike ; a king is a king by accident ; the reason the rest of us are not kings is merely due to another accident ; we are all made out of the same clay , and it is a sufficient poor quality .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 35]: Below the kings , these remarks are in the air these days ; I know it well as if I were hearing them : THE COMMANDER : `` He was in my army . ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 11]: THE GENERAL : `` He was in my corps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 10]: THE COLONEL : `` He was in my regiment .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 3]: A brute .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 6]: I remember him well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 10]: THE CAPTAIN : `` He was in my company .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 4]: A troublesome scoundrel .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 6]: I remember him well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 9]: THE SERGEANT : `` Did I know him ?
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 7]: As well as I know you .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 24]: Why , every morning I used to -- '' etc. , etc. ; a glad , long story , told to devouring ears .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 13]: THE LANDLADY : `` Many 's the time he boarded with me .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 16]: I can show you his very room , and the very bed he slept in .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 13]: And the charcoal mark there on the wall -- he made that .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 12]: My little Johnny saw him do it with his own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 7]: Did n't you , Johnny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 43]: It is easy to see , by the papers , that the magistrate and the constables and the jailer treasure up the assassin 's daily remarks and doings as precious things , and as wallowing this week in seas of blissful distinction .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 56]: The interviewer , too ; he tried to let on that he is not vain of his privilege of contact with this man whom few others are allowed to gaze upon , but he is human , like the rest , and can no more keep his vanity corked in than could you or I .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 24]: Some think that this murder is a frenzied revolt against the criminal militarism which is impoverishing Europe and driving the starving poor mad .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 16]: That has many crimes to answer for , but not this one , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 30]: One may not attribute to this man a generous indignation against the wrongs done the poor ; one may not dignify him with a generous impulse of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 24]: When he saw his photograph and said , `` I shall be celebrated , '' he laid bare the impulse that prompted him .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 8]: It was a mere hunger for notoriety .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 23]: There is another confessed case of the kind which is as old as history -- the burning of the temple of Ephesus .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 40]: Among the inadequate attempts to account for the assassination we must concede high rank to the many which have described it as a `` peculiarly brutal crime '' and then added that it was `` ordained from above . ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 12]: I think this verdict will not be popular `` above . ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 37]: If the deed was ordained from above , there is no rational way of making this prisoner even partially responsible for it , and the Genevan court can not condemn him without manifestly committing a crime .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 37]: Logic is logic , and by disregarding its laws even the most pious and showy theologian may be beguiled into preferring charges which should not be ventured upon except in the shelter of plenty of lightning-rods .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 24]: I witnessed the funeral procession , in company with friends , from the windows of the Krantz , Vienna 's sumptuous new hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 20]: We came into town in the middle of the forenoon , and I went on foot from the station .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 138]: Black flags hung down from all the houses ; the aspects were Sunday-like ; the crowds on the sidewalks were quiet and moved slowly ; very few people were smoking ; many ladies wore deep mourning , gentlemen were in black as a rule ; carriages were speeding in all directions , with footmen and coachmen in black clothes and wearing black cocked hats ; the shops were closed ; in many windows were pictures of the Empress : as a beautiful young bride of seventeen ; as a serene and majestic lady with added years ; and finally in deep black and without ornaments -- the costume she always wore after the tragic death of her son nine years ago , for her heart broke then , and life lost almost all its value for her .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 26]: The people stood grouped before these pictures , and now and then one saw women and girls turn away wiping the tears from their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 24]: In front of the Krantz is an open square ; over the way was the church where the funeral services would be held .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 41]: It is small and old and severely plain , plastered outside and whitewashed or painted , and with no ornament but a statue of a monk in a niche over the door , and above that a small black flag .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 30]: But in its crypt lie several of the great dead of the House of Habsburg , among them Maria Theresa and Napoleon 's son , the Duke of Reichstadt .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 36]: Hereabouts was a Roman camp , once , and in it the Emperor Marcus Aurelius died a thousand years before the first Habsburg ruled in Vienna , which was six hundred years ago and more .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 23]: The little church is packed in among great modern stores and houses , and the windows of them were full of people .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 34]: Behind the vast plate-glass windows of the upper floors of the house on the corner one glimpsed terraced masses of fine-clothed men and women , dim and shimmery , like people under water .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 79]: Under us the square was noiseless , but it was full of citizens ; officials in fine uniforms were flitting about on errands , and in a doorstep sat a figure in the uttermost raggedness of poverty , the feet bare , the head bent humbly down ; a youth of eighteen or twenty , he was , and through the field-glass one could see that he was tearing apart and munching riffraff that he had gathered somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 45]: Blazing uniforms flashed by him , making a sparkling contrast with his drooping ruin of moldy rags , but he took not notice ; he was not there to grieve for a nation 's disaster ; he had his own cares , and deeper .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 44]: From two directions two long files of infantry came plowing through the pack and press in silence ; there was a low , crisp order and the crowd vanished , the square save the sidewalks was empty , the private mourner was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 17]: Another order , the soldiers fell apart and enclosed the square in a double-ranked human fence .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 16]: It was all so swift , noiseless , exact -- like a beautifully ordered machine .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 6]: It was noon , now .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 8]: Two hours of stillness and waiting followed .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 24]: Then carriages began to flow past and deliver the two and three hundred court personages and high nobilities privileged to enter the church .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 22]: Then the square filled up ; not with civilians , but with army and navy officers in showy and beautiful uniforms .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 25]: They filled it compactly , leaving only a narrow carriage path in front of the church , but there was no civilian among them .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 15]: And it was better so ; dull clothes would have marred the radiant spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 79]: In the jam in front of the church , on its steps , and on the sidewalk was a bunch of uniforms which made a blazing splotch of color -- intense red , gold , and white -- which dimmed the brilliancies around them ; and opposite them on the other side of the path was a bunch of cascaded bright-green plumes above pale-blue shoulders which made another splotch of splendor emphatic and conspicuous in its glowing surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 19]: It was a sea of flashing color all about , but these two groups were the high notes .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 28]: The green plumes were worn by forty or fifty Austrian generals , the group opposite them were chiefly Knights of Malta and knights of a German order .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 67]: The mass of heads in the square were covered by gilt helmets and by military caps roofed with a mirror-like gaze , and the movements of the wearers caused these things to catch the sun-rays , and the effect was fine to see -- the square was like a garden of richly colored flowers with a multitude of blinding and flashing little suns distributed over it .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 49]: Think of it -- it was by command of that Italian loafer yonder on his imperial throne in the Geneva prison that this splendid multitude was assembled there ; and the kings and emperors that were entering the church from a side street were there by his will .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 8]: It is so strange , so unrealizable .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 13]: At three o'clock the carriages were still streaming by in single file .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 29]: At three-five a cardinal arrives with his attendants ; later some bishops ; then a number of archdeacons -- all in striking colors that add to the show .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 12]: At three-ten a procession of priests passed along , with crucifix .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 45]: Another one , presently ; after an interval , two more ; at three-fifty another one -- very long , with many crosses , gold-embroidered robes , and much white lace ; also great pictured banners , at intervals , receding into the distance .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 13]: A hum of tolling bells makes itself heard , but not sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 6]: At three-fifty-eight a waiting interval .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 54]: Presently a long procession of gentlemen in evening dress comes in sight and approaches until it is near to the square , then falls back against the wall of soldiers at the sidewalk , and the white shirt-fronts show like snowflakes and are very conspicuous where so much warm color is all about .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 4]: A waiting pause .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 14]: At four-twelve the head of the funeral procession comes into view at last .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 15]: First , a body of cavalry , four abreast , to widen the path .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 15]: Next , a great body of lancers , in blue , with gilt helmets .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 19]: Next , three six-horse mourning-coaches ; outriders and coachmen in black , with cocked hats and white wigs .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 17]: Next , troops in splendid uniforms , red , gold , and white , exceedingly showy .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 5]: Now the multitude uncover .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 49]: The soldiers present arms ; there is a low rumble of drums ; the sumptuous great hearse approaches , drawn at a walk by eight black horses plumed with black bunches of nodding ostrich feathers ; the coffin is borne into the church , the doors are closed .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 50]: The multitude cover their heads , and the rest of the procession moves by ; first the Hungarian Guard in their indescribably brilliant and picturesque and beautiful uniform , inherited from the ages of barbaric splendor , and after them other mounted forces , a long and showy array .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 47]: Then the shining crown in the square crumbled apart , a wrecked rainbow , and melted away in radiant streams , and in the turn of a wrist the three dirtiest and raggedest and cheerfulest little slum-girls in Austria were capering about in the spacious vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 7]: It was a day of contrasts .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 8]: Twice the Empress entered Vienna in state .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 149]: The first time was in 1854 , when she was a bride of seventeen , and then she rode in measureless pomp and with blare of music through a fluttering world of gay flags and decorations , down streets walled on both hands with a press of shouting and welcoming subjects ; and the second time was last Wednesday , when she entered the city in her coffin and moved down the same streets in the dead of the night under swaying black flags , between packed human walls again ; but everywhere was a deep stillness , now -- a stillness emphasized , rather than broken , by the muffled hoofbeats of the long cavalcade over pavements cushioned with sand , and the low sobbing of gray-headed women who had witnessed the first entry forty-four years before , when she and they were young -- and unaware !
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 135]: A character in Baron von Berger 's recent fairy drama `` Habsburg '' tells about the first coming of the girlish Empress-Queen , and in his history draws a fine picture : I can not make a close translation of it , but will try to convey the spirit of the verses : I saw the stately pageant pass : In her high place I saw the Empress-Queen : I could not take my eyes away From that fair vision , spirit-like and pure , That rose serene , sublime , and figured to my sense A noble Alp far lighted in the blue , That in the flood of morning rends its veil of cloud And stands a dream of glory to the gaze Of them that in the Valley toil and plod .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 26]: A SCRAP OF CURIOUS HISTORY Marion City , on the Mississippi River , in the State of Missouri -- a village ; time , 1845 .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 17]: La Bourboule-les-Bains , France -- a village ; time , the end of June , 1894 .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 18]: I was in the one village in that early time ; I am in the other now .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 38]: These times and places are sufficiently wide apart , yet today I have the strange sense of being thrust back into that Missourian village and of reliving certain stirring days that I lived there so long ago .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 19]: Last Saturday night the life of the President of the French Republic was taken by an Italian assassin .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 59]: Last night a mob surrounded our hotel , shouting , howling , singing the `` Marseillaise , '' and pelting our windows with sticks and stones ; for we have Italian waiters , and the mob demanded that they be turned out of the house instantly -- to be drubbed , and then driven out of the village .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 85]: Everybody in the hotel remained up until far into the night , and experienced the several kinds of terror which one reads about in books which tell of nigh attacks by Italians and by French mobs : the growing roar of the oncoming crowd ; the arrival , with rain of stones and a crash of glass ; the withdrawal to rearrange plans -- followed by a silence ominous , threatening , and harder to bear than even the active siege and the noise .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 28]: The landlord and the two village policemen stood their ground , and at last the mob was persuaded to go away and leave our Italians in peace .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 25]: Today four of the ringleaders have been sentenced to heavy punishment of a public sort -- and are become local heroes , by consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 19]: That is the very mistake which was at first made in the Missourian village half a century ago .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 17]: The mistake was repeated and repeated -- just as France is doing in these later months .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 31]: In our village we had our Ravochals , our Henrys , our Vaillants ; and in a humble way our Cesario -- I hope I have spelled this name wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 37]: Fifty years ago we passed through , in all essentials , what France has been passing through during the past two or three years , in the matter of periodical frights , horrors , and shudderings .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 9]: In several details the parallels are quaintly exact .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 27]: In that day , for a man to speak out openly and proclaim himself an enemy of negro slavery was simply to proclaim himself a madman .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 22]: For he was blaspheming against the holiest thing known to a Missourian , and could NOT be in his right mind .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 31]: For a man to proclaim himself an anarchist in France , three years ago , was to proclaim himself a madman -- he could not be in his right mind .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 44]: Now the original first blasphemer against any institution profoundly venerated by a community is quite sure to be in earnest ; his followers and imitators may be humbugs and self-seekers , but he himself is sincere -- his heart is in his protest .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 10]: Robert Hardy was our first ABOLITIONIST -- awful name !
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 31]: He was a journeyman cooper , and worked in the big cooper-shop belonging to the great pork-packing establishment which was Marion City 's chief pride and sole source of prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 8]: He was a New-Englander , a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 52]: And , being a stranger , he was of course regarded as an inferior person -- for that has been human nature from Adam down -- and of course , also , he was made to feel unwelcome , for this is the ancient law with man and the other animals .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 18]: Hardy was thirty years old , and a bachelor ; pale , given to reverie and reading .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 17]: He was reserved , and seemed to prefer the isolation which had fallen to his lot .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 27]: He was treated to many side remarks by his fellows , but as he did not resent them it was decided that he was a coward .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 15]: All of a sudden he proclaimed himself an abolitionist -- straight out and publicly !
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 12]: He said that negro slavery was a crime , an infamy .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 27]: For a moment the town was paralyzed with astonishment ; then it broke into a fury of rage and swarmed toward the cooper-shop to lynch Hardy .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 15]: But the Methodist minister made a powerful speech to them and stayed their hands .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 26]: He proved to them that Hardy was insane and not responsible for his words ; that no man COULD be sane and utter such words .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 5]: So Hardy was saved .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 11]: Being insane , he was allowed to go on talking .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 8]: He was found to be good entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 22]: Several nights running he made abolition speeches in the open air , and all the town flocked to hear and laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 46]: He implored them to believe him sane and sincere , and have pity on the poor slaves , and take measurements for the restoration of their stolen rights , or in no long time blood would flow -- blood , blood , rivers of blood !
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 5]: It was great fun .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 11]: But all of a sudden the aspect of things changed .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 43]: A slave came flying from Palmyra , the county-seat , a few miles back , and was about to escape in a canoe to Illinois and freedom in the dull twilight of the approaching dawn , when the town constable seized him .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 26]: Hardy happened along and tried to rescue the negro ; there was a struggle , and the constable did not come out of it alive .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 17]: Hardly crossed the river with the negro , and then came back to give himself up .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 36]: All this took time , for the Mississippi is not a French brook , like the Seine , the Loire , and those other rivulets , but is a real river nearly a mile wide .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 57]: The town was on hand in force by now , but the Methodist preacher and the sheriff had already made arrangements in the interest of order ; so Hardy was surrounded by a strong guard and safely conveyed to the village calaboose in spite of all the effort of the mob to get hold of him .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 28]: The reader will have begun to perceive that this Methodist minister was a prompt man ; a prompt man , with active hands and a good headpiece .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 30]: Williams was his name -- Damon Williams ; Damon Williams in public , Damnation Williams in private , because he was so powerful on that theme and so frequent .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 5]: The excitement was prodigious .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 15]: The constable was the first man who had ever been killed in the town .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 15]: The event was by long odds the most imposing in the town 's history .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 21]: It lifted the humble village into sudden importance ; its name was in everybody 's mouth for twenty miles around .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 18]: And so was the name of Robert Hardy -- Robert Hardy , the stranger , the despised .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 21]: In a day he was become the person of most consequence in the region , the only person talked about .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 41]: As to those other coopers , they found their position curiously changed -- they were important people , or unimportant , now , in proportion as to how large or how small had been their intercourse with the new celebrity .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 32]: The two or three who had really been on a sort of familiar footing with him found themselves objects of admiring interest with the public and of envy with their shopmates .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 11]: The village weekly journal had lately gone into new hands .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 17]: The new man was an enterprising fellow , and he made the most of the tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 5]: He issued an extra .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 39]: Then he put up posters promising to devote his whole paper to matters connected with the great event -- there would be a full and intensely interesting biography of the murderer , and even a portrait of him .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 8]: He was as good as his word .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 23]: He carved the portrait himself , on the back of a wooden type -- and a terror it was to look at .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 21]: It made a great commotion , for this was the first time the village paper had ever contained a picture .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 6]: The village was very proud .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 23]: The output of the paper was ten times as great as it had ever been before , yet every copy was sold .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 42]: When the trial came on , people came from all the farms around , and from Hannibal , and Quincy , and even from Keokuk ; and the court-house could hold only a fraction of the crowd that applied for admission .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 20]: The trial was published in the village paper , with fresh and still more trying pictures of the accused .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 10]: Hardy was convicted , and hanged -- a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 30]: People came from miles around to see the hanging ; they brought cakes and cider , also the women and children , and made a picnic of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 11]: It was the largest crowd the village had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 24]: The rope that hanged Hardy was eagerly bought up , in inch samples , for everybody wanted a memento of the memorable event .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 8]: Martyrdom gilded with notoriety has its fascinations .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 14]: Within one week afterward four young lightweights in the village proclaimed themselves abolitionists !
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 25]: In life Hardy had not been able to make a convert ; everybody laughed at him ; but nobody could laugh at his legacy .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 20]: The four swaggered around with their slouch-hats pulled down over their faces , and hinted darkly at awful possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 11]: The people were troubled and afraid , and showed it .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 13]: And they were stunned , too ; they could not understand it .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 37]: `` Abolitionist '' had always been a term of shame and horror ; yet here were four young men who were not only not ashamed to bear that name , but were grimly proud of it .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 19]: Respectable young men they were , too -- of good families , and brought up in the church .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 30]: Ed Smith , the printer 's apprentice , nineteen , had been the head Sunday-school boy , and had once recited three thousand Bible verses without making a break .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 31]: Dick Savage , twenty , the baker 's apprentice ; Will Joyce , twenty-two , journeyman blacksmith ; and Henry Taylor , twenty-four , tobacco-stemmer -- were the other three .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 44]: They were all of a sentimental cast ; they were all romance-readers ; they all wrote poetry , such as it was ; they were all vain and foolish ; but they had never before been suspected of having anything bad in them .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 14]: They withdrew from society , and grew more and more mysterious and dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 20]: They presently achieved the distinction of being denounced by names from the pulpit -- which made an immense stir !
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 8]: This was grandeur , this was fame .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 11]: They were envied by all the other young fellows now .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 4]: This was natural .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 7]: Their company grew -- grew alarmingly .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 5]: They took a name .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 20]: It was a secret name , and was divulged to no outsider ; publicly they were simply the abolitionists .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 27]: They had pass-words , grips , and signs ; they had secret meetings ; their initiations were conducted with gloomy pomps and ceremonies , at midnight .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 63]: They always spoke of Hardy as `` the Martyr , '' and every little while they moved through the principal street in procession -- at midnight , black-robed , masked , to the measured tap of the solemn drum -- on pilgrimage to the Martyr 's grave , where they went through with some majestic fooleries and swore vengeance upon his murderers .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 31]: They gave previous notice of the pilgrimage by small posters , and warned everybody to keep indoors and darken all houses along the route , and leave the road empty .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 19]: These warnings were obeyed , for there was a skull and crossbones at the top of the poster .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 19]: When this kind of thing had been going on about eight weeks , a quite natural thing happened .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 54]: A few men of character and grit woke up out of the nightmare of fear which had been stupefying their faculties , and began to discharge scorn and scoffings at themselves and the community for enduring this child 's - play ; and at the same time they proposed to end it straightway .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 25]: Everybody felt an uplift ; life was breathed into their dead spirits ; their courage rose and they began to feel like men again .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 6]: This was on a Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 23]: All day the new feeling grew and strengthened ; it grew with a rush ; it brought inspiration and cheer with it .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 27]: Midnight saw a united community , full of zeal and pluck , and with a clearly defined and welcome piece of work in front of it .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 44]: The best organizer and strongest and bitterest talker on that great Saturday was the Presbyterian clergyman who had denounced the original four from his pulpit -- Rev. Hiram Fletcher -- and he promised to use his pulpit in the public interest again now .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 18]: On the morrow he had revelations to make , he said -- secrets of the dreadful society .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 7]: But the revelations were never made .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 40]: At half past two in the morning the dead silence of the village was broken by a crashing explosion , and the town patrol saw the preacher 's house spring in a wreck of whirling fragments into the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 17]: The preacher was killed , together with a negro woman , his only slave and servant .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 10]: The town was paralyzed again , and with reason .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 59]: To struggle against a visible enemy is a thing worth while , and there is a plenty of men who stand always ready to undertake it ; but to struggle against an invisible one -- an invisible one who sneaks in and does his awful work in the dark and leaves no trace -- that is another matter .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 13]: That is a thing to make the bravest tremble and hold back .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 11]: The cowed populace were afraid to go to the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 28]: The man who was to have had a packed church to hear him expose and denounce the common enemy had but a handful to see him buried .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 36]: The coroner 's jury had brought in a verdict of `` death by the visitation of God , '' for no witness came forward ; if any existed they prudently kept out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 4]: Nobody seemed sorry .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 16]: Nobody wanted to see the terrible secret society provoked into the commission of further outrages .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 14]: Everybody wanted the tragedy hushed up , ignored , forgotten , if possible .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 28]: And so there was a bitter surprise and an unwelcome one when Will Joyce , the blacksmith 's journeyman , came out and proclaimed himself the assassin !
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 12]: Plainly he was not minded to be robbed of his glory .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 10]: He made his proclamation , and stuck to it .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 10]: Stuck to it , and insisted upon a trial .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 37]: Here was an ominous thing ; here was a new and peculiarly formidable terror , for a motive was revealed here which society could not hope to deal with successfully -- VANITY , thirst for notoriety .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 40]: If men were going to kill for notoriety 's sake , and to win the glory of newspaper renown , a big trial , and a showy execution , what possible invention of man could discourage or deter them ?
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 17]: The town was in a sort of panic ; it did not know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 18]: However , the grand jury had to take hold of the matter -- it had no choice .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 17]: It brought in a true bill , and presently the case went to the county court .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 7]: The trial was a fine sensation .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 10]: The prisoner was the principal witness for the prosecution .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 71]: He gave a full account of the assassination ; he furnished even the minutest particulars : how he deposited his keg of powder and laid his train -- from the house to such-and-such a spot ; how George Ronalds and Henry Hart came along just then , smoking , and he borrowed Hart 's cigar and fired the train with it , shouting , `` Down with all slave-tyrants ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 25]: and how Hart and Ronalds made no effort to capture him , but ran away , and had never come forward to testify yet .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 26]: But they had to testify now , and they did -- and pitiful it was to see how reluctant they were , and how scared .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 47]: The crowded house listened to Joyce 's fearful tale with a profound and breathless interest , and in a deep hush which was not broken till he broke it himself , in concluding , with a roaring repetition of his `` Death to all slave-tyrants ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 19]: -- which came so unexpectedly and so startlingly that it made everyone present catch his breath and gasp .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 28]: The trial was put in the paper , with biography and large portrait , with other slanderous and insane pictures , and the edition sold beyond imagination .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 11]: The execution of Joyce was a fine and picturesque thing .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 6]: It drew a vast crowd .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 23]: Good places in trees and seats on rail fences sold for half a dollar apiece ; lemonade and gingerbread-stands had great prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 53]: Joyce recited a furious and fantastic and denunciatory speech on the scaffold which had imposing passages of school-boy eloquence in it , and gave him a reputation on the spot as an orator , and his name , later , in the society 's records , of the `` Martyr Orator . ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 18]: He went to his death breathing slaughter and charging his society to `` avenge his murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 30]: If he knew anything of human nature he knew that to plenty of young fellows present in that great crowd he was a grand hero -- and enviably situated .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 4]: He was hanged .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 5]: It was a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 25]: Within a month from his death the society which he had honored had twenty new members , some of them earnest , determined men .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 16]: They did not court distinction in the same way , but they celebrated his martyrdom .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 14]: The crime which had been obscure and despised had become lofty and glorified .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 9]: Such things were happening all over the country .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 9]: Wild-brained martyrdom was succeeded by uprising and organization .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 19]: Then , in natural order , followed riot , insurrection , and the wrack and restitutions of war .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 15]: It was bound to come , and it would naturally come in that way .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 14]: It has been the manner of reform since the beginning of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 12]: SWITZERLAND , THE CRADLE OF LIBERTY Interlaken , Switzerland , 1891 .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 13]: It is a good many years since I was in Switzerland last .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 14]: In that remote time there was only one ladder railway in the country .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 8]: That state of things is all changed .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 39]: There is n't a mountain in Switzerland now that has n't a ladder railroad or two up its back like suspenders ; indeed , some mountains are latticed with them , and two years hence all will be .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 37]: In that day the peasant of the high altitudes will have to carry a lantern when he goes visiting in the night to keep from stumbling over railroads that have been built since his last round .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 32]: And also in that day , if there shall remain a high-altitude peasant whose potato-patch has n't a railroad through it , it would make him as conspicuous as William Tell .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 13]: However , there are only two best ways to travel through Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 6]: The first best is afloat .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 9]: The second best is by open two-horse carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 47]: One can come from Lucerne to Interlaken over the Brunig by ladder railroad in an hour or so now , but you can glide smoothly in a carriage in ten , and have two hours for luncheon at noon -- for luncheon , not for rest .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 9]: There is no fatigue connected with the trip .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 37]: One arrives fresh in spirit and in person in the evening -- no fret in his heart , no grime on his face , no grit in his hair , not a cinder in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 47]: This is the right condition of mind and body , the right and due preparation for the solemn event which closed the day -- stepping with metaphorically uncovered head into the presence of the most impressive mountain mass that the globe can show -- the Jungfrau .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 26]: The stranger 's first feeling , when suddenly confronted by that towering and awful apparition wrapped in its shroud of snow , is breath-taking astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 15]: It is as if heaven 's gates had swung open and exposed the throne .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 9]: It is peaceful here and pleasant at Interlaken .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 12]: Nothing going on -- at least nothing but brilliant life-giving sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 8]: There are floods and floods of that .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 33]: One may properly speak of it as `` going on , '' for it is full of the suggestion of activity ; the light pours down with energy , with visible enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 15]: This is a good atmosphere to be in , morally as well as physically .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 60]: After trying the political atmosphere of the neighboring monarchies , it is healing and refreshing to breathe air that has known no taint of slavery for six hundred years , and to come among a people whose political history is great and fine , and worthy to be taught in all schools and studied by all races and peoples .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 45]: For the struggle here throughout the centuries has not been in the interest of any private family , or any church , but in the interest of the whole body of the nation , and for shelter and protection of all forms of belief .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 5]: This fact is colossal .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 50]: If one would realize how colossal it is , and of what dignity and majesty , let him contrast it with the purposes and objects of the Crusades , the siege of York , the War of the Roses , and other historic comedies of that sort and size .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 19]: Last week I was beating around the Lake of Four Cantons , and I saw Rutli and Altorf .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 107]: Rutli is a remote little patch of meadow , but I do not know how any piece of ground could be holier or better worth crossing oceans and continents to see , since it was there that the great trinity of Switzerland joined hands six centuries ago and swore the oath which set their enslaved and insulted country forever free ; and Altorf is also honorable ground and worshipful , since it was there that William , surnamed Tell -LRB- which interpreted means `` The foolish talker '' -- that is to say , the too-daring talker -RRB- , refused to bow to Gessler 's hat .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 39]: Of late years the prying student of history has been delighting himself beyond measure over a wonderful find which he has made -- to wit , that Tell did not shoot the apple from his son 's head .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 46]: To hear the students jubilate , one would suppose that the question of whether Tell shot the apple or did n't was an important matter ; whereas it ranks in importance exactly with the question of whether Washington chopped down the cherry-tree or did n't .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 21]: The deeds of Washington , the patriot , are the essential thing ; the cherry-tree incident is of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 47]: To prove that Tell did shoot the apple from his son 's head would merely prove that he had better nerve than most men and was skillful with a bow as a million others who preceded and followed him , but not one whit more so .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 69]: But Tell was more and better than a mere marksman , more and better than a mere cool head ; he was a type ; he stands for Swiss patriotism ; in his person was represented a whole people ; his spirit was their spirit -- the spirit which would bow to none but God , the spirit which said this in words and confirmed it with deeds .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 14]: There have always been Tells in Switzerland -- people who would not bow .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 26]: There was a sufficiency of them at Rutli ; there were plenty of them at Murten ; plenty at Grandson ; there are plenty today .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 33]: And the first of them all -- the very first , earliest banner-bearer of human freedom in this world -- was not a man , but a woman -- Stauffacher 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 48]: There she looms dim and great , through the haze of the centuries , delivering into her husband 's ear that gospel of revolt which was to bear fruit in the conspiracy of Rutli and the birth of the first free government the world had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 31]: From this Victoria Hotel one looks straight across a flat of trifling width to a lofty mountain barrier , which has a gateway in it shaped like an inverted pyramid .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 22]: Beyond this gateway arises the vast bulk of the Jungfrau , a spotless mass of gleaming snow , into the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 17]: The gateway , in the dark-colored barrier , makes a strong frame for the great picture .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 11]: The somber frame and the glowing snow-pile are startlingly contrasted .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 30]: It is this frame which concentrates and emphasizes the glory of the Jungfrau and makes it the most engaging and beguiling and fascinating spectacle that exists on the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 24]: There are many mountains of snow that are as lofty as the Jungfrau and as nobly proportioned , but they lack the fame .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 27]: They stand at large ; they are intruded upon and elbowed by neighboring domes and summits , and their grandeur is diminished and fails of effect .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 10]: It is a good name , Jungfrau -- Virgin .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 17]: Nothing could be whiter ; nothing could be purer ; nothing could be saintlier of aspect .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 44]: At six yesterday evening the great intervening barrier seen through a faint bluish haze seemed made of air and substanceless , so soft and rich it was , so shimmering where the wandering lights touched it and so dim where the shadows lay .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 18]: Apparently it was a dream stuff , a work of the imagination , nothing real about it .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 16]: The tint was green , slightly varying shades of it , but mainly very dark .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 27]: The sun was down -- as far as that barrier was concerned , but not for the Jungfrau , towering into the heavens beyond the gateway .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 9]: She was a roaring conflagration of blinding white .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 27]: It is said the Fridolin -LRB- the old Fridolin -RRB- , a new saint , but formerly a missionary , gave the mountain its gracious name .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 30]: He was an Irishman , son of an Irish king -- there were thirty thousand kings reigning in County Cork alone in his time , fifteen hundred years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 22]: It got so that they could not make a living , there was so much competition and wages got cut so .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 28]: Some of them were out of work months at a time , with wife and little children to feed , and not a crust in the place .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 45]: At last a particularly severe winter fell upon the country , and hundreds of them were reduced to mendicancy and were to be seen day after day in the bitterest weather , standing barefoot in the snow , holding out their crowns for alms .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 43]: Indeed , they would have been obliged to emigrate or starve but for a fortunate idea of Prince Fridolin 's , who started a labor-union , the first one in history , and got the great bulk of them to join it .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 39]: He thus won the general gratitude , and they wanted to make him emperor -- emperor over them all -- emperor of County Cork , but he said , No , walking delegate was good enough for him .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 3]: For behold !
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 13]: he was modest beyond his years , and keen as a whip .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 28]: To this day in Germany and Switzerland , where St. Fridolin is revered and honored , the peasantry speak of him affectionately as the first walking delegate .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 28]: The first walk he took was into France and Germany , missionarying -- for missionarying was a better thing in those days than it is in ours .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 54]: All you had to do was to cure the savage 's sick daughter by a `` miracle '' -- a miracle like the miracle of Lourdes in our day , for instance -- and immediately that head savage was your convert , and filled to the eyes with a new convert 's enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 11]: You could sit down and make yourself easy , now .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 14]: He would take an ax and convert the rest of the nation himself .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 9]: Charlemagne was that kind of a walking delegate .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 20]: Yes , there were great missionaries in those days , for the methods were sure and the rewards great .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 12]: We have no such missionaries now , and no such methods .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 16]: But to continue the history of the first walking delegate , if you are interested .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 41]: I am interested myself because I have seen his relics in Sackingen , and also the very spot where he worked his great miracle -- the one which won him his sainthood in the papal court a few centuries later .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 24]: To have seen these things makes me feel very near to him , almost like a member of the family , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 33]: While wandering about the Continent he arrived at the spot on the Rhine which is now occupied by Sackingen , and proposed to settle there , but the people warned him off .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 23]: He appealed to the king of the Franks , who made him a present of the whole region , people and all .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 19]: He built a great cloister there for women and proceeded to teach in it and accumulate more land .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 13]: There were two wealthy brothers in the neighborhood , Urso and Landulph .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 8]: Urso died and Fridolin claimed his estates .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 7]: Landulph asked for documents and papers .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 6]: Fridolin had none to show .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 14]: He said the bequest had been made to him by word of mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 23]: Landulph suggested that he produce a witness and said it in a way which he thought was very witty , very sarcastic .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 11]: This shows that he did not know the walking delegate .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 5]: Fridolin was not disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 8]: He said : `` Appoint your court .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 7]: I will bring a witness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 11]: The court thus created consisted of fifteen counts and barons .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 11]: A day was appointed for the trial of the case .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 23]: On that day the judges took their seats in state , and proclamation was made that the court was ready for business .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 16]: Five minutes , ten minutes , fifteen minutes passed , and yet no Fridolin appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 25]: Landulph rose , and was in the act of claiming judgment by default when a strange clacking sound was heard coming up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 29]: In another moment Fridolin entered at the door and came walking in a deep hush down the middle aisle , with a tall skeleton stalking in his rear .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 18]: Amazement and terror sat upon every countenance , for everybody suspected that the skeleton was Urso 's .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 35]: It stopped before the chief judge and raised its bony arm aloft and began to speak , while all the assembled shuddered , for they could see the words leak out between its ribs .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 30]: It said : `` Brother , why dost thou disturb my blessed rest and withhold by robbery the gift which I gave thee for the honor of God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 28]: It seems a strange thing and most irregular , but the verdict was actually given against Landulph on the testimony of this wandering rack-heap of unidentified bones .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 40]: In our day a skeleton would not be allowed to testify at all , for a skeleton has no moral responsibility , and its word could not be believed on oath , and this was probably one of them .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 71]: However , the incident is valuable as preserving to us a curious sample of the quaint laws of evidence of that remote time -- a time so remote , so far back toward the beginning of original idiocy , that the difference between a bench of judges and a basket of vegetables was as yet so slight that we may say with all confidence that it did n't really exist .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 73]: During several afternoons I have been engaged in an interesting , maybe useful , piece of work -- that is to say , I have been trying to make the mighty Jungfrau earn her living -- earn it in a most humble sphere , but on a prodigious scale , on a prodigious scale of necessity , for she could n't do anything in a small way with her size and style .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 62]: I have been trying to make her do service on a stupendous dial and check off the hours as they glide along her pallid face up there against the sky , and tell the time of day to the populations lying within fifty miles of her and to the people in the moon , if they have a good telescope there .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 24]: Until late in the afternoon the Jungfrau 's aspect is that of a spotless desert of snow set upon edge against the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 41]: But by mid-afternoon some elevations which rise out of the western border of the desert , whose presence you perhaps had not detected or suspected up to that time , began to cast black shadows eastward across the gleaming surface .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 13]: At first there is only one shadow ; later there are two .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 36]: Toward 4 P.M. the other day I was gazing and worshiping as usual when I chanced to notice that shadow No. 1 was beginning to take itself something of the shape of the human profile .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 48]: By four the back of the head was good , the military cap was pretty good , the nose was bold and strong , the upper lip sharp , but not pretty , and there was a great goatee that shot straight aggressively forward from the chin .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 250]: At four-thirty the nose had changed its shape considerably , and the altered slant of the sun had revealed and made conspicuous a huge buttress or barrier of naked rock which was so located as to answer very well for a shoulder or coat-collar to this swarthy and indiscreet sweetheart who had stolen out there right before everybody to pillow his head on the Virgin 's white breast and whisper soft sentimentalities to her in the sensuous music of the crashing ice-domes and the boom and thunder of the passing avalanche -- music very familiar to his ear , for he had heard it every afternoon at this hour since the day he first came courting this child of the earth , who lives in the sky , and that day is far , yes -- for he was at this pleasant sport before the Middle Ages drifted by him in the valley ; before the Romans marched past , and before the antique and recordless barbarians fished and hunted here and wondered who he might be , and were probably afraid of him ; and before primeval man himself , just emerged from his four-footed estate , stepped out upon this plain , first sample of his race , a thousand centuries ago , and cast a glad eye up there , judging he had found a brother human being and consequently something to kill ; and before the big saurians wallowed here , still some eons earlier .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 76]: Oh yes , a day so far back that the eternal son was present to see that first visit ; a day so far back that neither tradition nor history was born yet and a whole weary eternity must come and go before the restless little creature , of whose face this stupendous Shadow Face was the prophecy , would arrive in the earth and begin his shabby career and think of a big thing .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 34]: Oh , indeed yes ; when you talk about your poor Roman and Egyptian day-before-yesterday antiquities , you should choose a time when the hoary Shadow Face of the Jungfrau is not by .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 22]: It antedates all antiquities known or imaginable ; for it was here the world itself created the theater of future antiquities .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 27]: And it is the only witness with a human face that was there to see the marvel , and remains to us a memorial of it .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 14]: By 4:40 P.M. the nose of the shadow is perfect and is beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 25]: It is black and is powerfully marked against the upright canvas of glowing snow , and covers hundreds of acres of that resplendent surface .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 39]: Meantime shadow No. 2 has been creeping out well to the rear of the face west of it -- and at five o'clock has assumed a shape that has rather a poor and rude semblance of a shoe .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 33]: Meantime , also , the great Shadow Face has been gradually changing for twenty minutes , and now , 5 P.M. , it is becoming a quite fair portrait of Roscoe Conkling .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 9]: The likeness is there , and is unmistakable .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 26]: The goatee is shortened , now , and has an end ; formerly it had n't any , but ran off eastward and arrived nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 47]: By 6 P.M. the face has dissolved and gone , and the goatee has become what looks like the shadow of a tower with a pointed roof , and the shoe had turned into what the printers call a `` fist '' with a finger pointing .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 81]: If I were now imprisoned on a mountain summit a hundred miles northward of this point , and was denied a timepiece , I could get along well enough from four till six on clear days , for I could keep trace of the time by the changing shapes of these mighty shadows of the Virgin 's front , the most stupendous dial I am acquainted with , the oldest clock in the world by a couple of million years .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 53]: I suppose I should not have noticed the forms of the shadows if I had n't the habit of hunting for faces in the clouds and in mountain crags -- a sort of amusement which is very entertaining even when you do n't find any , and brilliantly satisfying when you do .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 72]: I have searched through several bushels of photographs of the Jungfrau here , but found only one with the Face in it , and in this case it was not strictly recognizable as a face , which was evidence that the picture was taken before four o'clock in the afternoon , and also evidence that all the photographers have persistently overlooked one of the most fascinating features of the Jungfrau show .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 29]: I say fascinating , because if you once detect a human face produced on a great plan by unconscious nature , you never get tired of watching it .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 29]: At first you ca n't make another person see it at all , but after he has made it out once he ca n't see anything else afterward .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 16]: The King of Greece is a man who goes around quietly enough when off duty .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 53]: One day this summer he was traveling in an ordinary first-class compartment , just in his other suit , the one which he works the realm in when he is at home , and so he was not looking like anybody in particular , but a good deal like everybody in general .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 53]: By and by a hearty and healthy German-American got in and opened up a frank and interesting and sympathetic conversation with him , and asked him a couple of thousand questions about himself , which the king answered good-naturedly , but in a more or less indefinite way as to private particulars .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 12]: `` Where do you live when you are at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 5]: `` In Greece . ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 3]: `` Greece !
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 9]: Well , now , that is just astonishing !
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 4]: Born there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 7]: `` Do you speak Greek ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 8]: `` Now , ai n't that strange !
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 9]: I never expected to live to see that .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 5]: What is your trade ?
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 9]: I mean how do you get your living ?
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 8]: What is your line of business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 10]: `` Well , I hardly know how to answer .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 27]: I am only a kind of foreman , on a salary ; and the business -- well , is a very general kind of business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 21]: `` Yes , I understand -- general jobbing -- little of everything -- anything that there 's money in . ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 9]: `` That 's about it , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 10]: `` Are you traveling for the house now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 9]: `` Well , partly ; but not entirely .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 19]: Of course I do a stroke of business if it falls in the way -- '' `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 6]: I like that in you !
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 6]: That 's me every time .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 4]: Go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 16]: `` I was only going to say I am off on my vacation now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 7]: `` Well that 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 5]: No harm in that .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 14]: A man works all the better for a little let-up now and then .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 16]: Not that I 've been used to having it myself ; for I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 7]: I reckon this is my first .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 36]: I was born in Germany , and when I was a couple of weeks old shipped to America , and I 've been there ever since , and that 's sixty-four years by the watch .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 19]: I 'm an American in principle and a German at heart , and it 's the boss combination .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 16]: Well , how do you get along , as a rule -- pretty fair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 27]: `` I 've a rather large family -- '' `` There , that 's it -- big family and trying to raise them on a salary .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 12]: Now , what did you go to do that for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 13]: `` Well , I thought -- '' `` Of course you did .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 27]: You were young and confident and thought you could branch out and make things go with a whirl , and here you are , you see !
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 6]: But never mind about that .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 8]: I 'm not trying to discourage you .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 9]: I 've been just where you are myself !
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 18]: You 've got good grit ; there 's good stuff in you , I can see that .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 12]: You got a wrong start , that 's the whole trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 15]: But you hold your grip , and we 'll see what can be done .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 12]: Your case ai n't half as bad as it might be .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 15]: You are going to come out all right -- I 'm bail for that .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 5]: Boys and girls ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 4]: `` My family ?
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 15]: Yes , some of them are boys -- '' `` And the rest girls .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 7]: It 's just as I expected .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 14]: But that 's all right , and it 's better so , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 11]: What are the boys doing -- learning a trade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 16]: `` Well , no -- I thought -- '' `` It 's a big mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 9]: It 's the biggest mistake you ever made .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 8]: You see that in your own case .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 13]: A man ought always to have a trade to fall back on .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 8]: Now , I was harness-maker at first .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 14]: Did that prevent me from becoming one of the biggest brewers in America ?
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 3]: Oh no .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 14]: I always had the harness trick to fall back on in rough weather .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 22]: Now , if you had learned how to make harness -- However , it 's too late now ; too late .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 12]: But it 's no good plan to cry over spilt milk .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 22]: But as to the boys , you see -- what 's to become of them if anything happens to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 20]: `` It has been my idea to let the eldest one succeed me -- '' `` Oh , come !
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 9]: Suppose the firm do n't want him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 29]: `` I had n't thought of that , but -- '' `` Now , look here ; you want to get right down to business and stop dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 9]: You are capable of immense things -- man .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 9]: You can make a perfect success in life .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 17]: All you want is somebody to steady you and boost you along on the right road .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 9]: Do you own anything in the business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 29]: `` No -- not exactly ; but if I continue to give satisfaction , I suppose I can keep my -- '' `` Keep your place -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 12]: Well , do n't you depend on anything of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 21]: They 'll bounce you the minute you get a little old and worked out ; they 'll do it sure .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 11]: Ca n't you manage somehow to get into the firm ?
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 10]: That 's the great thing , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 11]: `` I think it is doubtful ; very doubtful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 14]: `` Um -- that 's bad -- yes , and unfair , too .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 30]: Do you suppose that if I should go there and have a talk with your people -- Look here -- do you think you could run a brewery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 22]: `` I have never tried , but I think I could do it after a little familiarity with the business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 8]: The German was silent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 23]: He did a good deal of thinking , and the king waited curiously to see what the result was going to be .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 12]: Finally the German said : `` My mind 's made up .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 13]: You leave that crowd -- you 'll never amount to anything there .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 12]: In these old countries they never give a fellow a show .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 20]: Yes , you come over to America -- come to my place in Rochester ; bring the family along .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 14]: You shall have a show in the business and the foremanship , besides .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 9]: George -- you said your name was George ?
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 9]: -- I 'll make a man of you .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 6]: I give you my word .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 16]: You 've never had a chance here , but that 's all going to change .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 3]: By gracious !
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 14]: I 'll give you a lift that 'll make your hair curl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 31]: AT THE SHRINE OF ST. WAGNER Bayreuth , Aug. 2d , 1891 It was at Nuremberg that we struck the inundation of music-mad strangers that was rolling down upon Bayreuth .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 16]: It had been long since we had seen such multitudes of excited and struggling people .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 28]: It took a good half-hour to pack them and pair them into the train -- and it was the longest train we have yet seen in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 19]: Nuremberg had been witnessing this sort of experience a couple of times a day for about two weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 14]: It gives one an impressive sense of the magnitude of this biennial pilgrimage .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 8]: For a pilgrimage is what it is .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 23]: The devotees come from the very ends of the earth to worship their prophet in his own Kaaba in his own Mecca .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 70]: If you are living in New York or San Francisco or Chicago or anywhere else in America , and you conclude , by the middle of May , that you would like to attend the Bayreuth opera two months and a half later , you must use the cable and get about it immediately or you will get no seats , and you must cable for lodgings , too .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 22]: Then if you are lucky you will get seats in the last row and lodgings in the fringe of the town .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 10]: If you stop to write you will get nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 23]: There were plenty of people in Nuremberg when we passed through who had come on pilgrimage without first securing seats and lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 68]: They had found neither in Bayreuth ; they had walked Bayreuth streets a while in sorrow , then had gone to Nuremberg and found neither beds nor standing room , and had walked those quaint streets all night , waiting for the hotels to open and empty their guests into trains , and so make room for these , their defeated brethren and sisters in the faith .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 84]: They had endured from thirty to forty hours ' railroading on the continent of Europe -- with all which that implies of worry , fatigue , and financial impoverishment -- and all they had got and all they were to get for it was handiness and accuracy in kicking themselves , acquired by practice in the back streets of the two towns when other people were in bed ; for back they must go over that unspeakable journey with their pious mission unfulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 57]: These humiliated outcasts had the frowsy and unbrushed and apologetic look of wet cats , and their eyes were glazed with drowsiness , their bodies were adroop from crown to sole , and all kind-hearted people refrained from asking them if they had been to Bayreuth and failed to connect , as knowing they would lie .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 13]: We reached here -LRB- Bayreuth -RRB- about mid-afternoon of a rainy Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 17]: We were of the wise , and had secured lodgings and opera seats months in advance .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 25]: I am not a musical critic , and did not come here to write essays about the operas and deliver judgment upon their merits .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 40]: The little children of Bayreuth could do that with a finer sympathy and a broader intelligence than I. I only care to bring four or five pilgrims to the operas , pilgrims able to appreciate them and enjoy them .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 34]: What I write about the performance to put in my odd time would be offered to the public as merely a cat 's view of a king , and not of didactic value .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 31]: Next day , which was Sunday , we left for the opera-house -- that is to say , the Wagner temple -- a little after the middle of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 20]: The great building stands all by itself , grand and lonely , on a high ground outside the town .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 27]: We were warned that if we arrived after four o'clock we should be obliged to pay two dollars and a half extra by way of fine .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 23]: We saved that ; and it may be remarked here that this is the only opportunity that Europe offers of saving money .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 24]: There was a big crowd in the grounds about the building , and the ladies ' dresses took the sun with fine effect .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 20]: I do not mean to intimate that the ladies were in full dress , for that was not so .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 13]: The dresses were pretty , but neither sex was in evening dress .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 29]: The interior of the building is simple -- severely so ; but there is no occasion for color and decoration , since the people sit in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 17]: The auditorium has the shape of a keystone , with the stage at the narrow end .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 18]: There is an aisle on each side , but no aisle in the body of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 19]: Each row of seats extends in an unbroken curve from one side of the house to the other .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 26]: There are seven entrance doors on each side of the theater and four at the butt , eighteen doors to admit and emit 1,650 persons .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 33]: The number of the particular door by which you are to enter the house or leave it is printed on your ticket , and you can use no door but that one .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 8]: Thus , crowding and confusion are impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 12]: Not so many as a hundred people use any one door .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 15]: This is better than having the usual -LRB- and useless -RRB- elaborate fireproof arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 9]: It is the model theater of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 15]: It can be emptied while the second hand of a watch makes its circuit .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 15]: It would be entirely safe , even if it were built of lucifer matches .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 33]: If your seat is near the center of a row and you enter late you must work your way along a rank of about twenty-five ladies and gentlemen to get to it .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 28]: Yet this causes no trouble , for everybody stands up until all the seats are full , and the filling is accomplished in a very few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 32]: Then all sit down , and you have a solid mass of fifteen hundred heads , making a steep cellar-door slant from the rear of the house down to the stage .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 20]: All the lights were turned low , so low that the congregation sat in a deep and solemn gloom .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 28]: The funereal rustling of dresses and the low buzz of conversation began to die swiftly down , and presently not the ghost of a sound was left .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 23]: This profound and increasingly impressive stillness endured for some time -- the best preparation for music , spectacle , or speech conceivable .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 57]: I should think our show people would have invented or imported that simple and impressive device for securing and solidifying the attention of an audience long ago ; instead of which there continue to this day to open a performance against a deadly competition in the form of noise , confusion , and a scattered interest .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 40]: Finally , out of darkness and distance and mystery soft rich notes rose upon the stillness , and from his grave the dead magician began to weave his spells about his disciples and steep their souls in his enchantments .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 63]: There was something strangely impressive in the fancy which kept intruding itself that the composer was conscious in his grave of what was going on here , and that these divine souls were the clothing of thoughts which were at this moment passing through his brain , and not recognized and familiar ones which had issued from it at some former time .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 20]: The entire overture , long as it was , was played to a dark house with the curtain down .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 8]: It was exquisite ; it was delicious .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 39]: But straightway thereafter , or course , came the singing , and it does seem to me that nothing can make a Wagner opera absolutely perfect and satisfactory to the untutored but to leave out the vocal parts .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 13]: I wish I could see a Wagner opera done in pantomime once .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 86]: Then one would have the lovely orchestration unvexed to listen to and bathe his spirit in , and the bewildering beautiful scenery to intoxicate his eyes with , and the dumb acting could n't mar these pleasures , because there is n't often anything in the Wagner opera that one would call by such a violent name as acting ; as a rule all you would see would be a couple of silent people , one of them standing still , the other catching flies .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 56]: Of course I do not really mean that he would be catching flies ; I only mean that the usual operatic gestures which consist in reaching first one hand out into the air and then the other might suggest the sport I speak of if the operator attended strictly to business and uttered no sound .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 8]: This present opera was `` Parsifal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 12]: Madame Wagner does not permit its representation anywhere but in Bayreuth .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 20]: The first act of the three occupied two hours , and I enjoyed that in spite of the singing .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 82]: I trust that I know as well as anybody that singing is one of the most entrancing and bewitching and moving and eloquent of all the vehicles invented by man for the conveying of feeling ; but it seems to me that the chief virtue in song is melody , air , tune , rhythm , or what you please to call it , and that when this feature is absent what remains is a picture with the color left out .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 111]: I was not able to detect in the vocal parts of `` Parsifal '' anything that might with confidence be called rhythm or tune or melody ; one person performed at a time -- and a long time , too -- often in a noble , and always in a high-toned , voice ; but he only pulled out long notes , then some short ones , then another long one , then a sharp , quick , peremptory bark or two -- and so on and so on ; and when he was done you saw that the information which he had conveyed had not compensated for the disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 7]: Not always , but pretty often .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 25]: If two of them would but put in a duet occasionally and blend the voices ; but no , they do n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 44]: The great master , who knew so well how to make a hundred instruments rejoice in unison and pour out their souls in mingled and melodious tides of delicious sound , deals only in barren solos when he puts in the vocal parts .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 29]: It may be that he was deep , and only added the singing to his operas for the sake of the contrast it would make with the music .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 2]: Singing !
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 11]: It does seem the wrong name to apply to it .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 15]: Strictly described , it is a practicing of difficult and unpleasant intervals , mainly .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 23]: An ignorant person gets tired of listening to gymnastic intervals in the long run , no matter how pleasant they may be .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 46]: In `` Parsifal '' there is a hermit named Gurnemanz who stands on the stage in one spot and practices by the hour , while first one and then another character of the cast endures what he can of it and then retires to die .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 25]: During the evening there was an intermission of three-quarters of an hour after the first act and one an hour long after the second .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 9]: In both instances the theater was totally emptied .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 27]: People who had previously engaged tables in the one sole eating-house were able to put in their time very satisfactorily ; the other thousand went hungry .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 14]: The opera was concluded at ten in the evening or a little later .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 13]: When we reached home we had been gone more than seven hours .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 15]: Seven hours at five dollars a ticket is almost too much for the money .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 62]: While browsing about the front yard among the crowd between the acts I encountered twelve or fifteen friends from different parts of America , and those of them who were most familiar with Wagner said that `` Parsifal '' seldom pleased at first , but that after one had heard it several times it was almost sure to become a favorite .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 23]: It seemed impossible , but it was true , for the statement came from people whose word was not to be doubted .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 7]: And I gathered some further information .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 53]: On the ground I found part of a German musical magazine , and in it a letter written by Uhlic thirty-three years ago , in which he defends the scorned and abused Wagner against people like me , who found fault with the comprehensive absence of what our kind regards as singing .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 25]: Uhlic says Wagner despised `` JENE PLAPPERUDE MUSIC , '' and therefore `` runs , trills , and SCHNORKEL are discarded by him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 32]: I do n't know what a SCHNORKEL is , but now that I know it has been left out of these operas I never have missed so much in my life .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 21]: And Uhlic further says that Wagner 's song is true : that it is `` simply emphasized intoned speech . ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 34]: That certainly describes it -- in `` Parsifal '' and some of the operas ; and if I understand Uhlic 's elaborate German he apologizes for the beautiful airs in `` Tannhauser . ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 48]: Very well ; now that Wagner and I understand each other , perhaps we shall get along better , and I shall stop calling Waggner , on the American plan , and thereafter call him Waggner as per German custom , for I feel entirely friendly now .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 25]: The minute we get reconciled to a person , how willing we are to throw aside little needless punctilios and pronounce his name right !
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 49]: Of course I came home wondering why people should come from all corners of America to hear these operas , when we have lately had a season or two of them in New York with these same singers in the several parts , and possibly this same orchestra .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 10]: I resolved to think that out at all hazards .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 2]: TUESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 34]: -- Yesterday they played the only operatic favorite I have ever had -- an opera which has always driven me mad with ignorant delight whenever I have heard it -- `` Tannhauser . ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 23]: I heard it first when I was a youth ; I heard it last in the last German season in New York .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 50]: I was busy yesterday and I did not intend to go , knowing I should have another `` Tannhauser '' opportunity in a few days ; but after five o'clock I found myself free and walked out to the opera-house and arrived about the beginning of the second act .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 41]: My opera ticket admitted me to the grounds in front , past the policeman and the chain , and I thought I would take a rest on a bench for an hour and two and wait for the third act .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 23]: In a moment or so the first bugles blew , and the multitude began to crumble apart and melt into the theater .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 14]: I will explain that this bugle-call is one of the pretty features here .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 41]: You see , the theater is empty , and hundreds of the audience are a good way off in the feeding-house ; the first bugle-call is blown about a quarter of an hour before time for the curtain to rise .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 48]: This company of buglers , in uniform , march out with military step and send out over the landscape a few bars of the theme of the approaching act , piercing the distances with the gracious notes ; then they march to the other entrance and repeat .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 7]: Presently they do this over again .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 72]: Yesterday only about two hundred people were still left in front of the house when the second call was blown ; in another half-minute they would have been in the house , but then a thing happened which delayed them -- the only solitary thing in this world which could be relied on with certainty to accomplish it , I suppose -- an imperial princess appeared in the balcony above them .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 18]: They stopped dead in their tracks and began to gaze in a stupor of gratitude and satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 25]: The lady presently saw that she must disappear or the doors would be closed upon these worshipers , so she returned to her box .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 30]: This daughter-in-law of an emperor was pretty ; she had a kind face ; she was without airs ; she is known to be full of common human sympathies .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 34]: There are many kinds of princesses , but this kind is the most harmful of all , for wherever they go they reconcile people to monarchy and set back the clock of progress .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 15]: The valuable princes , the desirable princes , are the czars and their sort .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 28]: By their mere dumb presence in the world they cover with derision every argument that can be invented in favor of royalty by the most ingenious casuist .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 11]: In his time the husband of this princess was valuable .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 29]: He led a degraded life , he ended it with his own hand in circumstances and surroundings of a hideous sort , and was buried like a god .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 25]: In the opera-house there is a long loft back of the audience , a kind of open gallery , in which princes are displayed .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 13]: It is sacred to them ; it is the holy of holies .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 38]: As soon as the filling of the house is about complete the standing multitude turn and fix their eyes upon the princely layout and gaze mutely and longingly and adoringly and regretfully like sinners looking into heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 10]: They become rapt , unconscious , steeped in worship .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 12]: There is no spectacle anywhere that is more pathetic than this .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 9]: It is worth crossing many oceans to see .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 111]: It is somehow not the same gaze that people rivet upon a Victor Hugo , or Niagara , or the bones of the mastodon , or the guillotine of the Revolution , or the great pyramid , or distant Vesuvius smoking in the sky , or any man long celebrated to you by his genius and achievements , or thing long celebrated to you by the praises of books and pictures -- no , that gaze is only the gaze of intense curiosity , interest , wonder , engaged in drinking delicious deep draughts that taste good all the way down and appease and satisfy the thirst of a lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 8]: Satisfy it -- that is the word .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 27]: Hugo and the mastodon will still have a degree of intense interest thereafter when encountered , but never anything approaching the ecstasy of that first view .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 8]: The interest of a prince is different .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 35]: It may be envy , it may be worship , doubtless it is a mixture of both -- and it does not satisfy its thirst with one view , or even noticeably diminish it .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 26]: Perhaps the essence of the thing is the value which men attach to a valuable something which has come by luck and not been earned .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 39]: A dollar picked up in the road is more satisfaction to you than the ninety-and-nine which you had to work for , and money won at faro or in stocks snuggles into your heart in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 43]: A prince picks up grandeur , power , and a permanent holiday and gratis support by a pure accident , the accident of birth , and he stands always before the grieved eye of poverty and obscurity a monumental representative of luck .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 19]: And then -- supremest value of all-his is the only high fortune on the earth which is secure .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 77]: The commercial millionaire may become a beggar ; the illustrious statesman can make a vital mistake and be dropped and forgotten ; the illustrious general can lose a decisive battle and with it the consideration of men ; but once a prince always a prince -- that is to say , an imitation god , and neither hard fortune nor an infamous character nor an addled brain nor the speech of an ass can undeify him .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 29]: By common consent of all the nations and all the ages the most valuable thing in this world is the homage of men , whether deserved or undeserved .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 21]: It follows without doubt or question , then , that the most desirable position possible is that of a prince .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 25]: And I think it also follows that the so-called usurpations with which history is littered are the most excusable misdemeanors which men have committed .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 16]: To usurp a usurpation -- that is all it amounts to , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 16]: A prince is not to us what he is to a European , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 41]: We have not been taught to regard him as a god , and so one good look at him is likely to so nearly appease our curiosity as to make him an object of no greater interest the next time .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 6]: We want a fresh one .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 9]: But it is not so with the European .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 7]: I am quite sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 11]: The same old one will answer ; he never stales .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 34]: Eighteen years ago I was in London and I called at an Englishman 's house on a bleak and foggy and dismal December afternoon to visit his wife and married daughter by appointment .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 12]: I waited half an hour and then they arrived , frozen .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 49]: They explained that they had been delayed by an unlooked-for circumstance : while passing in the neighborhood of Marlborough House they saw a crowd gathering and were told that the Prince of Wales was about to drive out , so they stopped to get a sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 28]: They had waited half an hour on the sidewalk , freezing with the crowd , but were disappointed at last -- the Prince had changed his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 34]: I said , with a good deal of surprise , `` Is it possible that you two have lived in London all your lives and have never seen the Prince of Wales ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 18]: Apparently it was their turn to be surprised , for they exclaimed : `` What an idea !
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 11]: Why , we have seen him hundreds of times . ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 44]: They had seem him hundreds of times , yet they had waited half an hour in the gloom and the bitter cold , in the midst of a jam of patients from the same asylum , on the chance of seeing him again .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 24]: It was a stupefying statement , but one is obliged to believe the English , even when they say a thing like that .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 22]: I fumbled around for a remark , and got out this one : `` I ca n't understand it at all .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 23]: If I had never seen General Grant I doubt if I would do that even to get a sight of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 9]: With a slight emphasis on the last word .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 13]: Their blank faces showed that they wondered where the parallel came in .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 11]: Then they said , blankly : `` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 7]: He is only a President . ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 20]: It is doubtless a fact that a prince is a permanent interest , an interest not subject to deterioration .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 73]: The general who was never defeated , the general who never held a council of war , the only general who ever commanded a connected battle-front twelve hundred miles long , the smith who welded together the broken parts of a great republic and re-established it where it is quite likely to outlast all the monarchies present and to come , was really a person of no serious consequence to these people .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 81]: To them , with their training , my General was only a man , after all , while their Prince was clearly much more than that -- a being of a wholly unsimilar construction and constitution , and being of no more blood and kinship with men than are the serene eternal lights of the firmament with the poor dull tallow candles of commerce that sputter and die and leave nothing behind but a pinch of ashes and a stink .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 10]: I saw the last act of `` Tannhauser . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 85]: I sat in the gloom and the deep stillness , waiting -- one minute , two minutes , I do not know exactly how long -- then the soft music of the hidden orchestra began to breathe its rich , long sighs out from under the distant stage , and by and by the drop-curtain parted in the middle and was drawn softly aside , disclosing the twilighted wood and a wayside shrine , with a white-robed girl praying and a man standing near .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 56]: Presently that noble chorus of men 's voices was heard approaching , and from that moment until the closing of the curtain it was music , just music -- music to make one drunk with pleasure , music to make one take scrip and staff and beg his way round the globe to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 25]: To such as are intending to come here in the Wagner season next year I wish to say , bring your dinner-pail with you .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 12]: If you do , you will never cease to be thankful .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 20]: If you do not , you will find it a hard fight to save yourself from famishing in Bayreuth .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 16]: Bayreuth is merely a large village , and has no very large hotels or eating-houses .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 11]: The principal inns are the Golden Anchor and the Sun .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 27]: At either of these places you can get an excellent meal -- no , I mean you can go there and see other people get it .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 7]: There is no charge for this .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 21]: The town is littered with restaurants , but they are small and bad , and they are overdriven with custom .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 20]: You must secure a table hours beforehand , and often when you arrive you will find somebody occupying it .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 6]: We have had this experience .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 21]: We have had a daily scramble for life ; and when I say we , I include shoals of people .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 30]: I have the impression that the only people who do not have to scramble are the veterans -- the disciples who have been here before and know the ropes .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 21]: I think they arrive about a week before the first opera , and engage all the tables for the season .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 40]: My tribe had tried all kinds of places -- some outside of the town , a mile or two -- and have captured only nibblings and odds and ends , never in any instance a complete and satisfying meal .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 2]: Digestible ?
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 5]: No , the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 25]: These odds and ends are going to serve as souvenirs of Bayreuth , and in that regard their value is not to be overestimated .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 38]: Photographs fade , bric-a-brac gets lost , busts of Wagner get broken , but once you absorb a Bayreuth-restaurant meal it is your possession and your property until the time comes to embalm the rest of you .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 18]: Some of these pilgrims here become , in effect , cabinets ; cabinets of souvenirs of Bayreuth .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 27]: It is believed among scientists that you could examine the crop of a dead Bayreuth pilgrim anywhere in the earth and tell where he came from .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 6]: But I like this ballast .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 41]: I think a `` Hermitage '' scrap-up at eight in the evening , when all the famine-breeders have been there and laid in their mementoes and gone , is the quietest thing you can lay on your keelson except gravel .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 2]: THURSDAY .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 37]: -- They keep two teams of singers in stock for the chief roles , and one of these is composed of the most renowned artists in the world , with Materna and Alvary in the lead .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 35]: I suppose a double team is necessary ; doubtless a single team would die of exhaustion in a week , for all the plays last from four in the afternoon till ten at night .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 27]: Nearly all the labor falls upon the half-dozen head singers , and apparently they are required to furnish all the noise they can for the money .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 23]: If they feel a soft , whispery , mysterious feeling they are required to open out and let the public know it .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 42]: Operas are given only on Sundays , Mondays , Wednesdays , and Thursdays , with three days of ostensible rest per week , and two teams to do the four operas ; but the ostensible rest is devoted largely to rehearsing .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 22]: It is said that the off days are devoted to rehearsing from some time in the morning till ten at night .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 6]: Are there two orchestras also ?
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 18]: It is quite likely , since there are one hundred and ten names in the orchestra list .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 10]: Yesterday the opera was `` Tristan and Isolde . ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 38]: I have seen all sorts of audiences -- at theaters , operas , concerts , lectures , sermons , funerals -- but none which was twin to the Wagner audience of Bayreuth for fixed and reverential attention .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 21]: Absolute attention and petrified retention to the end of an act of the attitude assumed at the beginning of it .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 13]: You detect no movement in the solid mass of heads and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 14]: You seem to sit with the dead in the gloom of a tomb .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 92]: You know that they are being stirred to their profoundest depths ; that there are times when they want to rise and wave handkerchiefs and shout their approbation , and times when tears are running down their faces , and it would be a relief to free their pent emotions in sobs or screams ; yet you hear not one utterance till the curtain swings together and the closing strains have slowly faded out and died ; then the dead rise with one impulse and shake the building with their applause .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 19]: Every seat is full in the first act ; there is not a vacant one in the last .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 23]: If a man would be conspicuous , let him come here and retire from the house in the midst of an act .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 6]: It would make him celebrated .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 56]: This audience reminds me of nothing I have ever seen and of nothing I have read about except the city in the Arabian tale where all the inhabitants have been turned to brass and the traveler finds them after centuries mute , motionless , and still retaining the attitudes which they last knew in life .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 19]: Here the Wagner audience dress as they please , and sit in the dark and worship in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 36]: At the Metropolitan in New York they sit in a glare , and wear their showiest harness ; they hum airs , they squeak fans , they titter , and they gabble all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 24]: In some of the boxes the conversation and laughter are so loud as to divide the attention of the house with the stage .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 36]: In large measure the Metropolitan is a show-case for rich fashionables who are not trained in Wagnerian music and have no reverence for it , but who like to promote art and show their clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 56]: Can that be an agreeable atmosphere to persons in whom this music produces a sort of divine ecstasy and to whom its creator is a very deity , his stage a temple , the works of his brain and hands consecrated things , and the partaking of them with eye and ear a sacred solemnity ?
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 4]: Manifestly , no .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 22]: Then , perhaps the temporary expatriation , the tedious traversing of seas and continents , the pilgrimage to Bayreuth stands explained .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 10]: These devotees would worship in an atmosphere of devotion .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 18]: It is only here that they can find it without fleck or blemish or any worldly pollution .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 35]: In this remote village there are no sights to see , there is no newspaper to intrude the worries of the distant world , there is nothing going on , it is always Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 62]: The pilgrim wends to his temple out of town , sits out his moving service , returns to his bed with his heart and soul and his body exhausted by long hours of tremendous emotion , and he is in no fit condition to do anything but to lie torpid and slowly gather back life and strength for the next service .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 45]: This opera of `` Tristan and Isolde '' last night broke the hearts of all witnesses who were of the faith , and I know of some who have heard of many who could not sleep after it , but cried the night away .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 8]: I feel strongly out of place here .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 52]: Sometimes I feel like the sane person in a community of the mad ; sometimes I feel like the one blind man where all others see ; the one groping savage in the college of the learned , and always , during service , I feel like a heretic in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 25]: But by no means do I ever overlook or minify the fact that this is one of the most extraordinary experiences of my life .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 9]: I have never seen anything like this before .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 15]: I have never seen anything so great and fine and real as this devotion .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 2]: FRIDAY .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 10]: -- Yesterday 's opera was `` Parsifal '' again .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 32]: The others went and they show marked advance in appreciation ; but I went hunting for relics and reminders of the Margravine Wilhelmina , she of the imperishable `` Memoirs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 34]: I am properly grateful to her for her -LRB- unconscious -RRB- satire upon monarchy and nobility , and therefore nothing which her hand touched or her eye looked upon is indifferent to me .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 15]: I am her pilgrim ; the rest of this multitude here are Wagner 's .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 2]: TUESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 23]: -- I have seen my last two operas ; my season is ended , and we cross over into Bohemia this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 43]: I was supposing that my musical regeneration was accomplished and perfected , because I enjoyed both of these operas , singing and all , and , moreover , one of them was `` Parsifal , '' but the experts have disenchanted me .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 6]: They say : `` Singing !
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 26]: That was n't singing ; that was the wailing , screeching of third-rate obscurities , palmed off on us in the interest of economy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 25]: Well , I ought to have recognized the sign -- the old , sure sign that has never failed me in matters of art .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 14]: Whenever I enjoy anything in art it means that it is mighty poor .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 24]: The private knowledge of this fact has saved me from going to pieces with enthusiasm in front of many and many a chromo .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 30]: However , my base instinct does bring me profit sometimes ; I was the only man out of thirty-two hundred who got his money back on those two operas .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 26]: WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS Is it true that the sun of a man 's mentality touches noon at forty and then begins to wane toward setting ?
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 8]: Doctor Osler is charged with saying so .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 18]: Maybe he said it , maybe he did n't ; I do n't know which it is .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 18]: But if he said it , I can point him to a case which proves his rule .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 9]: Proves it by being an exception to it .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 8]: To this place I nominate Mr. Howells .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 10]: I read his VENETIAN DAYS about forty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 28]: I compare it with his paper on Machiavelli in a late number of HARPER , and I can not find that his English has suffered any impairment .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 15]: For forty years his English has been to me a continual delight and astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 40]: In the sustained exhibition of certain great qualities -- clearness , compression , verbal exactness , and unforced and seemingly unconscious felicity of phrasing -- he is , in my belief , without his peer in the English-writing world .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 2]: SUSTAINED .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 8]: I entrench myself behind that protecting word .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 46]: There are others who exhibit those great qualities as greatly as he does , but only by intervaled distributions of rich moonlight , with stretches of veiled and dimmer landscape between ; whereas Howells 's moon sails cloudless skies all night and all the nights .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 15]: In the matter of verbal exactness Mr. Howells has no superior , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 21]: He seems to be almost always able to find that elusive and shifty grain of gold , the RIGHT WORD .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 18]: Others have to put up with approximations , more or less frequently ; he has better luck .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 49]: To me , the others are miners working with the gold-pan -- of necessity some of the gold washes over and escapes ; whereas , in my fancy , he is quicksilver raiding down a riffle -- no grain of the metal stands much chance of eluding him .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 65]: A powerful agent is the right word : it lights the reader 's way and makes it plain ; a close approximation to it will answer , and much traveling is done in a well-enough fashion by its help , but we do not welcome it and applaud it and rejoice in it as we do when THE right one blazes out on us .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 56]: Whenever we come upon one of those intensely right words in a book or a newspaper the resulting effect is physical as well as spiritual , and electrically prompt : it tingles exquisitely around through the walls of the mouth and tastes as tart and crisp and good as the autumn-butter that creams the sumac-berry .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 26]: One has no time to examine the word and vote upon its rank and standing , the automatic recognition of its supremacy is so immediate .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 42]: There is a plenty of acceptable literature which deals largely in approximations , but it may be likened to a fine landscape seen through the rain ; the right word would dismiss the rain , then you would see it better .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 10]: It does n't rain when Howells is at work .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 14]: And where does he get the easy and effortless flow of his speech ?
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 7]: and its cadenced and undulating rhythm ?
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 22]: and its architectural felicities of construction , its graces of expression , its pemmican quality of compression , and all that ?
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 7]: Born to him , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 34]: All in shining good order in the beginning , all extraordinary ; and all just as shining , just as extraordinary today , after forty years of diligent wear and tear and use .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 44]: He passed his fortieth year long and long ago ; but I think his English of today -- his perfect English , I wish to say -- can throw down the glove before his English of that antique time and not be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 25]: I will got back to the paper on Machiavelli now , and ask the reader to examine this passage from it which I append .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 22]: I do not mean examine it in a bird 's - eye way ; I mean search it , study it .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 9]: And , of course , read it aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 68]: I may be wrong , still it is my conviction that one can not get out of finely wrought literature all that is in it by reading it mutely : Mr. Dyer is rather of the opinion , first luminously suggested by Macaulay , that Machiavelli was in earnest , but must not be judged as a political moralist of our time and race would be judged .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 47]: He thinks that Machiavelli was in earnest , as none but an idealist can be , and he is the first to imagine him an idealist immersed in realities , who involuntarily transmutes the events under his eye into something like the visionary issues of reverie .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 34]: The Machiavelli whom he depicts does not cease to be politically a republican and socially a just man because he holds up an atrocious despot like Caesar Borgia as a mirror for rulers .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 24]: What Machiavelli beheld round him in Italy was a civic disorder in which there was oppression without statecraft , and revolt without patriotism .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 44]: When a miscreant like Borgia appeared upon the scene and reduced both tyrants and rebels to an apparent quiescence , he might very well seem to such a dreamer the savior of society whom a certain sort of dreamers are always looking for .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 30]: Machiavelli was no less honest when he honored the diabolical force than Carlyle was when at different times he extolled the strong man who destroys liberty in creating order .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 43]: But Carlyle has only just ceased to be mistaken for a reformer , while it is still Machiavelli 's hard fate to be so trammeled in his material that his name stands for whatever is most malevolent and perfidious in human nature .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 85]: You see how easy and flowing it is ; how unvexed by ruggednesses , clumsinesses , broken meters ; how simple and -- so far as you or I can make out -- unstudied ; how clear , how limpid , how understandable , how unconfused by cross-currents , eddies , undertows ; how seemingly unadorned , yet is all adornment , like the lily-of-the-valley ; and how compressed , how compact , without a complacency-signal hung out anywhere to call attention to it .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 9]: There are twenty-three lines in the quoted passage .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 22]: After reading it several times aloud , one perceives that a good deal of matter is crowded into that small space .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 9]: I think it is a model of compactness .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 38]: When I take its materials apart and work them over and put them together in my way , I find I can not crowd the result back into the same hole , there not being room enough .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 31]: I find it a case of a woman packing a man 's trunk : he can get the things out , but he ca n't ever get them back again .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 28]: The proffered paragraph is a just and fair sample ; the rest of the article is as compact as it is ; there are no waste words .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 34]: The sample is just in other ways : limpid , fluent , graceful , and rhythmical as it is , it holds no superiority in these respects over the rest of the essay .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 26]: Also , the choice phrasing noticeable in the sample is not lonely ; there is a plenty of its kin distributed through the other paragraphs .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 46]: This is claiming much when that kin must face the challenge of a phrase like the one in the middle sentence : `` an idealist immersed in realities who involuntarily transmutes the events under his eye into something like the visionary issues of reverie . ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 57]: With a hundred words to do it with , the literary artisan could catch that airy thought and tie it down and reduce it to a concrete condition , visible , substantial , understandable and all right , like a cabbage ; but the artist does it with twenty , and the result is a flower .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 80]: The quoted phrase , like a thousand others that have come from the same source , has the quality of certain scraps of verse which take hold of us and stay in our memories , we do not understand why , at first : all the words being the right words , none of them is conspicuous , and so they all seem inconspicuous , therefore we wonder what it is about them that makes their message take hold .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 33]: The mossy marbles rest On the lips that he has prest In their bloom , And the names he loved to hear Have been carved for many a year On the tomb .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 17]: It is like a dreamy strain of moving music , with no sharp notes in it .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 15]: The words are all `` right '' words , and all the same size .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 8]: We do not notice it at first .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 19]: We get the effect , it goes straight home to us , but we do not know why .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 24]: It is when the right words are conspicuous that they thunder : The glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome !
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 27]: When I got back from Howells old to Howells young I find him arranging and clustering English words well , but not any better than now .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 44]: He is not more felicitous in concreting abstractions now than he was in translating , then , the visions of the eyes of flesh into words that reproduced their forms and colors : In Venetian streets they give the fallen snow no rest .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 54]: It is at once shoveled into the canals by hundreds of half-naked FACCHINI ; and now in St. Mark 's Place the music of innumerable shovels smote upon my ear ; and I saw the shivering legion of poverty as it engaged the elements in a struggle for the possession of the Piazza .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 42]: But the snow continued to fall , and through the twilight of the descending flakes all this toil and encountered looked like that weary kind of effort in dreams , when the most determined industry seems only to renew the task .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 28]: The lofty crest of the bell-tower was hidden in the folds of falling snow , and I could no longer see the golden angel upon its summit .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 60]: But looked at across the Piazza , the beautiful outline of St. Mark 's Church was perfectly penciled in the air , and the shifting threads of the snowfall were woven into a spell of novel enchantment around the structure that always seemed to me too exquisite in its fantastic loveliness to be anything but the creation of magic .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 50]: The tender snow had compassionated the beautiful edifice for all the wrongs of time , and so hid the stains and ugliness of decay that it looked as if just from the hand of the builder -- or , better said , just from the brain of the architect .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 58]: There was marvelous freshness in the colors of the mosaics in the great arches of the facade , and all that gracious harmony into which the temple rises , or marble scrolls and leafy exuberance airily supporting the statues of the saints , was a hundred times etherealized by the purity and whiteness of the drifting flakes .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 91]: The snow lay lightly on the golden gloves that tremble like peacocks-crests above the vast domes , and plumed them with softest white ; it robed the saints in ermine ; and it danced over all its works , as if exulting in its beauty -- beauty which filled me with subtle , selfish yearning to keep such evanescent loveliness for the little-while-longer of my whole life , and with despair to think that even the poor lifeless shadow of it could never be fairly reflected in picture or poem .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 55]: Through the wavering snowfall , the Saint Theodore upon one of the granite pillars of the Piazzetta did not show so grim as his wont is , and the winged lion on the other might have been a winged lamb , so gentle and mild he looked by the tender light of the storm .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 68]: The towers of the island churches loomed faint and far away in the dimness ; the sailors in the rigging of the ships that lay in the Basin wrought like phantoms among the shrouds ; the gondolas stole in and out of the opaque distance more noiselessly and dreamily than ever ; and a silence , almost palpable , lay upon the mutest city in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 84]: The spirit of Venice is there : of a city where Age and Decay , fagged with distributing damage and repulsiveness among the other cities of the planet in accordance with the policy and business of their profession , come for rest and play between seasons , and treat themselves to the luxury and relaxation of sinking the shop and inventing and squandering charms all about , instead of abolishing such as they find , as it their habit when not on vacation .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 82]: In the working season they do business in Boston sometimes , and a character in THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY takes accurate note of pathetic effects wrought by them upon the aspects of a street of once dignified and elegant homes whose occupants have moved away and left them a prey to neglect and gradual ruin and progressive degradation ; a descent which reaches bottom at last , when the street becomes a roost for humble professionals of the faith-cure and fortune-telling sort .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 14]: What a queer , melancholy house , what a queer , melancholy street !
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 30]: I do n't think I was ever in a street before when quite so many professional ladies , with English surnames , preferred Madam to Mrs. on their door-plates .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 17]: And the poor old place has such a desperately conscious air of going to the deuce .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 33]: Every house seems to wince as you go by , and button itself up to the chin for fear you should find out it had no shirt on -- so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 46]: I do n't know what 's the reason , but these material tokens of a social decay afflict me terribly ; a tipsy woman is n't dreadfuler than a haggard old house , that 's once been a home , in a street like this .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 35]: Mr. Howells 's pictures are not mere stiff , hard , accurate photographs ; they are photographs with feeling in them , and sentiment , photographs taken in a dream , one might say .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 33]: As concerns his humor , I will not try to say anything , yet I would try , if I had the words that might approximately reach up to its high place .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 57]: I do not think any one else can play with humorous fancies so gracefully and delicately and deliciously as he does , nor has so many to play with , nor can come so near making them look as if they were doing the playing themselves and he was not aware that they were at it .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 15]: For they are unobtrusive , and quiet in their ways , and well conducted .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 43]: His is a humor which flows softly all around about and over and through the mesh of the page , pervasive , refreshing , health-giving , and makes no more show and no more noise than does the circulation of the blood .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 14]: There is another thing which is contentingly noticeable in Mr. Howells 's books .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 58]: That is his `` stage directions '' -- those artifices which authors employ to throw a kind of human naturalness around a scene and a conversation , and help the reader to see the one and get at meanings in the other which might not be perceived if entrusted unexplained to the bare words of the talk .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 59]: Some authors overdo the stage directions , they elaborate them quite beyond necessity ; they spend so much time and take up so much room in telling us how a person said a thing and how he looked and acted when he said it that we get tired and vexed and wish he had n't said it all .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 21]: Other authors ' directions are brief enough , but it is seldom that the brevity contains either wit or information .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 39]: Writers of this school go in rags , in the matter of state directions ; the majority of them having nothing in stock but a cigar , a laugh , a blush , and a bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 12]: In their poverty they work these sorry things to the bone .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 16]: They say : '' ... replied Alfred , flipping the ash from his cigar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 12]: -LRB- This explains nothing ; it only wastes space . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 9]: ... responded Richard , with a laugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 12]: -LRB- There was nothing to laugh about ; there never is .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 67]: The writer puts it in from habit -- automatically ; he is paying no attention to his work ; or he would see that there is nothing to laugh at ; often , when a remark is unusually and poignantly flat and silly , he tries to deceive the reader by enlarging the stage direction and making Richard break into `` frenzies of uncontrollable laughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 8]: This makes the reader sad . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 7]: ... murmured Gladys , blushing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 11]: -LRB- This poor old shop-worn blush is a tiresome thing .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 22]: We get so we would rather Gladys would fall out of the book and break her neck than do it again .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 10]: She is always doing it , and usually irrelevantly .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 22]: Whenever it is her turn to murmur she hangs out her blush ; it is the only thing she 's got .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 16]: In a little while we hate her , just as we do Richard . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 9]: ... repeated Evelyn , bursting into tears . ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 11]: -LRB- This kind keep a book damp all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 9]: They ca n't say a thing without crying .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 34]: They cry so much about nothing that by and by when they have something to cry ABOUT they have gone dry ; they sob , and fetch nothing ; we are not moved .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 6]: We are only glad . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 31]: They gavel me , these stale and overworked stage directions , these carbon films that got burnt out long ago and can not now carry any faintest thread of light .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 46]: It would be well if they could be relieved from duty and flung out in the literary back yard to rot and disappear along with the discarded and forgotten `` steeds '' and `` halidomes '' and similar stage-properties once so dear to our grandfathers .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 25]: But I am friendly to Mr. Howells 's stage directions ; more friendly to them than to any one else 's , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 31]: They are done with a competent and discriminating art , and are faithful to the requirements of a state direction 's proper and lawful office , which is to inform .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 45]: Sometimes they convey a scene and its conditions so well that I believe I could see the scene and get the spirit and meaning of the accompanying dialogue if some one would read merely the stage directions to me and leave out the talk .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 32]: For instance , a scene like this , from THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY : '' ... and she laid her arms with a beseeching gesture on her father 's shoulder . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 13]: ... she answered , following his gesture with a glance . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 9]: ... she said , laughing nervously . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 16]: ... she asked , turning swiftly upon him that strange , searching glance . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 8]: ... she answered , vaguely . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 7]: ... she reluctantly admitted . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 20]: ... but her voice died wearily away , and she stood looking into his face with puzzled entreaty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 22]: Mr. Howells does not repeat his forms , and does not need to ; he can invent fresh ones without limit .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 36]: It is mainly the repetition over and over again , by the third-rates , of worn and commonplace and juiceless forms that makes their novels such a weariness and vexation to us , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 42]: We do not mind one or two deliveries of their wares , but as we turn the pages over and keep on meeting them we presently get tired of them and wish they would do other things for a change . ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 13]: ... replied Alfred , flipping the ash from his cigar . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 10]: ... responded Richard , with a laugh . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 8]: ... murmured Gladys , blushing . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 10]: ... repeated Evelyn , bursting into tears . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 14]: ... replied the Earl , flipping the ash from his cigar . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 11]: ... responded the undertaker , with a laugh . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 9]: ... murmured the chambermaid , blushing . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 11]: ... repeated the burglar , bursting into tears . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 14]: ... replied the conductor , flipping the ash from his cigar . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 10]: ... responded Arkwright , with a laugh . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 11]: ... murmured the chief of police , blushing . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 10]: ... repeated the house-cat , bursting into tears . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 15]: And so on and so on ; till at last it ceases to excite .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 27]: I always notice stage directions , because they fret me and keep me trying to get out of their way , just as the automobiles do .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 16]: At first ; then by and by they become monotonous and I get run over .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 21]: Mr. Howells has done much work , and the spirit of it is as beautiful as the make of it .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 42]: I have held him in admiration and affection so many years that I know by the number of those years that he is old now ; but his heart is n't , nor his pen ; and years do not count .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 15]: Let him have plenty of them ; there is profit in them for us .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 23]: ENGLISH AS SHE IS TAUGHT In the appendix to Croker 's Boswell 's Johnson one finds this anecdote : CATO 'S SOLILOQUY .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 29]: -- One day Mrs. Gastrel set a little girl to repeat to him -LRB- Dr. Samuel Johnson -RRB- Cato 's Soliloquy , which she went through very correctly .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 22]: The Doctor , after a pause , asked the child : `` What was to bring Cato to an end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 7]: She said it was a knife .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 12]: `` No , my dear , it was not so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 11]: `` My aunt Polly said it was a knife . ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 20]: `` Why , Aunt Polly 's knife MAY DO , but it was a DAGGER , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 20]: He then asked her the meaning of `` bane and antidote , '' which she was unable to give .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 22]: Mrs. Gastrel said : `` You can not expect so young a child to know the meaning of such words . ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 17]: He then said : `` My dear , how many pence are there in SIXPENCE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 14]: `` I can not tell , sir , '' was the half-terrified reply .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 47]: On this , addressing himself to Mrs. Gastrel , he said : `` Now , my dear lady , can anything be more ridiculous than to teach a child Cato 's Soliloquy , who does not know how many pence there are in a sixpence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 45]: In a lecture before the Royal Geographical Society Professor Ravenstein quoted the following list of frantic questions , and said that they had been asked in an examination : Mention all names of places in the world derived from Julius Caesar or Augustus Caesar .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 16]: Where are the following rivers : Pisuerga , Sakaria , Guadalete , Jalon , Mulde ?
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 27]: All you know of the following : Machacha , Pilmo , Schebulos , Crivoscia , Basces , Mancikert , Taxhem , Citeaux , Meloria , Zutphen .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 8]: The highest peaks of the Karakorum range .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 7]: The number of universities in Prussia .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 14]: Why are the tops of mountains continually covered with snow -LRB- sic -RRB- ?
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 22]: Name the length and breadth of the streams of lava which issued from the Skaptar Jokul in the eruption of 1783 .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 10]: That list would oversize nearly anybody 's geographical knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 26]: Is n't it reasonably possible that in our schools many of the questions in all studies are several miles ahead of where the pupil is ?
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 23]: -- that he is set to struggle with things that are ludicrously beyond his present reach , hopelessly beyond his present strength ?
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 22]: This remark in passing , and by way of text ; now I come to what I was going to say .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 11]: I have just now fallen upon a darling literary curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 34]: It is a little book , a manuscript compilation , and the compiler sent it to me with the request that I say whether I think it ought to be published or not .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 54]: I said , Yes ; but as I slowly grow wise I briskly grow cautious ; and so , now that the publication is imminent , it has seemed to me that I should feel more comfortable if I could divide up this responsibility with the public by adding them to the court .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 32]: Therefore I will print some extracts from the book , in the hope that they may make converts to my judgment that the volume has merit which entitles it to publication .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 5]: As to its character .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 50]: Every one has sampled `` English as She is Spoke '' and `` English as She is Wrote '' ; this little volume furnishes us an instructive array of examples of `` English as She is Taught '' -- in the public schools of -- well , this country .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 34]: The collection is made by a teacher in those schools , and all the examples in it are genuine ; none of them have been tampered with , or doctored in any way .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 67]: From time to time , during several years , whenever a pupil has delivered himself of anything peculiarly quaint or toothsome in the course of his recitations , this teacher and her associates have privately set that thing down in a memorandum-book ; strictly following the original , as to grammar , construction , spelling , and all ; and the result is this literary curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 29]: The contents of the book consist mainly of answers given by the boys and girls to questions , said answers being given sometimes verbally , sometimes in writing .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 14]: The subjects touched upon are fifteen in number : I. Etymology ; II .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 4]: Grammar ; III .

Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 4]: Oratory ; XV .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 2]: Metaphysics .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 26]: You perceive that the poor little young idea has taken a shot at a good many kinds of game in the course of the book .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 5]: Now as to results .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 8]: Here are some quaint definitions of words .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 36]: It will be noticed that in all of these instances the sound of the word , or the look of it on paper , has misled the child : ABORIGINES , a system of mountains .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 9]: ALIAS , a good man in the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 7]: AMENABLE , anything that is mean .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 8]: AMMONIA , the food of the gods .

Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 11]: PUBLICAN , a man who does his prayers in public .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 7]: TENACIOUS , ten acres of land .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 48]: Here is one where the phrase `` publicans and sinners '' has got mixed up in the child 's mind with politics , and the result is a definition which takes one in a sudden and unexpected way : REPUBLICAN , a sinner mentioned in the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 8]: Also in Democratic newspapers now and then .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 22]: Here are two where the mistake has resulted from sound assisted by remote fact : PLAGIARIST , a writer of plays .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 10]: DEMAGOGUE , a vessel containing beer and other liquids .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 47]: I can not quite make out what it was that misled the pupil in the following instances ; it would not seem to have been the sound of the word , nor the look of it in print : ASPHYXIA , a grumbling , fussy temper .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 17]: QUARTERNIONS , a bird with a flat beak and no bill , living in New Zealand .

Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 48]: In the following sentences the little people have some information to convey , every time ; but in my case they fail to connect : the light always went out on the keystone word : The coercion of some things is remarkable ; as bread and molasses .

Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 28]: The last is a curiously plausible sentence ; one seems to know what it means , and yet he knows all the time that he does n't .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 46]: Here is an odd -LRB- but entirely proper -RRB- use of a word , and a most sudden descent from a lofty philosophical altitude to a very practical and homely illustration : We should endeavor to avoid extremes -- like those of wasps and bees .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 56]: And here -- with `` zoological '' and `` geological '' in his mind , but not ready to his tongue -- the small scholar has innocently gone and let out a couple of secrets which ought never to have been divulged in any circumstances : There are a good many donkeys in theological gardens .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 11]: Some of the best fossils are found in theological gardens .

Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 12]: Adverbs should always be used as adjectives and adjectives as adverbs .

Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 48]: The following is a brave attempt at a solution , but it failed to liquify : When they are going to say some prose or poetry before they say the poetry or prose they must put a semicolon just after the introduction of the prose or poetry .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 11]: The chapter on `` Mathematics '' is full of fruit .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 24]: From it I take a few samples -- mainly in an unripe state : A straight line is any distance between two places .

Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 32]: The questions do not appear to have applied the microscope to the subject , as did those quoted by Professor Ravenstein ; still , they proved plenty difficult enough without that .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 41]: These pupils did not hunt with a microscope , they hunted with a shot-gun ; this is shown by the crippled condition of the game they brought in : America is divided into the Passiffic slope and the Mississippi valey .

Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 52]: The chapter headed `` Analysis '' shows us that the pupils in our public schools are not merely loaded up with those showy facts about geography , mathematics , and so on , and left in that incomplete state ; no , there 's machinery for clarifying and expanding their minds .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 45]: They are required to take poems and analyze them , dig out their common sense , reduce them to statistics , and reproduce them in a luminous prose translation which shall tell you at a glance what the poet was trying to get at .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 5]: One sample will do .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 70]: Here is a stanza from `` The Lady of the Lake , '' followed by the pupil 's impressive explanation of it : Alone , but with unbated zeal , The horseman plied with scourge and steel ; For jaded now and spent with toil , Embossed with foam and dark with soil , While every gasp with sobs he drew , The laboring stag strained full in view .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 67]: The man who rode on the horse performed the whip and an instrument made of steel alone with strong ardor not diminishing , for , being tired from the time passed with hard labor overworked with anger and ignorant with weariness , while every breath for labor he drew with cries full or sorrow , the young deer made imperfect who worked hard filtered in sight .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 13]: I see , now , that I never understood that poem before .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 38]: I have had glimpses of its meaning , it moments when I was not as ignorant with weariness as usual , but this is the first time the whole spacious idea of it ever filtered in sight .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 32]: If I were a public-school pupil I would put those other studies aside and stick to analysis ; for , after all , it is the thing to spread your mind .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 14]: We come now to historical matters , historical remains , one might say .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 27]: As one turns the pages he is impressed with the depth to which one date has been driven into the American child 's head -- 1492 .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 12]: The date is there , and it is there to stay .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 15]: And it is always at hand , always deliverable at a moment 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 8]: But the Fact that belongs with it ?
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 6]: That is quite another matter .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 17]: Only the date itself is familiar and sure : its vast Fact has failed of lodgment .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 35]: It would appear that whenever you ask a public-school pupil when a thing -- anything , no matter what -- happened , and he is in doubt , he always rips out his 1492 .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 19]: He applies it to everything , from the landing of the ark to the introduction of the horse-car .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 41]: Well , after all , it is our first date , and so it is right enough to honor it , and pay the public schools to teach our children to honor it : George Washington was born in 1492 .

Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 17]: It would be as useful to cram him with brickbats ; they would at least stay .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 41]: In a town in the interior of New York , a few years ago , a gentleman set forth a mathematical problem and proposed to give a prize to every public-school pupil who should furnish the correct solution of it .

Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 33]: The problem was not a very difficult one for pupils of their mathematical rank and standing , yet they all failed -- by a hair -- through one trifling mistake or another .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 39]: Some searching questions were asked , when it turned out that these lads were as glib as parrots with the `` rules , '' but could not reason out a single rule or explain the principle underlying it .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 11]: Their memories had been stocked , but not their understandings .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 12]: It was a case of brickbat culture , pure and simple .

Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 19]: Thir is one thing I have not told and that is they al-ways now their lessons bettern boys .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 48]: From Mr. Edward Channing 's recent article in SCIENCE : The marked difference between the books now being produced by French , English , and American travelers , on the one hand , and German explorers , on the other , is too great to escape attention .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 37]: That difference is due entirely to the fact that in school and university the German is taught , in the first place to see , and in the second place to understand what he does see .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 29]: A SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET -LRB- This article , written during the autumn of 1899 , was about the last writing done by Mark Twain on any impersonal subject . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 35]: I have had a kindly feeling , a friendly feeling , a cousinly feeling toward Simplified Spelling , from the beginning of the movement three years ago , but nothing more inflamed than that .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 43]: It seemed to me to merely propose to substitute one inadequacy for another ; a sort of patching and plugging poor old dental relics with cement and gold and porcelain paste ; what was really needed was a new set of teeth .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 9]: That is to say , a new ALPHABET .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 11]: The heart of our trouble is with our foolish alphabet .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 14]: It does n't know how to spell , and ca n't be taught .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 14]: In this it is like all other alphabets except one -- the phonographic .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 10]: This is the only competent alphabet in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 12]: It can spell and correctly pronounce any word in our language .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 21]: That admirable alphabet , that brilliant alphabet , that inspired alphabet , can be learned in an hour or two .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 23]: In a week the student can learn to write it with some little facility , and to read it with considerable ease .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 35]: I know , for I saw it tried in a public school in Nevada forty-five years ago , and was so impressed by the incident that it has remained in my memory ever since .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 18]: I wish we could adopt it in place of our present written -LRB- and printed -RRB- character .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 38]: I mean SIMPLY the alphabet ; simply the consonants and the vowels -- I do n't mean any REDUCTIONS or abbreviations of them , such as the shorthand writer uses in order to get compression and speed .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 9]: No , I would SPELL EVERY WORD OUT .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 16]: I will insert the alphabet here as I find it in Burnz 's PHONIC SHORTHAND .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 16]: -LRB- Figure 1 -RRB- It is arranged on the basis of Isaac Pitman 's PHONOGRAPHY .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 11]: Isaac Pitman was the originator and father of scientific phonography .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 7]: It is used throughout the globe .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 6]: It was a memorable invention .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 8]: He made it public seventy-three years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 22]: The firm of Isaac Pitman & Sons , New York , still exists , and they continue the master 's work .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 5]: What should we gain ?
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 24]: First of all , we could spell DEFINITELY -- and correctly -- any word you please , just by the SOUND of it .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 10]: We ca n't do that with our present alphabet .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 11]: For instance , take a simple , every-day word PHTHISIS .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 27]: If we tried to spell it by the sound of it , we should make it TYSIS , and be laughed at by every educated person .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 12]: Secondly , we should gain in REDUCTION OF LABOR in writing .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 21]: Simplified Spelling makes valuable reductions in the case of several hundred words , but the new spelling must be LEARNED .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 18]: You ca n't spell them by the sound ; you must get them out of the book .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 37]: But even if we knew the simplified form for every word in the language , the phonographic alphabet would still beat the Simplified Speller `` hands down '' in the important matter of economy of labor .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 13]: I will illustrate : PRESENT FORM : through , laugh , highland .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 9]: SIMPLIFIED FORM : thru , laff , hyland .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 23]: PHONOGRAPHIC FORM : -LRB- Figure 2 -RRB- To write the word `` through , '' the pen has to make twenty-one strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 20]: To write the word `` thru , '' then pen has to make twelve strokes -- a good saving .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 19]: To write that same word with the phonographic alphabet , the pen has to make only THREE strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 16]: To write the word `` laugh , '' the pen has to make FOURTEEN strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 25]: To write `` laff , '' the pen has to make the SAME NUMBER of strokes -- no labor is saved to the penman .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 19]: To write the same word with the phonographic alphabet , the pen has to make only THREE strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 16]: To write the word `` highland , '' the pen has to make twenty-two strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 14]: To write `` hyland , '' the pen has to make eighteen strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 18]: To write that word with the phonographic alphabet , the pen has to make only FIVE strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 21]: -LRB- Figure 3 -RRB- To write the words `` phonographic alphabet , '' the pen has to make fifty-three strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 15]: To write `` fonografic alfabet , '' the pen has to make fifty strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 11]: To the penman , the saving in labor is insignificant .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 22]: To write that word -LRB- with vowels -RRB- with the phonographic alphabet , the pen has to make only SEVENTEEN strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 8]: Without the vowels , only THIRTEEN strokes .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 13]: -LRB- Figure 4 -RRB- The vowels are hardly necessary , this time .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 37]: We make five pen-strokes in writing an m. Thus : -LRB- Figure 5 -RRB- a stroke down ; a stroke up ; a second stroke down ; a second stroke up ; a final stroke down .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 4]: Total , five .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 45]: The phonographic alphabet accomplishes the m with a single stroke -- a curve , like a parenthesis that has come home drunk and has fallen face down right at the front door where everybody that goes along will see him and say , Alas !
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 46]: When our written m is not the end of a word , but is otherwise located , it has to be connected with the next letter , and that requires another pen-stroke , making six in all , before you get rid of that m .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 12]: But never mind about the connecting strokes -- let them go .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 24]: Without counting them , the twenty-six letters of our alphabet consumed about eighty pen-strokes for their construction -- about three pen-strokes per letter .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 12]: It is THREE TIMES THE NUMBER required by the phonographic alphabet .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 9]: It requires but ONE stroke for each letter .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 22]: My writing-gait is -- well , I do n't know what it is , but I will time myself and see .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 9]: Result : it is twenty-four words per minute .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 10]: I do n't mean composing ; I mean COPYING .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 7]: There is n't any definite composing-gait .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 14]: Very well , my copying-gait is 1,440 words per hour -- say 1,500 .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 18]: If I could use the phonographic character with facility I could do the 1,500 in twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 22]: I could do nine hours ' copying in three hours ; I could do three years ' copying in one year .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 23]: Also , if I had a typewriting machine with the phonographic alphabet on it -- oh , the miracles I could do !
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 10]: I am not pretending to write that character well .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 17]: I have never had a lesson , and I am copying the letters from the book .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 64]: But I can accomplish my desire , at any rate , which is , to make the reader get a good and clear idea of the advantage it would be to us if we could discard our present alphabet and put this better one in its place -- using it in books , newspapers , with the typewriter , and with the pen .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 9]: -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB- -- MAN DOG HORSE .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 12]: I think it is graceful and would look comely in print .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 15]: And consider -- once more , I beg -- what a labor-saver it is !
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 19]: Ten pen-strokes with the one system to convey those three words above , and thirty-three by the other !
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 15]: -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB- I mean , in SOME ways , not in all .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 30]: I suppose I might go so far as to say in most ways , and be within the facts , but never mind ; let it go at SOME .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 41]: One of the ways in which it exercises this birthright is -- as I think -- continuing to use our laughable alphabet these seventy-three years while there was a rational one at hand , to be had for the taking .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 49]: It has taken five hundred years to simplify some of Chaucer 's rotten spelling -- if I may be allowed to use to frank a term as that -- and it will take five hundred years more to get our exasperating new Simplified Corruptions accepted and running smoothly .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 40]: And we sha 'n' t be any better off then than we are now ; for in that day we shall still have the privilege the Simplifiers are exercising now : ANYBODY can change the spelling that wants to .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 15]: BUT YOU CA N'T CHANGE THE PHONOGRAPHIC SPELLING ; THERE IS N'T ANY WAY .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 7]: It will always follow the SOUND .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 16]: If you want to change the spelling , you have to change the sound first .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 32]: Mind , I myself am a Simplified Speller ; I belong to that unhappy guild that is patiently and hopefully trying to reform our drunken old alphabet by reducing his whiskey .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 7]: Well , it will improve him .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 21]: When they get through and have reformed him all they can by their system he will be only HALF drunk .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 10]: Above that condition their system can never lift him .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 34]: There is no competent , and lasting , and real reform for him but to take away his whiskey entirely , and fill up his jug with Pitman 's wholesome and undiseased alphabet .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 21]: One great drawback to Simplified Spelling is , that in print a simplified word looks so like the very nation !
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 18]: and when you bunch a whole squadron of the Simplified together the spectacle is very nearly unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 41]: The da ma ov koars kum when the publik ma be expektd to get rekonsyled to the bezair asspekt of the Simplified Kombynashuns , but -- if I may be allowed the expression -- is it worth the wasted time ?
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 32]: -LRB- Figure 7 -RRB- To see our letters put together in ways to which we are not accustomed offends the eye , and also takes the EXPRESSION out of the words .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 16]: La on , Makduf , and damd be he hoo furst krys hold , enuf !
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 11]: It does n't thrill you as it used to do .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 11]: The simplifications have sucked the thrill all out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 42]: But a written character with which we are NOT ACQUAINTED does not offend us -- Greek , Hebrew , Russian , Arabic , and the others -- they have an interesting look , and we see beauty in them , too .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 10]: And this is true of hieroglyphics , as well .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 17]: There is something pleasant and engaging about the mathematical signs when we do not understand them .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 34]: The mystery hidden in these things has a fascination for us : we ca n't come across a printed page of shorthand without being impressed by it and wishing we could read it .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 25]: Very well , what I am offering for acceptance and adopting is not shorthand , but longhand , written with the SHORTHAND ALPHABET UNREACHED .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 21]: You can write three times as many words in a minute with it as you can write with our alphabet .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 13]: And so , in a way , it IS properly a shorthand .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 16]: It has a pleasant look , too ; a beguiling look , an inviting look .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 36]: I will write something in it , in my rude and untaught way : -LRB- Figure 8 -RRB- Even when _ I _ do it it comes out prettier than it does in Simplified Spelling .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 26]: Yes , and in the Simplified it costs one hundred and twenty-three pen-strokes to write it , whereas in the phonographic it costs only twenty-nine .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 11]: -LRB- Figure 9 -RRB- is probably -LRB- Figure 10 -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 7]: Let us hope so , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 63]: AS CONCERNS INTERPRETING THE DEITY I This line of hieroglyphics was for fourteen years the despair of all the scholars who labored over the mysteries of the Rosetta stone : -LRB- Figure 1 -RRB- After five years of study Champollion translated it thus : Therefore let the worship of Epiphanes be maintained in all the temples , this upon pain of death .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 12]: That was the twenty-forth translation that had been furnished by scholars .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 6]: For a time it stood .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 6]: But only for a time .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 17]: Then doubts began to assail it and undermine it , and the scholars resumed their labors .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 42]: Three years of patient work produced eleven new translations ; among them , this , by Grunfeldt , was received with considerable favor : The horse of Epiphanes shall be maintained at the public expense ; this upon pain of death .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 44]: But the following rendering , by Gospodin , was received by the learned world with yet greater favor : The priest shall explain the wisdom of Epiphanes to all these people , and these shall listen with reverence , upon pain of death .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 21]: Seven years followed , in which twenty-one fresh and widely varying renderings were scored -- none of them quite convincing .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 40]: But now , at last , came Rawlinson , the youngest of all the scholars , with a translation which was immediately and universally recognized as being the correct version , and his name became famous in a day .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 51]: So famous , indeed , that even the children were familiar with it ; and such a noise did the achievement itself make that not even the noise of the monumental political event of that same year -- the flight from Elba -- was able to smother it to silence .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 49]: Rawlinson 's version reads as follows : Therefore , walk not away from the wisdom of Epiphanes , but turn and follow it ; so shall it conduct thee to the temple 's peace , and soften for thee the sorrows of life and the pains of death .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 42]: Here is another difficult text : -LRB- Figure 2 -RRB- It is demotic -- a style of Egyptian writing and a phase of the language which has perished from the knowledge of all men twenty-five hundred years before the Christian era .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 20]: Our red Indians have left many records , in the form of pictures , upon our crags and boulders .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 49]: It has taken our most gifted and painstaking students two centuries to get at the meanings hidden in these pictures ; yet there are still two little lines of hieroglyphics among the figures grouped upon the Dighton Rocks which they have not succeeds in interpreting to their satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 19]: These : -LRB- Figure 3 -RRB- The suggested solutions are practically innumerable ; they would fill a book .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 28]: Thus we have infinite trouble in solving man-made mysteries ; it is only when we set out to discover the secret of God that our difficulties disappear .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 5]: It was always so .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 47]: In antique Roman times it was the custom of the Deity to try to conceal His intentions in the entrails of birds , and this was patiently and hopefully continued century after century , although the attempted concealment never succeeded , in a single recorded instance .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 16]: The augurs could read entrails as easily as a modern child can read coarse print .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 15]: Roman history is full of the marvels of interpretation which these extraordinary men performed .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 13]: These strange and wonderful achievements move our awe and compel our admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 12]: Those men could pierce to the marrow of a mystery instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 21]: If the Rosetta-stone idea had been introduced it would have defeated them , but entrails had no embarrassments for them .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 11]: Entrails have gone out , now -- entrails and dreams .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 17]: It was at last found out that as hiding-places for the divine intentions they were inadequate .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 38]: A part of the wall of Valletri in former times been struck with thunder , the response of the soothsayers was , that a native of that town would some time or other arrive at supreme power .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 8]: -- BOHN 'S SUETONIUS , p. 138 .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 7]: `` Some time or other . ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 50]: It looks indefinite , but no matter , it happened , all the same ; one needed only to wait , and be patient , and keep watch , then he would find out that the thunder-stroke had Caesar Augustus in mind , and had come to give notice .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 5]: There were other advance-advertisements .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 25]: One of them appeared just before Caesar Augustus was born , and was most poetic and touching and romantic in its feelings and aspects .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 5]: It was a dream .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 41]: It was dreamed by Caesar Augustus 's mother , and interpreted at the usual rates : Atia , before her delivery , dreamed that her bowels stretched to the stars and expanded through the whole circuit of heaven and earth .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 6]: -- SUETONIUS , p. 139 .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 41]: That was in the augur 's line , and furnished him no difficulties , but it would have taken Rawlinson and Champollion fourteen years to make sure of what it meant , because they would have been surprised and dizzy .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 27]: It would have been too late to be valuable , then , and the bill for service would have been barred by the statute of limitation .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 29]: In those old Roman days a gentleman 's education was not complete until he had taken a theological course at the seminary and learned how to translate entrails .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 9]: Caesar Augustus 's education received this final polish .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 35]: All through his life , whenever he had poultry on the menu he saved the interiors and kept himself informed of the Deity 's plans by exercising upon those interiors the arts of augury .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 24]: In his first consulship , while he was observing the auguries , twelve vultures presented themselves , as they had done to Romulus .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 47]: And when he offered sacrifice , the livers of all the victims were folded inward in the lower part ; a circumstance which was regarded by those present who had skill in things of that nature , as an indubitable prognostic of great and wonderful fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 6]: -- SUETONIUS , p. 141 .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 24]: `` Indubitable '' is a strong word , but no doubt it was justified , if the livers were really turned that way .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 54]: In those days chicken livers were strangely and delicately sensitive to coming events , no matter how far off they might be ; and they could never keep still , but would curl and squirm like that , particularly when vultures came and showed interest in that approaching great event and in breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 31]: II We may now skip eleven hundred and thirty or forty years , which brings us down to enlightened Christian times and the troubled days of King Stephen of England .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 22]: The augur has had his day and has been long ago forgotten ; the priest had fallen heir to his trade .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 27]: King Henry is dead ; Stephen , that bold and outrageous person , comes flying over from Normandy to steal the throne from Henry 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 23]: He accomplished his crime , and Henry of Huntington , a priest of high degree , mourns over it in his Chronicle .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 38]: The Archbishop of Canterbury consecrated Stephen : `` wherefore the Lord visited the Archbishop with the same judgment which he had inflicted upon him who struck Jeremiah the great priest : he died with a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 19]: Stephen 's was the greater offense , but Stephen could wait ; not so the Archbishop , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 34]: The kingdom was a prey to intestine wars ; slaughter , fire , and rapine spread ruin throughout the land ; cries of distress , horror , and woe rose in every quarter .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 9]: That was the result of Stephen 's crime .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 8]: These unspeakable conditions continued during nineteen years .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 16]: Then Stephen died as comfortably as any man ever did , and was honorably buried .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 23]: It makes one pity the poor Archbishop , and with that he , too , could have been let off as leniently .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 22]: How did Henry of Huntington know that the Archbishop was sent to his grave by judgment of God for consecrating Stephen ?
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 5]: He does not explain .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 57]: Neither does he explain why Stephen was awarded a pleasanter death than he was entitled to , while the aged King Henry , his predecessor , who had ruled England thirty-five years to the people 's strongly worded satisfaction , was condemned to close his life in circumstances most distinctly unpleasant , inconvenient , and disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 14]: His was probably the most uninspiring funeral that is set down in history .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 11]: There is not a detail about it that is attractive .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 33]: It seems to have been just the funeral for Stephen , and even at this far-distant day it is matter of just regret that by an indiscretion the wrong man got it .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 43]: Whenever God punishes a man , Henry of Huntington knows why it was done , and tells us ; and his pen is eloquent with admiration ; but when a man has earned punishment , and escapes , he does not explain .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 12]: He is evidently puzzled , but he does not say anything .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 24]: I think it is often apparent that he is pained by these discrepancies , but loyally tries his best not to show it .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 25]: When he can not praise , he delivers himself of a silence so marked that a suspicious person could mistake it for suppressed criticism .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 23]: However , he has plenty of opportunities to feel contented with the way things go -- his book is full of them .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 20]: King David of Scotland ... under color of religion caused his followers to deal most barbarously with the English .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 54]: They ripped open women , tossed children on the points of spears , butchered priests at the altars , and , cutting off the heads from the images on crucifixes , placed them on the bodies of the slain , while in exchange they fixed on the crucifixes the heads of their victims .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 35]: Wherever the Scots came , there was the same scene of horror and cruelty : women shrieking , old men lamenting , amid the groans of the dying and the despair of the living .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 7]: But the English got the victory .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 24]: Then the chief of the men of Lothian fell , pierced by an arrow , and all his followers were put to flight .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 16]: For the Almighty was offended at them and their strength was rent like a cobweb .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 6]: Offended at them for what ?
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 6]: For committing those fearful butcheries ?
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 18]: No , for that was the common custom on both sides , and not open to criticism .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 14]: Then was it for doing the butcheries `` under cover of religion '' ?
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 22]: No , that was not it ; religious feeling was often expressed in that fervent way all through those old centuries .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 31]: The truth is , He was not offended at `` them '' at all ; He was only offended at their king , who had been false to an oath .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 18]: Then why did not He put the punishment upon the king instead of upon `` them '' ?
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 6]: It is a difficult question .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 28]: One can see by the Chronicle that the `` judgments '' fell rather customarily upon the wrong person , but Henry of Huntington does not explain why .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 60]: Here is one that went true ; the chronicler 's satisfaction in it is not hidden : In the month of August , Providence displayed its justice in a remarkable manner ; for two of the nobles who had converted monasteries into fortifications , expelling the monks , their sin being the same , met with a similar punishment .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 11]: Robert Marmion was one , Godfrey de Mandeville the other .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 33]: Robert Marmion , issuing forth against the enemy , was slain under the walls of the monastery , being the only one who fell , though he was surrounded by his troops .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 10]: Dying excommunicated , he became subject to death everlasting .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 22]: In like manner Earl Godfrey was singled out among his followers , and shot with an arrow by a common foot-soldier .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 20]: He made light of the wound , but he died of it in a few days , under excommunication .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 13]: See here the like judgment of God , memorable through all ages !
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 33]: The exaltation jars upon me ; not because of the death of the men , for they deserved that , but because it is death eternal , in white-hot fire and flame .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 6]: It makes my flesh crawl .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 37]: I have not known more than three men , or perhaps four , in my whole lifetime , whom I would rejoice to see writhing in those fires for even a year , let alone forever .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 19]: I believe I would relent before the year was up , and get them out if I could .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 53]: I think that in the long run , if a man 's wife and babies , who had not harmed me , should come crying and pleading , I could n't stand it ; I know I should forgive him and let him go , even if he had violated a monastery .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 32]: Henry of Huntington has been watching Godfrey and Marmion for nearly seven hundred and fifty years , now , but I could n't do it , I know I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 21]: I am soft and gentle in my nature , and I should have forgiven them seventy-and-seven times , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 24]: And I think God has ; but this is only an opinion , and not authoritative , like Henry of Huntington 's interpretations .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 18]: I could learn to interpret , but I have never tried ; I get so little time .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 22]: All through his book Henry exhibits his familiarity with the intentions of God , and with the reasons for his intentions .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 58]: Sometimes -- very often , in fact -- the act follows the intention after such a wide interval of time that one wonders how Henry could fit one act out of a hundred to one intention out of a hundred and get the thing right every time when there was such abundant choice among acts and intentions .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 42]: Sometimes a man offends the Deity with a crime , and is punished for it thirty years later ; meantime he was committed a million other crimes : no matter , Henry can pick out the one that brought the worms .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 15]: Worms were generally used in those days for the slaying of particularly wicked people .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 16]: This has gone out , now , but in old times it was a favorite .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 10]: It always indicated a case of `` wrath . ''
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 57]: For instance : ... the just God avenging Robert Fitzhilderbrand 's perfidy , a worm grew in his vitals , which gradually gnawing its way through his intestines fattened on the abandoned man till , tortured with excruciating sufferings and venting himself in bitter moans , he was by a fitting punishment brought to his end .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 6]: -- -LRB- P. 400 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 28]: It was probably an alligator , but we can not tell ; we only know it was a particular breed , and only used to convey wrath .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 14]: Some authorities think it was an ichthyosaurus , but there is much doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 21]: However , one thing we do know ; and that is that that worm had been due years and years .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 44]: Robert F. had violated a monastery once ; he had committed unprintable crimes since , and they had been permitted -- under disapproval -- but the ravishment of the monastery had not been forgotten nor forgiven , and the worm came at last .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 11]: Why were these reforms put off in this strange way ?
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 8]: What was to be gained by it ?
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 15]: Did Henry of Huntington really know his facts , or was he only guessing ?
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 18]: Sometimes I am half persuaded that he is only a guesser , and not a good one .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 18]: The divine wisdom must surely be of the better quality than he makes it out to be .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 51]: Five hundred years before Henry 's time some forecasts of the Lord 's purposes were furnished by a pope , who perceived , by certain perfectly trustworthy signs furnished by the Deity for the information of His familiars , that the end of the world was ... about to come .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 72]: But as this end of the world draws near many things are at hand which have not before happened , as changes in the air , terrible signs in the heavens , tempests out of the common order of the seasons , wars , famines , pestilences , earthquakes in various places ; all which will not happen in our days , but after our days all will come to pass .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 33]: Still , the end was so near that these signs were `` sent before that we may be careful for our souls and be found prepared to meet the impending judgment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 7]: That was thirteen hundred years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 13]: This is really no improvement on the work of the Roman augurs .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 11]: CONCERNING TOBACCO As concerns tobacco , there are many superstitions .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 23]: And the chiefest is this -- that there is a STANDARD governing the matter , whereas there is nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 28]: Each man 's own preference is the only standard for him , the only one which he can accept , the only one which can command him .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 30]: A congress of all the tobacco-lovers in the world could not elect a standard which would be binding upon you or me , or would even much influence us .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 14]: The next superstition is that a man has a standard of his own .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 4]: He has n't .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 10]: He thinks he has , but he has n't .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 26]: He thinks he can tell what he regards as a good cigar from what he regards as a bad one -- but he ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 14]: He goes by the brand , yet imagines he goes by the flavor .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 24]: One may palm off the worst counterfeit upon him ; if it bears his brand he will smoke it contentedly and never suspect .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 24]: Children of twenty-five , who have seven years experience , try to tell me what is a good cigar and what is n't .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 24]: Me , who never learned to smoke , but always smoked ; me , who came into the world asking for a light .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 14]: No one can tell me what is a good cigar -- for me .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 6]: I am the only judge .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 16]: People who claim to know say that I smoke the worst cigars in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 12]: They bring their own cigars when they come to my house .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 37]: They betray an unmanly terror when I offer them a cigar ; they tell lies and hurry away to meet engagements which they have not made when they are threatened with the hospitalities of my box .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 17]: Now then , observe what superstition , assisted by a man 's reputation , can do .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 12]: I was to have twelve personal friends to supper one night .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 20]: One of them was as notorious for costly and elegant cigars as I was for cheap and devilish ones .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 37]: I called at his house and when no one was looking borrowed a double handful of his very choicest ; cigars which cost him forty cents apiece and bore red-and-gold labels in sign of their nobility .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 38]: I removed the labels and put the cigars into a box with my favorite brand on it -- a brand which those people all knew , and which cowed them as men are cowed by an epidemic .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 91]: They took these cigars when offered at the end of the supper , and lit them and sternly struggled with them -- in dreary silence , for hilarity died when the fell brand came into view and started around -- but their fortitude held for a short time only ; then they made excuses and filed out , treading on one another 's heels with indecent eagerness ; and in the morning when I went out to observe results the cigars lay all between the front door and the gate .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 21]: All except one -- that one lay in the plate of the man from whom I had cabbaged the lot .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 10]: One or two whiffs was all he could stand .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 21]: He told me afterward that some day I would get shot for giving people that kind of cigars to smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 8]: Am I certain of my own standard ?
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 43]: Perfectly ; yes , absolutely -- unless somebody fools me by putting my brand on some other kind of cigar ; for no doubt I am like the rest , and know my cigar by the brand instead of by the flavor .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 17]: However , my standard is a pretty wide one and covers a good deal of territory .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 28]: To me , almost any cigar is good that nobody else will smoke , and to me almost all cigars are bad that other people consider good .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 11]: Nearly any cigar will do me , except a Havana .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 29]: People think they hurt my feelings when then come to my house with their life preservers on -- I mean , with their own cigars in their pockets .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 15]: It is an error ; I take care of myself in a similar way .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 161]: When I go into danger -- that is , into rich people 's houses , where , in the nature of things , they will have high-tariff cigars , red-and-gilt girded and nested in a rosewood box along with a damp sponge , cigars which develop a dismal black ash and burn down the side and smell , and will grow hot to the fingers , and will go on growing hotter and hotter , and go on smelling more and more infamously and unendurably the deeper the fire tunnels down inside below the thimbleful of honest tobacco that is in the front end , the furnisher of it praising it all the time and telling you how much the deadly thing cost -- yes , when I go into that sort of peril I carry my own defense along ; I carry my own brand -- twenty-seven cents a barrel -- and I live to see my family again .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 67]: I may seem to light his red-gartered cigar , but that is only for courtesy 's sake ; I smuggle it into my pocket for the poor , of whom I know many , and light one of my own ; and while he praises it I join in , but when he says it cost forty-five cents I say nothing , for I know better .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 33]: However , to say true , my tastes are so catholic that I have never seen any cigars that I really could not smoke , except those that cost a dollar apiece .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 20]: I have examined those and know that they are made of dog-hair , and not good dog-hair at that .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 30]: I have a thoroughly satisfactory time in Europe , for all over the Continent one finds cigars which not even the most hardened newsboys in New York would smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 18]: I brought cigars with me , the last time ; I will not do that any more .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 14]: In Italy , as in France , the Government is the only cigar-peddler .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 30]: Italy has three or four domestic brands : the Minghetti , the Trabuco , the Virginia , and a very coarse one which is a modification of the Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 32]: The Minghettis are large and comely , and cost three dollars and sixty cents a hundred ; I can smoke a hundred in seven days and enjoy every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 14]: The Trabucos suit me , too ; I do n't remember the price .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 17]: But one has to learn to like the Virginia , nobody is born friendly to it .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 14]: It looks like a rat-tail file , but smokes better , some think .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 36]: It has a straw through it ; you pull this out , and it leaves a flue , otherwise there would be no draught , not even as much as there is to a nail .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 7]: Some prefer a nail at first .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 38]: However , I like all the French , Swiss , German , and Italian domestic cigars , and have never cared to inquire what they are made of ; and nobody would know , anyhow , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 12]: There is even a brand of European smoking-tobacco that I like .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 10]: It is a brand used by the Italian peasants .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 13]: It is loose and dry and black , and looks like tea-grounds .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 27]: When the fire is applied it expands , and climbs up and towers above the pipe , and presently tumbles off inside of one 's vest .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 12]: The tobacco itself is cheap , but it raises the insurance .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 19]: It is as I remarked in the beginning -- the taste for tobacco is a matter of superstition .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 9]: There are no standards -- no real standards .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 27]: Each man 's preference is the only standard for him , the only one which he can accept , the only one which can command him .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 12]: THE BEE It was Maeterlinck who introduced me to the bee .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 12]: I mean , in the psychical and in the poetical way .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 8]: I had had a business introduction earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 8]: It was when I was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 21]: It is strange that I should remember a formality like that so long ; it must be nearly sixty years .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 10]: Bee scientists always speak of the bee as she .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 12]: It is because all the important bees are of that sex .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 33]: In the hive there is one married bee , called the queen ; she has fifty thousand children ; of these , about one hundred are sons ; the rest are daughters .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 21]: Some of the daughters are young maids , some are old maids , and all are virgins and remain so .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 21]: Every spring the queen comes out of the hive and flies away with one of her sons and marries him .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 25]: The honeymoon lasts only an hour or two ; then the queen divorces her husband and returns home competent to lay two million eggs .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 52]: This will be enough to last the year , but not more than enough , because hundreds of bees are drowned every day , and other hundreds are eaten by birds , and it is the queen 's business to keep the population up to standard -- say , fifty thousand .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 30]: She must always have that many children on hand and efficient during the busy season , which is summer , or winter would catch the community short of food .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 62]: She lays from two thousand to three thousand eggs a day , according to the demand ; and she must exercise judgment , and not lay more than are needed in a slim flower-harvest , nor fewer than are required in a prodigal one , or the board of directors will dethrone her and elect a queen that has more sense .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 32]: There are always a few royal heirs in stock and ready to take her place -- ready and more than anxious to do it , although she is their own mother .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 16]: These girls are kept by themselves , and are regally fed and tended from birth .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 20]: No other bees get such fine food as they get , or live such a high and luxurious life .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 14]: By consequence they are larger and longer and sleeker than their working sisters .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 20]: And they have a curved sting , shaped like a scimitar , while the others have a straight one .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 17]: A common bee will sting any one or anybody , but a royalty stings royalties only .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 28]: A common bee will sting and kill another common bee , for cause , but when it is necessary to kill the queen other ways are employed .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 42]: When a queen has grown old and slack and does not lay eggs enough one of her royal daughters is allowed to come to attack her , the rest of the bees looking on at the duel and seeing fair play .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 9]: It is a duel with the curved stings .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 78]: If one of the fighters gets hard pressed and gives it up and runs , she is brought back and must try again -- once , maybe twice ; then , if she runs yet once more for her life , judicial death is her portion ; her children pack themselves into a ball around her person and hold her in that compact grip two or three days , until she starves to death or is suffocated .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 18]: Meantime the victor bee is receiving royal honors and performing the one royal function -- laying eggs .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 30]: As regards the ethics of the judicial assassination of the queen , that is a matter of politics , and will be discussed later , in its proper place .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 110]: During substantially the whole of her short life of five or six years the queen lives in Egyptian darkness and stately seclusion of the royal apartments , with none about her but plebeian servants , who give her empty lip-affection in place of the love which her heart hungers for ; who spy upon her in the interest of her waiting heirs , and report and exaggerate her defects and deficiencies to them ; who fawn upon her and flatter her to her face and slander her behind her back ; who grovel before her in the day of her power and forsake her in her age and weakness .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 134]: There she sits , friendless , upon her throne through the long night of her life , cut off from the consoling sympathies and sweet companionship and loving endearments which she craves , by the gilded barriers of her awful rank ; a forlorn exile in her own house and home , weary object of formal ceremonies and machine-made worship , winged child of the sun , native to the free air and the blue skies and the flowery fields , doomed by the splendid accident of her birth to trade this priceless heritage for a black captivity , a tinsel grandeur , and a loveless life , with shame and insult at the end and a cruel death -- and condemned by the human instinct in her to hold the bargain valuable !
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 29]: Huber , Lubbock , Maeterlinck -- in fact , all the great authorities -- are agreed in denying that the bee is a member of the human family .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 19]: I do not know why they have done this , but I think it is from dishonest motives .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 32]: Why , the innumerable facts brought to light by their own painstaking and exhaustive experiments prove that if there is a master fool in the world , it is the bee .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 6]: That seems to settle it .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 9]: But that is the way of the scientist .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 52]: He will spend thirty years in building up a mountain range of facts with the intent to prove a certain theory ; then he is so happy in his achievement that as a rule he overlooks the main chief fact of all -- that his accumulation proves an entirely different thing .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 32]: When you point out this miscarriage to him he does not answer your letters ; when you call to convince him , the servant prevaricates and you do not get in .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 21]: Scientists have odious manners , except when you prop up their theory ; then you can borrow money of them .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 36]: To be strictly fair , I will concede that now and then one of them will answer your letter , but when they do they avoid the issue -- you can not pin them down .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 22]: When I discovered that the bee was human I wrote about it to all those scientists whom I have just mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 14]: For evasions , I have seen nothing to equal the answers I got .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 16]: After the queen , the personage next in importance in the hive is the virgin .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 21]: The virgins are fifty thousand or one hundred thousand in number , and they are the workers , the laborers .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 17]: No work is done , in the hive or out of it , save by them .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 27]: The males do not work , the queen does no work , unless laying eggs is work , but it does not seem so to me .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 21]: There are only two million of them , anyway , and all of five months to finish the contract in .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 24]: The distribution of work in a hive is as cleverly and elaborately specialized as it is in a vast American machine-shop or factory .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 43]: A bee that has been trained to one of the many and various industries of the concern does n't know how to exercise any other , and would be offended if asked to take a hand in anything outside of her profession .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 27]: She is as human as a cook ; and if you should ask the cook to wait on the table , you know what will happen .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 16]: Cooks will play the piano if you like , but they draw the line there .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 19]: In my time I have asked a cook to chop wood , and I know about these things .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 26]: Even the hired girl has her frontiers ; true , they are vague , they are ill-defined , even flexible , but they are there .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 12]: This is not conjecture ; it is founded on the absolute .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 5]: And then the butler .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 9]: You ask the butler to wash the dog .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 22]: It is just as I say ; there is much to be learned in these ways , without going to books .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 18]: Books are very well , but books do not cover the whole domain of esthetic human culture .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 17]: Pride of profession is one of the boniest bones in existence , if not the boniest .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 9]: Without doubt it is so in the hive .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 22]: TAMING THE BICYCLE In the early eighties Mark Twain learned to ride one of the old high-wheel bicycles of that period .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 16]: He wrote an account of his experience , but did not offer it for publication .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 27]: The form of bicycle he rode long ago became antiquated , but in the humor of his pleasantry is a quality which does not grow old .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 17]: A. B. P. I I thought the matter over , and concluded I could do it .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 16]: So I went down a bought a barrel of Pond 's Extract and a bicycle .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 10]: The Expert came home with me to instruct me .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 17]: We chose the back yard , for the sake of privacy , and went to work .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 31]: Mine was not a full-grown bicycle , but only a colt -- a fifty-inch , with the pedals shortened up to forty-eight -- and skittish , like any other colt .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 31]: The Expert explained the thing 's points briefly , then he got on its back and rode around a little , to show me how easy it was to do .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 23]: He said that the dismounting was perhaps the hardest thing to learn , and so we would leave that to the last .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 7]: But he was in error there .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 38]: He found , to his surprise and joy , that all that he needed to do was to get me on to the machine and stand out of the way ; I could get off , myself .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 15]: Although I was wholly inexperienced , I dismounted in the best time on record .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 33]: He was on that side , shoving up the machine ; we all came down with a crash , he at the bottom , I next , and the machine on top .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 14]: We examined the machine , but it was not in the least injured .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 5]: This was hardly believable .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 18]: Yet the Expert assured me that it was true ; in fact , the examination proved it .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 15]: I was partly to realize , then , how admirably these things are constructed .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 10]: We applied some Pond 's Extract , and resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 27]: The Expert got on the OTHER side to shove up this time , but I dismounted on that side ; so the result was as before .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 6]: The machine was not hurt .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 8]: We oiled ourselves again , and resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 21]: This time the Expert took up a sheltered position behind , but somehow or other we landed on him again .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 11]: He was full of admiration ; said it was abnormal .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 17]: She was all right , not a scratch on her , not a timber started anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 35]: I said it was wonderful , while we were greasing up , but he said that when I came to know these steel spider-webs I would realize that nothing but dynamite could cripple them .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 13]: Then he limped out to position , and we resumed once more .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 20]: This time the Expert took up the position of short-stop , and got a man to shove up behind .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 49]: We got up a handsome speed , and presently traversed a brick , and I went out over the top of the tiller and landed , head down , on the instructor 's back , and saw the machine fluttering in the air between me and the sun .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 21]: It was well it came down on us , for that broke the fall , and it was not injured .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 22]: Five days later I got out and was carried down to the hospital , and found the Expert doing pretty fairly .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 10]: In a few more days I was quite sound .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 13]: I attribute this to my prudence in always dismounting on something soft .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 14]: Some recommend a feather bed , but I think an Expert is better .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 13]: The Expert got out at last , brought four assistants with him .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 6]: It was a good idea .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 39]: These four held the graceful cobweb upright while I climbed into the saddle ; then they formed in column and marched on either side of me while the Expert pushed behind ; all hands assisted at the dismount .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 17]: The bicycle had what is called the `` wabbles , '' and had them very badly .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 27]: In order to keep my position , a good many things were required of me , and in every instance the thing required was against nature .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 48]: That is to say , that whatever the needed thing might be , my nature , habit , and breeding moved me to attempt it in one way , while some immutable and unsuspected law of physics required that it be done in just the other way .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 20]: I perceived by this how radically and grotesquely wrong had been the life-long education of my body and members .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 19]: They were steeped in ignorance ; they knew nothing -- nothing which it could profit them to know .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 40]: For instance , if I found myself falling to the right , I put the tiller hard down the other way , by a quite natural impulse , and so violated a law , and kept on going down .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 22]: The law required the opposite thing -- the big wheel must be turned in the direction in which you are falling .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 13]: It is hard to believe this , when you are told it .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 19]: And not merely hard to believe it , but impossible ; it is opposed to all your notions .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 18]: And it is just as hard to do it , after you do come to believe it .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 45]: Believing it , and knowing by the most convincing proof that it is true , does not help it : you ca n't any more DO it than you could before ; you can neither force nor persuade yourself to do it at first .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 11]: The intellect has to come to the front , now .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 16]: It has to teach the limbs to discard their old education and adopt the new .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 10]: The steps of one 's progress are distinctly marked .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 31]: At the end of each lesson he knows he has acquired something , and he also knows what that something is , and likewise that it will stay with him .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 48]: It is not like studying German , where you mull along , in a groping , uncertain way , for thirty years ; and at last , just as you think you 've got it , they spring the subjunctive on you , and there you are .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 31]: No -- and I see now , plainly enough , that the great pity about the German language is , that you ca n't fall off it and hurt yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 14]: There is nothing like that feature to make you attend strictly to business .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 29]: But I also see , by what I have learned of bicycling , that the right and only sure way to learn German is by the bicycling method .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 23]: That is to say , take a grip on one villainy of it at a time , leaving that one half learned .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 34]: When you have reached the point in bicycling where you can balance the machine tolerably fairly and propel it and steer it , then comes your next task -- how to mount it .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 32]: You do it in this way : you hop along behind it on your right foot , resting the other on the mounting-peg , and grasping the tiller with your hands .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 60]: At the word , you rise on the peg , stiffen your left leg , hang your other one around in the air in a general in indefinite way , lean your stomach against the rear of the saddle , and then fall off , maybe on one side , maybe on the other ; but you fall off .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 17]: You get up and do it again ; and once more ; and then several times .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 43]: By this time you have learned to keep your balance ; and also to steer without wrenching the tiller out by the roots -LRB- I say tiller because it IS a tiller ; `` handle-bar '' is a lamely descriptive phrase -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 56]: So you steer along , straight ahead , a little while , then you rise forward , with a steady strain , bringing your right leg , and then your body , into the saddle , catch your breath , fetch a violent hitch this way and then that , and down you go again .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 28]: But you have ceased to mind the going down by this time ; you are getting to light on one foot or the other with considerable certainty .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 11]: Six more attempts and six more falls make you perfect .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 51]: You land in the saddle comfortably , next time , and stay there -- that is , if you can be content to let your legs dangle , and leave the pedals alone a while ; but if you grab at once for the pedals , you are gone again .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 64]: You soon learn to wait a little and perfect your balance before reaching for the pedals ; then the mounting-art is acquired , is complete , and a little practice will make it simple and easy to you , though spectators ought to keep off a rod or two to one side , along at first , if you have nothing against them .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 18]: And now you come to the voluntary dismount ; you learned the other kind first of all .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 58]: It is quite easy to tell one how to do the voluntary dismount ; the words are few , the requirement simple , and apparently undifficult ; let your left pedal go down till your left leg is nearly straight , turn your wheel to the left , and get off as you would from a horse .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 12]: It certainly does sound exceedingly easy ; but it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 13]: I do n't know why it is n't but it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 28]: Try as you may , you do n't get down as you would from a horse , you get down as you would from a house afire .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 9]: You make a spectacle of yourself every time .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 16]: II During the eight days I took a daily lesson an hour and a half .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 17]: At the end of this twelve working-hours ' apprenticeship I was graduated -- in the rough .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 13]: I was pronounced competent to paddle my own bicycle without outside help .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 9]: It seems incredible , this celerity of acquirement .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 13]: It takes considerably longer than that to learn horseback-riding in the rough .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 28]: Now it is true that I could have learned without a teacher , but it would have been risky for me , because of my natural clumsiness .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 55]: The self-taught man seldom knows anything accurately , and he does not know a tenth as much as he could have known if he had worked under teachers ; and , besides , he brags , and is the means of fooling other thoughtless people into going and doing as he himself has done .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 26]: There are those who imagine that the unlucky accidents of life -- life 's `` experiences '' -- are in some way useful to us .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 8]: I wish I could find out how .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 10]: I never knew one of them to happen twice .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 15]: They always change off and swap around and catch you on your inexperienced side .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 66]: If personal experience can be worth anything as an education , it would n't seem likely that you could trip Methuselah ; and yet if that old person could come back here it is more that likely that one of the first things he would do would be to take hold of one of these electric wires and tie himself all up in a knot .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 26]: Now the surer thing and the wiser thing would be for him to ask somebody whether it was a good thing to take hold of .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 28]: But that would not suit him ; he would be one of the self-taught kind that go by experience ; he would want to examine for himself .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 65]: And he would find , for his instruction , that the coiled patriarch shuns the electric wire ; and it would be useful to him , too , and would leave his education in quite a complete and rounded-out condition , till he should come again , some day , and go to bouncing a dynamite-can around to find out what was in it .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 7]: But we wander from the point .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 15]: However , get a teacher ; it saves much time and Pond 's Extract .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 28]: Before taking final leave of me , my instructor inquired concerning my physical strength , and I was able to inform him that I had n't any .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 30]: He said that that was a defect which would make up-hill wheeling pretty difficult for me at first ; but he also said the bicycle would soon remove it .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 11]: The contrast between his muscles and mine was quite marked .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 17]: He wanted to test mine , so I offered my biceps -- which was my best .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 6]: It almost made him smile .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 44]: He said , `` It is pulpy , and soft , and yielding , and rounded ; it evades pressure , and glides from under the fingers ; in the dark a body might think it was an oyster in a rag . ''
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 42]: Perhaps this made me look grieved , for he added , briskly : `` Oh , that 's all right , you need n't worry about that ; in a little while you ca n't tell it from a petrified kidney .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 14]: Just go right along with your practice ; you 're all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 14]: Then he left me , and I started out alone to seek adventures .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 21]: You do n't really have to seek them -- that is nothing but a phrase -- they come to you .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 20]: I chose a reposeful Sabbath-day sort of a back street which was about thirty yards wide between the curbstones .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 27]: I knew it was not wide enough ; still , I thought that by keeping strict watch and wasting no space unnecessarily I could crowd through .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 33]: Of course I had trouble mounting the machine , entirely on my own responsibility , with no encouraging moral support from the outside , no sympathetic instructor to say , `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 29]: now you 're doing well -- good again -- do n't hurry -- there , now , you 're all right -- brace up , go ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 10]: In place of this I had some other support .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 18]: This was a boy , who was perched on a gate-post munching a hunk of maple sugar .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 8]: He was full of interest and comment .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 29]: The first time I failed and went down he said that if he was me he would dress up in pillows , that 's what he would do .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 19]: The next time I went down he advised me to go and learn to ride a tricycle first .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 18]: The third time I collapsed he said he did n't believe I could stay on a horse-car .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 30]: But the next time I succeeded , and got clumsily under way in a weaving , tottering , uncertain fashion , and occupying pretty much all of the street .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 30]: My slow and lumbering gait filled the boy to the chin with scorn , and he sung out , `` My , but do n't he rip along ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 19]: Then he got down from his post and loafed along the sidewalk , still observing and occasionally commenting .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 11]: Presently he dropped into my wake and followed along behind .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 44]: A little girl passed by , balancing a wash-board on her head , and giggled , and seemed about to make a remark , but the boy said , rebukingly , `` Let him alone , he 's going to a funeral . ''
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 36]: I have been familiar with that street for years , and had always supposed it was a dead level ; but it was not , as the bicycle now informed me , to my surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 32]: The bicycle , in the hands of a novice , is as alert and acute as a spirit-level in the detecting the delicate and vanishing shades of difference in these matters .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 25]: It notices a rise where your untrained eye would not observe that one existed ; it notices any decline which water will run down .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 15]: I was toiling up a slight rise , but was not aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 28]: It made me tug and pant and perspire ; and still , labor as I might , the machine came almost to a standstill every little while .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 13]: At such times the boy would say : `` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 10]: take a rest -- there ai n't no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 10]: They ca n't hold the funeral without YOU . ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 7]: Stones were a bother to me .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 14]: Even the smallest ones gave me a panic when I went over them .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 35]: I could hit any kind of a stone , no matter how small , if I tried to miss it ; and of course at first I could n't help trying to do that .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 5]: It is but natural .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 18]: It is part of the ass that is put in us all , for some inscrutable reason .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 22]: It was at the end of my course , at last , and it was necessary for me to round to .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 28]: This is not a pleasant thing , when you undertake it for the first time on your own responsibility , and neither is it likely to succeed .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 122]: Your confidence oozes away , you fill steadily up with nameless apprehensions , every fiber of you is tense with a watchful strain , you start a cautious and gradual curve , but your squirmy nerves are all full of electric anxieties , so the curve is quickly demoralized into a jerky and perilous zigzag ; then suddenly the nickel-clad horse takes the bit in its mouth and goes slanting for the curbstone , defying all prayers and all your powers to change its mind -- your heart stands still , your breath hangs fire , your legs forget to work , straight on you go , and there are but a couple of feet between you and the curb now .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 50]: And now is the desperate moment , the last chance to save yourself ; of course all your instructions fly out of your head , and you whirl your wheel AWAY from the curb instead of TOWARD it , and so you go sprawling on that granite-bound inhospitable shore .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 10]: That was my luck ; that was my experience .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 18]: I dragged myself out from under the indestructible bicycle and sat down on the curb to examine .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 7]: I started on the return trip .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 20]: It was now that I saw a farmer 's wagon poking along down toward me , loaded with cabbages .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 17]: If I needed anything to perfect the precariousness of my steering , it was just that .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 25]: The farmer was occupying the middle of the road with his wagon , leaving barely fourteen or fifteen yards of space on either side .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 32]: I could n't shout at him -- a beginner ca n't shout ; if he opens his mouth he is gone ; he must keep all his attention on his business .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 24]: But in this grisly emergency , the boy came to the rescue , and for once I had to be grateful to him .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 28]: He kept a sharp lookout on the swiftly varying impulses and inspirations of my bicycle , and shouted to the man accordingly : `` To the left !
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 14]: Turn to the left , or this jackass 'll run over you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 7]: The man started to do it .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 11]: `` No , to the right , to the right !
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 3]: Hold on !
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 5]: THAT wo n't do !
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 5]: -- to the left !
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 5]: -- to the right !
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 7]: -- to the LEFT -- right !
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 16]: left -- ri -- Stay where you ARE , or you 're a goner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 18]: And just then I caught the off horse in the starboard and went down in a pile .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 7]: I said , `` Hang it !
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 9]: Could n't you SEE I was coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 20]: `` Yes , I see you was coming , but I could n't tell which WAY you was coming .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 8]: Nobody could -- now , COULD they ?
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 10]: You could n't yourself -- now , COULD you ?
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 9]: So what could _ I _ do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 16]: There was something in that , and so I had the magnanimity to say so .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 14]: I said I was no doubt as much to blame as he was .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 20]: Within the next five days I achieved so much progress that the boy could n't keep up with me .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 20]: He had to go back to his gate-post , and content himself with watching me fall at long range .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 19]: There was a row of low stepping-stones across one end of the street , a measured yard apart .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 23]: Even after I got so I could steer pretty fairly I was so afraid of those stones that I always hit them .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 21]: They gave me the worst falls I ever got in that street , except those which I got from dogs .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 30]: I have seen it stated that no expert is quick enough to run over a dog ; that a dog is always able to skip out of his way .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 28]: I think that that may be true : but I think that the reason he could n't run over the dog was because he was trying to .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 10]: I did not try to run over any dog .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 10]: But I ran over every dog that came along .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 10]: I think it makes a great deal of difference .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 41]: If you try to run over the dog he knows how to calculate , but if you are trying to miss him he does not know how to calculate , and is liable to jump the wrong way every time .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 8]: It was always so in my experience .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 20]: Even when I could not hit a wagon I could hit a dog that came to see me practice .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 28]: They all liked to see me practice , and they all came , for there was very little going on in our neighborhood to entertain a dog .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 16]: It took time to learn to miss a dog , but I achieved even that .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 32]: I can steer as well as I want to , now , and I will catch that boy one of these days and run over HIM if he does n't reform .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 4]: Get a bicycle .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 10]: You will not regret it , if you live .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 4]: IS SHAKESPEARE DEAD ?
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 91]: -LRB- from My Autobiography -RRB- Scattered here and there through the stacks of unpublished manuscript which constitute this formidable Autobiography and Diary of mine , certain chapters will in some distant future be found which deal with `` Claimants '' -- claimants historically notorious : Satan , Claimant ; the Golden Calf , Claimant ; the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan , Claimant ; Louis XVII. , Claimant ; William Shakespeare , Claimant ; Arthur Orton , Claimant ; Mary Baker G. Eddy , Claimant -- and the rest of them .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 87]: Eminent Claimants , successful Claimants , defeated Claimants , royal Claimants , pleb Claimants , showy Claimants , shabby Claimants , revered Claimants , despised Claimants , twinkle star-like here and there and yonder through the mists of history and legend and tradition -- and , oh , all the darling tribe are clothed in mystery and romance , and we read about them with deep interest and discuss them with loving sympathy or with rancorous resentment , according to which side we hitch ourselves to .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 10]: It has always been so with the human race .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 34]: There was never a Claimant that could n't get a hearing , nor one that could n't accumulate a rapturous following , no matter how flimsy and apparently unauthentic his claim might be .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 95]: Arthur Orton 's claim that he was the lost Tichborne baronet come to life again was as flimsy as Mrs. Eddy 's that she wrote SCIENCE AND HEALTH from the direct dictation of the Deity ; yet in England nearly forty years ago Orton had a huge army of devotees and incorrigible adherents , many of whom remained stubbornly unconvinced after their fat god had been proven an impostor and jailed as a perjurer , and today Mrs. Eddy 's following is not only immense , but is daily augmenting in numbers and enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 23]: Orton had many fine and educated minds among his adherents , Mrs. Eddy has had the like among hers from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 15]: Her Church is as well equipped in those particulars as is any other Church .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 30]: Claimants can always count upon a following , it does n't matter who they are , nor what they claim , nor whether they come with documents or without .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 5]: It was always so .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 33]: Down out of the long-vanished past , across the abyss of the ages , if you listen , you can still hear the believing multitudes shouting for Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 45]: A friend has sent me a new book , from England -- THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM RESTATED -- well restated and closely reasoned ; and my fifty years ' interest in that matter -- asleep for the last three years -- is excited once more .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 26]: It is an interest which was born of Delia Bacon 's book -- away back in the ancient day -- 1857 , or maybe 1856 .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 40]: About a year later my pilot-master , Bixby , transferred me from his own steamboat to the PENNSYLVANIA , and placed me under the orders and instructions of George Ealer -- dead now , these many , many years .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 36]: I steered for him a good many months -- as was the humble duty of the pilot-apprentice : stood a daylight watch and spun the wheel under the severe superintendence and correction of the master .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 11]: He was a prime chess-player and an idolater of Shakespeare .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 22]: He would play chess with anybody ; even with me , and it cost his official dignity something to do that .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 31]: Also -- quite uninvited -- he would read Shakespeare to me ; not just casually , but by the hour , when it was his watch and I was steering .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 19]: He read well , but not profitably for me , because he constantly injected commands into the text .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 56]: That broke it all up , mixed it all up , tangled it all up -- to that degree , in fact , that if we were in a risky and difficult piece of river an ignorant person could n't have told , sometimes , which observations were Shakespeare 's and which were Ealer 's .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 12]: For instance : What man dare , _ I _ dare !
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 11]: Approach thou WHAT are you laying in the leads for ?
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 7]: what a hell of an idea !
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 13]: like the rugged ease her off a little , ease her off !
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 13]: rugged Russian bear , the armed rhinoceros or the THERE she goes !
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 6]: meet her , meet her !
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 16]: did n't you KNOW she 'd smell the reef if you crowded in like that ?
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 23]: Hyrcan tiger ; take any ship but that and my firm nerves she 'll be in the WOODS the first you know !
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 4]: stop he starboard !
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 7]: come ahead strong on the larboard !
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 4]: back the starboard !
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 47]: ... NOW then , you 're all right ; come ahead on the starboard ; straighten up and go ` long , never tremble : or be alive again , and dare me to the desert DAMNATION ca n't you keep away from that greasy water ?
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 4]: pull her down !
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 3]: snatch her !
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 4]: snatch her baldheaded !
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 15]: with thy sword ; if trembling I inhabit then , lay in the leads !
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 22]: -- no , only with the starboard one , leave the other alone , protest me the baby of a girl .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 4]: Hence horrible shadow !
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 24]: eight bells -- that watchman 's asleep again , I reckon , go down and call Brown yourself , unreal mockery , hence !
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 40]: He certainly was a good reader , and splendidly thrilling and stormy and tragic , but it was a damage to me , because I have never since been able to read Shakespeare in a calm and sane way .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 28]: I can not rid it of his explosive interlardings , they break in everywhere with their irrelevant , `` What in hell are you up to NOW !
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 4]: pull her down !
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 2]: more !
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 2]: MORE !
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 23]: -- there now , steady as you go , '' and the other disorganizing interruptions that were always leaping from his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 23]: When I read Shakespeare now I can hear them as plainly as I did in that long-departed time -- fifty-one years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 9]: I never regarded Ealer 's readings as educational .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 9]: Indeed , they were a detriment to me .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 27]: His contributions to the text seldom improved it , but barring that detail he was a good reader ; I can say that much for him .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 27]: He did not use the book , and did not need to ; he knew his Shakespeare as well as Euclid ever knew his multiplication table .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 18]: Did he have something to say -- this Shakespeare-adoring Mississippi pilot -- anent Delia Bacon 's book ?
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 36]: And he said it ; said it all the time , for months -- in the morning watch , the middle watch , and dog watch ; and probably kept it going in his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 45]: He bought the literature of the dispute as fast as it appeared , and we discussed it all through thirteen hundred miles of river four times traversed in every thirty-five days -- the time required by that swift boat to achieve two round trips .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 43]: We discussed , and discussed , and discussed , and disputed and disputed and disputed ; at any rate , HE did , and I got in a word now and then when he slipped a cog and there was a vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 45]: He did his arguing with heat , with energy , with violence ; and I did mine with the reverse and moderation of a subordinate who does not like to be flung out of a pilot-house and is perched forty feet above the water .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 20]: He was fiercely loyal to Shakespeare and cordially scornful of Bacon and of all the pretensions of the Baconians .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 7]: So was I -- at first .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 12]: And at first he was glad that that was my attitude .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 82]: There were even indications that he admired it ; indications dimmed , it is true , by the distance that lay between the lofty boss-pilotical altitude and my lowly one , yet perceptible to me ; perceptible , and translatable into a compliment -- compliment coming down from about the snow-line and not well thawed in the transit , and not likely to set anything afire , not even a cub-pilot 's self-conceit ; still a detectable complement , and precious .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 33]: Naturally it flattered me into being more loyal to Shakespeare -- if possible -- than I was before , and more prejudiced against Bacon -- if possible -- that I was before .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 17]: And so we discussed and discussed , both on the same side , and were happy .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 4]: For a while .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 5]: Only for a while .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 16]: Only for a very little while , a very , very , very little while .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 12]: Then the atmosphere began to change ; began to cool off .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 29]: A brighter person would have seen what the trouble was , earlier than I did , perhaps , but I saw it early enough for all practical purposes .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 10]: You see , he was of an argumentative disposition .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 55]: Therefore it took him but a little time to get tired of arguing with a person who agreed with everything he said and consequently never furnished him a provocative to flare up and show what he could do when it came to clear , cold , hard , rose-cut , hundred-faceted , diamond-flashing REASONING .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 7]: That was his name for it .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 20]: It has been applied since , with complacency , as many as several times , in the Bacon-Shakespeare scuffle .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 5]: On the Shakespeare side .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 46]: Then the thing happened which has happened to more persons than to me when principle and personal interest found themselves in opposition to each other and a choice had to be made : I let principle go , and went over to the other side .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 16]: Not the entire way , but far enough to answer the requirements of the case .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 27]: That is to say , I took this attitude -- to wit , I only BELIEVED Bacon wrote Shakespeare , whereas I KNEW Shakespeare did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 12]: Ealer was satisfied with that , and the war broke loose .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 50]: Study , practice , experience in handling my end of the matter presently enabled me to take my new position almost seriously ; a little bit later , utterly seriously ; a little later still , lovingly , gratefully , devotedly ; finally : fiercely , rabidly , uncompromisingly .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 40]: After that I was welded to my faith , I was theoretically ready to die for it , and I looked down with compassion not unmixed with scorn upon everybody else 's faith that did n't tally with mine .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 33]: That faith , imposed upon me by self-interest in that ancient day , remains my faith today , and in it I find comfort , solace , peace , and never-failing joy .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 8]: You see how curiously theological it is .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 37]: The `` rice Christian '' of the Orient goes through the very same steps , when he is after rice and the missionary is after HIM ; he goes for rice , and remains to worship .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 18]: Ealer did a lot of our `` reasoning '' -- not to say substantially all of it .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 16]: The slaves of his cult have a passion for calling it by that large name .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 17]: We others do not call our inductions and deductions and reductions by any name at all .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 28]: They show for themselves what they are , and we can with tranquil confidence leave the world to ennoble them with a title of its own choosing .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 57]: Now and then when Ealer had to stop to cough , I pulled my induction-talents together and hove the controversial lead myself : always getting eight feet , eight and a half , often nine , sometimes even quarter-less-twain -- as _ I _ believed ; but always `` no bottom , '' as HE said .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 9]: I got the best of him only once .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 4]: I prepared myself .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 34]: I wrote out a passage from Shakespeare -- it may have been the very one I quoted awhile ago , I do n't remember -- and riddled it with his wild steamboatful interlardings .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 73]: When an unrisky opportunity offered , one lovely summer day , when we had sounded and buoyed a tangled patch of crossings known as Hell 's Half Acre , and were aboard again and he had sneaked the PENNSYLVANIA triumphantly through it without once scraping sand , and the A. T. LACEY had followed in our wake and got stuck , and he was feeling good , I showed it to him .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 4]: It amused him .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 26]: I asked him to fire it off -- READ it ; read it , I diplomatically added , as only HE could read dramatic poetry .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 8]: The compliment touched him where he lived .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 82]: He did read it ; read it with surpassing fire and spirit ; read it as it will never be read again ; for HE know how to put the right music into those thunderous interlardings and make them seem a part of the text , make them sound as if they were bursting from Shakespeare 's own soul , each one of them a golden inspiration and not to be left out without damage to the massed and magnificent whole .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 121]: I waited a week , to let the incident fade ; waited longer ; waited until he brought up for reasonings and vituperation my pet position , my pet argument , the one which I was fondest of , the one which I prized far above all others in my ammunition-wagon -- to wit , that Shakespeare could n't have written Shakespeare 's words , for the reason that the man who wrote them was limitlessly familiar with the laws , and the law-courts , and law-proceedings , and lawyer-talk , and lawyer-ways -- and if Shakespeare was possessed of the infinitely divided star-dust that constituted this vast wealth , HOW did he get it , and WHERE and WHEN ?
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 5]: `` From books . ''
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 3]: From books !
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 6]: That was always the idea .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 47]: I answered as my readings of the champions of my side of the great controversy had taught me to answer : that a man ca n't handle glibly and easily and comfortably and successfully the argot of a trade at which he has not personally served .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 51]: He will make mistakes ; he will not , and can not , get the trade-phrasings precisely and exactly right ; and the moment he departs , by even a shade , from a common trade-form , the reader who has served that trade will know the writer HAS N'T .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 31]: Ealer would not be convinced ; he said a man could learn how to correctly handle the subtleties and mysteries and free-masonries of ANY trade by careful reading and studying .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 61]: But when I got him to read again the passage from Shakespeare with the interlardings , he perceived , himself , that books could n't teach a student a bewildering multitude of pilot-phrases so thoroughly and perfectly that he could talk them off in book and play or conversation and make no mistake that a pilot would not immediately discover .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 7]: It was a triumph for me .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 18]: He was silent awhile , and I knew what was happening -- he was losing his temper .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 57]: And I knew he would presently close the session with the same old argument that was always his stay and his support in time of need ; the same old argument , the one I could n't answer , because I das n't -- the argument that I was an ass , and better shut up .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 8]: He delivered it , and I obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 14]: O dear , how long ago it was -- how pathetically long ago !
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 24]: And here am I , old , forsaken , forlorn , and alone , arranging to get that argument out of somebody again .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 22]: When a man has a passion for Shakespeare , it goes without saying that he keeps company with other standard authors .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 33]: Ealer always had several high-class books in the pilot-house , and he read the same ones over and over again , and did not care to change to newer and fresher ones .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 14]: He played well on the flute , and greatly enjoyed hearing himself play .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 4]: So did I .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 48]: He had a notion that a flute would keep its health better if you took it apart when it was not standing a watch ; and so , when it was not on duty it took its rest , disjointed , on the compass-shelf under the breastboard .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 49]: When the PENNSYLVANIA blew up and became a drifting rack-heap freighted with wounded and dying poor souls -LRB- my young brother Henry among them -RRB- , pilot Brown had the watch below , and was probably asleep and never knew what killed him ; but Ealer escaped unhurt .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 65]: He and his pilot-house were shot up into the air ; then they fell , and Ealer sank through the ragged cavern where the hurricane-deck and the boiler-deck had been , and landed in a nest of ruins on the main deck , on top of one of the unexploded boilers , where he lay prone in a fog of scald and deadly steam .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 5]: But not for long .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 24]: He did not lose his head -- long familiarity with danger had taught him to keep it , in any and all emergencies .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 45]: He held his coat-lapels to his nose with one hand , to keep out the steam , and scrabbled around with the other till he found the joints of his flute , then he took measures to save himself alive , and was successful .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 6]: I was not on board .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 12]: I had been put ashore in New Orleans by Captain Klinenfelter .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 35]: The reason -- however , I have told all about it in the book called OLD TIMES ON THE MISSISSIPPI , and it is n't important , anyway , it is so long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 32]: II When I was a Sunday-school scholar , something more than sixty years ago , I became interested in Satan , and wanted to find out all I could about him .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 27]: I began to ask questions , but my class-teacher , Mr. Barclay , the stone-mason , was reluctant about answering them , it seemed to me .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 32]: I was anxious to be praised for turning my thoughts to serious subjects when there was n't another boy in the village who could be hired to do such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 22]: I was greatly interested in the incident of Eve and the serpent , and thought Eve 's calmness was perfectly noble .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 31]: I asked Mr. Barclay if he had ever heard of another woman who , being approached by a serpent , would not excuse herself and break for the nearest timber .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 20]: He did not answer my question , but rebuked me for inquiring into matters above my age and comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 34]: I will say for Mr. Barclay that he was willing to tell me the facts of Satan 's history , but he stopped there : he would n't allow any discussion of them .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 10]: In the course of time we exhausted the facts .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 19]: There were only five or six of them ; you could set them all down on a visiting-card .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 4]: I was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 18]: I had been meditating a biography , and was grieved to find that there were no materials .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 11]: I said as much , with the tears running down .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 41]: Mr. Barclay 's sympathy and compassion were aroused , for he was a most kind and gentle-spirited man , and he patted me on the head and cheered me up by saying there was a whole vast ocean of materials !
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 15]: I can still feel the happy thrill which these blessed words shot through me .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 16]: Then he began to bail out that ocean 's riches for my encouragement and joy .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 46]: Like this : it was `` conjectured '' -- though not established -- that Satan was originally an angel in Heaven ; that he fell ; that he rebelled , and brought on a war ; that he was defeated , and banished to perdition .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 110]: Also , `` we have reason to believe '' that later he did so and so ; that `` we are warranted in supposing '' that at a subsequent time he traveled extensively , seeking whom he might devour ; that a couple of centuries afterward , `` as tradition instructs us , '' he took up the cruel trade of tempting people to their ruin , with vast and fearful results ; that by and by , `` as the probabilities seem to indicate , '' he may have done certain things , he might have done certain other things , he must have done still other things .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 7]: And so on and so on .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 135]: We set down the five known facts by themselves on a piece of paper , and numbered it `` page 1 '' ; then on fifteen hundred other pieces of paper we set down the `` conjectures , '' and `` suppositions , '' and `` maybes , '' and `` perhapses , '' and `` doubtlesses , '' and `` rumors , '' and `` guesses , '' and `` probabilities , '' and `` likelihoods , '' and `` we are permitted to thinks , '' and `` we are warranted in believings , '' and `` might have beens , '' and `` could have beens , '' and `` must have beens , '' and `` unquestionablys , '' and `` without a shadow of doubt '' -- and behold !
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 2]: MATERIALS ?
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 12]: Why , we had enough to build a biography of Shakespeare !
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 20]: Yet he made me put away my pen ; he would not let me write the history of Satan .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 35]: Because , as he said , he had suspicions -- suspicions that my attitude in the matter was not reverent , and that a person must be reverent when writing about the sacred characters .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 24]: He said any one who spoke flippantly of Satan would be frowned upon by the religious world and also be brought to account .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 48]: I assured him , in earnest and sincere words , that he had wholly misconceived my attitude ; that I had the highest respect for Satan , and that my reverence for him equaled , and possibly even exceeded , that of any member of the church .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 62]: I said it wounded me deeply to perceive by his words that he thought I would make fun of Satan , and deride him , laugh at him , scoff at him ; whereas in truth I had never thought of such a thing , but had only a warm desire to make fun of those others and laugh at THEM .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 5]: `` What others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 57]: `` Why , the Supposers , the Perhapsers , the Might-Have-Beeners , the Could-Have-Beeners , the Must-Have-Beeners , the Without-a-Shadow-of-Doubters , the We-Are-Warranted-in-Believingers , and all that funny crop of solemn architects who have taken a good solid foundation of five indisputable and unimportant facts and built upon it a Conjectural Satan thirty miles high . ''
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 7]: What did Mr. Barclay do then ?
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 4]: Was he disarmed ?
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 4]: Was he silenced ?
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 4]: He was shocked .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 9]: He was so shocked that he visibly shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 13]: He said the Satanic Traditioners and Perhapsers and Conjecturers were THEMSELVES sacred !
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 6]: As sacred as their work .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 29]: So sacred that whoso ventured to mock them or make fun of their work , could not afterward enter any respectable house , even by the back door .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 10]: How true were his words , and how wise !
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 14]: How fortunate it would have been for me if I had heeded them .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 24]: But I was young , I was but seven years of age , and vain , foolish , and anxious to attract attention .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 15]: I wrote the biography , and have never been in a respectable house since .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 24]: III How curious and interesting is the parallel -- as far as poverty of biographical details is concerned -- between Satan and Shakespeare .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 34]: It is wonderful , it is unique , it stands quite alone , there is nothing resembling it in history , nothing resembling it in romance , nothing approaching it even in tradition .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 26]: How sublime is their position , and how over-topping , how sky-reaching , how supreme -- the two Great Unknowns , the two Illustrious Conjecturabilities !
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 15]: They are the best-known unknown persons that have ever drawn breath upon the planet .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 34]: For the instruction of the ignorant I will make a list , now , of those details of Shakespeare 's history which are FACTS -- verified facts , established facts , undisputed facts .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 12]: Facts He was born on the 23d of April , 1564 .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 19]: Of good farmer-class parents who could not read , could not write , could not sign their names .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 20]: At Stratford , a small back settlement which in that day was shabby and unclean , and densely illiterate .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 34]: Of the nineteen important men charged with the government of the town , thirteen had to `` make their mark '' in attesting important documents , because they could not write their names .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 12]: Of the first eighteen years of his life NOTHING is known .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 5]: They are a blank .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 19]: On the 27th of November -LRB- 1582 -RRB- William Shakespeare took out a license to marry Anne Whateley .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 13]: Next day William Shakespeare took out a license to marry Anne Hathaway .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 7]: She was eight years his senior .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 6]: William Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 4]: In a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 16]: By grace of a reluctantly granted dispensation there was but one publication of the banns .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 9]: Within six months the first child was born .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 24]: About two -LRB- blank -RRB- years followed , during which period NOTHING AT ALL HAPPENED TO SHAKESPEARE , so far as anybody knows .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 6]: Then came twins -- 1585 .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 2]: February .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 5]: Two blank years follow .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 17]: Then -- 1587 -- he makes a ten-year visit to London , leaving the family behind .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 5]: Five blank years follow .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 15]: During this period NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM , as far as anybody actually knows .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 13]: Then -- 1592 -- there is mention of him as an actor .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 15]: Next year -- 1593 -- his name appears in the official list of players .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 11]: Next year -- 1594 -- he played before the queen .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 19]: A detail of no consequence : other obscurities did it every year of the forty-five of her reign .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 4]: And remained obscure .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 6]: Three pretty full years follow .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 4]: Full of play-acting .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 10]: Then In 1597 he bought New Place , Stratford .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 22]: Thirteen or fourteen busy years follow ; years in which he accumulated money , and also reputation as actor and manager .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 30]: Meantime his name , liberally and variously spelt , had become associated with a number of great plays and poems , as -LRB- ostensibly -RRB- author of the same .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 19]: Some of these , in these years and later , were pirated , but he made no protest .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 93]: Then -- 1610-11 -- he returned to Stratford and settled down for good and all , and busied himself in lending money , trading in tithes , trading in land and houses ; shirking a debt of forty-one shillings , borrowed by his wife during his long desertion of his family ; suing debtors for shillings and coppers ; being sued himself for shillings and coppers ; and acting as confederate to a neighbor who tried to rob the town of its rights in a certain common , and did not succeed .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 18]: He lived five or six years -- till 1616 -- in the joy of these elevated pursuits .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 17]: Then he made a will , and signed each of its three pages with his name .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 7]: A thoroughgoing business man 's will .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 42]: It named in minute detail every item of property he owned in the world -- houses , lands , sword , silver-gilt bowl , and so on -- all the way down to his `` second-best bed '' and its furniture .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 20]: It carefully and calculatingly distributed his riches among the members of his family , overlooking no individual of it .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 76]: Not even his wife : the wife he had been enabled to marry in a hurry by urgent grace of a special dispensation before he was nineteen ; the wife whom he had left husbandless so many years ; the wife who had had to borrow forty-one shillings in her need , and which the lender was never able to collect of the prosperous husband , but died at last with the money still lacking .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 12]: No , even this wife was remembered in Shakespeare 's will .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 9]: He left her that `` second-best bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 16]: And NOT ANOTHER THING ; not even a penny to bless her lucky widowhood with .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 16]: It was eminently and conspicuously a business man 's will , not a poet 's .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 7]: It mentioned NOT A SINGLE BOOK .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 34]: Books were much more precious than swords and silver-gilt bowls and second-best beds in those days , and when a departing person owned one he gave it a high place in his will .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 26]: The will mentioned NOT A PLAY , NOT A POEM , NOT AN UNFINISHED LITERARY WORK , NOT A SCRAP OF MANUSCRIPT OF ANY KIND .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 28]: Many poets have died poor , but this is the only one in history that has died THIS poor ; the others all left literary remains behind .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 4]: Also a book .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 3]: Maybe two .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 25]: If Shakespeare had owned a dog -- but we not go into that : we know he would have mentioned it in his will .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 26]: If a good dog , Susanna would have got it ; if an inferior one his wife would have got a downer interest in it .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 31]: I wish he had had a dog , just so we could see how painstakingly he would have divided that dog among the family , in his careful business way .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 8]: He signed the will in three places .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 10]: In earlier years he signed two other official documents .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 6]: These five signatures still exist .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 11]: There are NO OTHER SPECIMENS OF HIS PENMANSHIP IN EXISTENCE .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 4]: Not a line .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 7]: Was he prejudiced against the art ?
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 64]: His granddaughter , whom he loved , was eight years old when he died , yet she had had no teaching , he left no provision for her education , although he was rich , and in her mature womanhood she could n't write and could n't tell her husband 's manuscript from anybody else 's -- she thought it was Shakespeare 's .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 12]: When Shakespeare died in Stratford , IT WAS NOT AN EVENT .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 19]: It made no more stir in England than the death of any other forgotten theater-actor would have made .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 28]: Nobody came down from London ; there were no lamenting poems , no eulogies , no national tears -- there was merely silence , and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 34]: A striking contrast with what happened when Ben Jonson , and Francis Bacon , and Spenser , and Raleigh , and the other distinguished literary folk of Shakespeare 's time passed from life !
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 23]: No praiseful voice was lifted for the lost Bard of Avon ; even Ben Jonson waited seven years before he lifted his .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 21]: SO FAR AS ANYBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS AND CAN PROVE , Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon never wrote a play in his life .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 16]: SO FAR AS ANY ONE KNOWS , HE RECEIVED ONLY ONE LETTER DURING HIS LIFE .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 21]: So far as any one KNOWS AND CAN PROVE , Shakespeare of Stratford wrote only one poem during his life .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 5]: This one is authentic .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 31]: He did write that one -- a fact which stands undisputed ; he wrote the whole of it ; he wrote the whole of it out of his own head .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 18]: He commanded that this work of art be engraved upon his tomb , and he was obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 7]: There it abides to this day .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 34]: This is it : Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare : Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my bones .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 27]: In the list as above set down will be found EVERY POSITIVELY KNOWN fact of Shakespeare 's life , lean and meager as the invoice is .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 11]: Beyond these details we know NOT A THING about him .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 50]: All the rest of his vast history , as furnished by the biographers , is built up , course upon course , of guesses , inferences , theories , conjectures -- an Eiffel Tower of artificialities rising sky-high from a very flat and very thin foundation of inconsequential facts .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 28]: IV Conjectures The historians `` suppose '' that Shakespeare attended the Free School in Stratford from the time he was seven years old till he was thirteen .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 15]: There is no EVIDENCE in existence that he ever went to school at all .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 24]: The historians `` infer '' that he got his Latin in that school -- the school which they `` suppose '' he attended .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 37]: They `` suppose '' his father 's declining fortunes made it necessary for him to leave the school they supposed he attended , and get to work and help support his parents and their ten children .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 19]: But there is no evidence that he ever entered or returned from the school they suppose he attended .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 35]: They `` suppose '' he assisted his father in the butchering business ; and that , being only a boy , he did n't have to do full-grown butchering , but only slaughtering calves .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 16]: Also , that whenever he killed a calf he made a high-flown speech over it .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 81]: This supposition rests upon the testimony of a man who was n't there at the time ; a man who got it from a man who could have been there , but did not say whether he was nor not ; and neither of them thought to mention it for decades , and decades , and decades , and two more decades after Shakespeare 's death -LRB- until old age and mental decay had refreshed and vivified their memories -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 32]: They had n't two facts in stock about the long-dead distinguished citizen , but only just the one : he slaughtered calves and broke into oratory while he was at it .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 2]: Curious .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 24]: They had only one fact , yet the distinguished citizen had spent twenty-six years in that little town -- just half his lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 26]: However , rightly viewed , it was the most important fact , indeed almost the only important fact , of Shakespeare 's life in Stratford .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 3]: Rightly viewed .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 31]: For experience is an author 's most valuable asset ; experience is the thing that puts the muscle and the breath and the warm blood into the book he writes .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 19]: Rightly viewed , calf-butchering accounts for `` Titus Andronicus , '' the only play -- ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 27]: -- that the Stratford Shakespeare ever wrote ; and yet it is the only one everybody tried to chouse him out of , the Baconians included .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 30]: The historians find themselves `` justified in believing '' that the young Shakespeare poached upon Sir Thomas Lucy 's deer preserves and got haled before that magistrate for it .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 15]: But there is no shred of respectworthy evidence that anything of the kind happened .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 31]: The historians , having argued the thing that MIGHT have happened into the thing that DID happen , found no trouble in turning Sir Thomas Lucy into Mr. Justice Shallow .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 21]: They have long ago convinced the world -- on surmise and without trustworthy evidence -- that Shallow IS Sir Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 13]: The next addition to the young Shakespeare 's Stratford history comes easy .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 61]: The historian builds it out of the surmised deer-steeling , and the surmised trial before the magistrate , and the surmised vengeance-prompted satire upon the magistrate in the play : result , the young Shakespeare was a wild , wild , wild , oh , SUCH a wild young scamp , and that gratuitous slander is established for all time !
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 47]: It is the very way Professor Osborn and I built the colossal skeleton brontosaur that stands fifty-seven feet long and sixteen feet high in the Natural History Museum , the awe and admiration of all the world , the stateliest skeleton that exists on the planet .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 18]: We had nine bones , and we built the rest of him out of plaster of Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 39]: We ran short of plaster of Paris , or we 'd have built a brontosaur that could sit down beside the Stratford Shakespeare and none but an expert could tell which was biggest or contained the most plaster .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 28]: Shakespeare pronounced `` Venus and Adonis '' `` the first heir of his invention , '' apparently implying that it was his first effort at literary composition .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 7]: He should not have said it .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 14]: It has been an embarrassment to his historians these many , many years .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 60]: They have to make him write that graceful and polished and flawless and beautiful poem before he escaped from Stratford and his family -- 1586 or ' 87 -- age , twenty-two , or along there ; because within the next five years he wrote five great plays , and could not have found time to write another line .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 5]: It is sorely embarrassing .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 62]: If he began to slaughter calves , and poach deer , and rollick around , and learn English , at the earliest likely moment -- say at thirteen , when he was supposably wretched from that school where he was supposably storing up Latin for future literary use -- he had his youthful hands full , and much more than full .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 25]: He must have had to put aside his Warwickshire dialect , which would n't be understood in London , and study English very hard .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 55]: Very hard indeed ; incredibly hard , almost , if the result of that labor was to be the smooth and rounded and flexible and letter-perfect English of the `` Venus and Adonis '' in the space of ten years ; and at the same time learn great and fine and unsurpassable literary FORM .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 138]: However , it is `` conjectured '' that he accomplished all this and more , much more : learned law and its intricacies ; and the complex procedure of the law-courts ; and all about soldiering , and sailoring , and the manners and customs and ways of royal courts and aristocratic society ; and likewise accumulated in his one head every kind of knowledge the learned then possessed , and every kind of humble knowledge possessed by the lowly and the ignorant ; and added thereto a wider and more intimate knowledge of the world 's great literatures , ancient and modern , than was possessed by any other man of his time -- for he was going to make brilliant and easy and admiration-compelling use of these splendid treasures the moment he got to London .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 12]: And according to the surmisers , that is what he did .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 29]: Yes , although there was no one in Stratford able to teach him these things , and no library in the little village to dig them out of .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 19]: His father could not read , and even the surmisers surmise that he did not keep a library .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 94]: It is surmised by the biographers that the young Shakespeare got his vast knowledge of the law and his familiar and accurate acquaintance with the manners and customs and shop-talk of lawyers through being for a time the CLERK OF A STRATFORD COURT ; just as a bright lad like me , reared in a village on the banks of the Mississippi , might become perfect in knowledge of the Bering Strait whale-fishery and the shop-talk of the veteran exercises of that adventure-bristling trade through catching catfish with a `` trot-line '' Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 30]: But the surmise is damaged by the fact that there is no evidence -- and not even tradition -- that the young Shakespeare was ever clerk of a law-court .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 50]: It is further surmised that the young Shakespeare accumulated his law-treasures in the first years of his sojourn in London , through `` amusing himself '' by learning book-law in his garret and by picking up lawyer-talk and the rest of it through loitering about the law-courts and listening .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 19]: But it is only surmise ; there is no EVIDENCE that he ever did either of those things .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 12]: They are merely a couple of chunks of plaster of Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 25]: There is a legend that he got his bread and butter by holding horses in front of the London theaters , mornings and afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 4]: Maybe he did .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 17]: If he did , it seriously shortened his law-study hours and his recreation-time in the courts .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 19]: In those very days he was writing great plays , and needed all the time he could get .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 60]: The horse-holding legend ought to be strangled ; it too formidably increases the historian 's difficulty in accounting for the young Shakespeare 's erudition -- an erudition which he was acquiring , hunk by hunk and chunk by chunk , every day in those strenuous times , and emptying each day 's catch into next day 's imperishable drama .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 55]: He had to acquire a knowledge of war at the same time ; and a knowledge of soldier-people and sailor-people and their ways and talk ; also a knowledge of some foreign lands and their languages : for he was daily emptying fluent streams of these various knowledges , too , into his dramas .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 8]: How did he acquire these rich assets ?
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 8]: In the usual way : by surmise .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 102]: It is SURMISED that he traveled in Italy and Germany and around , and qualified himself to put their scenic and social aspects upon paper ; that he perfected himself in French , Italian , and Spanish on the road ; that he went in Leicester 's expedition to the Low Countries , as soldier or sutler or something , for several months or years -- or whatever length of time a surmiser needs in his business -- and thus became familiar with soldiership and soldier-ways and soldier-talk and generalship and general-ways and general-talk , and seamanship and sailor-ways and sailor-talk .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 40]: Maybe he did all these things , but I would like to know who held the horses in the mean time ; and who studied the books in the garret ; and who frolicked in the law-courts for recreation .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 10]: Also , who did the call-boying and the play-acting .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 56]: For he became a call-boy ; and as early as '93 he became a `` vagabond '' -- the law 's ungentle term for an unlisted actor ; and in '94 a `` regular '' and properly and officially listed member of that -LRB- in those days -RRB- lightly valued and not much respected profession .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 16]: Right soon thereafter he became a stockholder in two theaters , and manager of them .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 22]: Thenceforward he was a busy and flourishing business man , and was raking in money with both hands for twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 58]: Then in a noble frenzy of poetic inspiration he wrote his one poem -- his only poem , his darling -- and laid him down and died : Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare : Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my bones .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 9]: He was probably dead when he wrote it .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 7]: Still , this is only conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 6]: We have only circumstantial evidence .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 3]: Internal evidence .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 18]: Shall I set down the rest of the Conjectures which constitute the giant Biography of William Shakespeare ?
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 10]: It would strain the Unabridged Dictionary to hold them .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 16]: He is a brontosaur : nine bones and six hundred barrels of plaster of Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 19]: V `` We May Assume '' In the Assuming trade three separate and independent cults are transacting business .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 23]: Two of these cults are known as the Shakespearites and the Baconians , and I am the other one -- the Brontosaurian .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 50]: The Shakespearite knows that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare 's Works ; the Baconian knows that Francis Bacon wrote them ; the Brontosaurian does n't really know which of them did it , but is quite composedly and contentedly sure that Shakespeare DID N'T , and strongly suspects that Bacon DID .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 36]: We all have to do a good deal of assuming , but I am fairly certain that in every case I can call to mind the Baconian assumers have come out ahead of the Shakespearites .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 34]: Both parties handle the same materials , but the Baconians seem to me to get much more reasonable and rational and persuasive results out of them than is the case with the Shakespearites .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 33]: The Shakespearite conducts his assuming upon a definite principle , an unchanging and immutable law : which is : 2 and 8 and 7 and 14 , added together , make 165 .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 8]: I believe this to be an error .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 19]: No matter , you can not get a habit-sodden Shakespearite to cipher-up his materials upon any other basis .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 7]: With the Baconian it is different .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 45]: If you place before him the above figures and set him to adding them up , he will never in any case get more than 45 out of them , and in nine cases out of ten he will get just the proper 31 .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 28]: Let me try to illustrate the two systems in a simple and homely way calculated to bring the idea within the grasp of the ignorant and unintelligent .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 67]: We will suppose a case : take a lap-bred , house-fed , uneducated , inexperienced kitten ; take a rugged old Tom that 's scarred from stem to rudder-post with the memorials of strenuous experience , and is so cultured , so educated , so limitlessly erudite that one may say of him `` all cat-knowledge is his province '' ; also , take a mouse .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 13]: Lock the three up in a holeless , crackless , exitless prison-cell .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 24]: Wait half an hour , then open the cell , introduce a Shakespearite and a Baconian , and let them cipher and assume .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 16]: The mouse is missing : the question to be decided is , where is it ?
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 7]: You can guess both verdicts beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 23]: One verdict will say the kitten contains the mouse ; the other will as certainly say the mouse is in the tom-cat .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 19]: The Shakespearite will Reason like this -- -LRB- that is not my word , it is his -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 170]: He will say the kitten MAY HAVE BEEN attending school when nobody was noticing ; therefore WE ARE WARRANTED IN ASSUMING that it did so ; also , it COULD HAVE BEEN training in a court-clerk 's office when no one was noticing ; since that could have happened , WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN ASSUMING that it did happen ; it COULD HAVE STUDIED CATOLOGY IN A GARRET when no one was noticing -- therefore it DID ; it COULD HAVE attended cat-assizes on the shed-roof nights , for recreation , when no one was noticing , and have harvested a knowledge of cat court-forms and cat lawyer-talk in that way : it COULD have done it , therefore without a doubt it DID ; it COULD HAVE gone soldiering with a war-tribe when no one was noticing , and learned soldier-wiles and soldier-ways , and what to do with a mouse when opportunity offers ; the plain inference , therefore , is that that is what it DID .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 19]: Since all these manifold things COULD have occurred , we have EVERY RIGHT TO BELIEVE they did occur .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 24]: These patiently and painstakingly accumulated vast acquirements and competences needed but one thing more -- opportunity -- to convert themselves into triumphal action .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 20]: The opportunity came , we have the result ; BEYOND SHADOW OF QUESTION the mouse is in the kitten .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 62]: It is proper to remark that when we of the three cults plant a `` WE THINK WE MAY ASSUME , '' we expect it , under careful watering and fertilizing and tending , to grow up into a strong and hardy and weather-defying `` THERE IS N'T A SHADOW OF A DOUBT '' at last -- and it usually happens .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 87]: We know what the Baconian 's verdict would be : `` THERE IS NOT A RAG OF EVIDENCE THAT THE KITTEN HAS HAD ANY TRAINING , ANY EDUCATION , ANY EXPERIENCE QUALIFYING IT FOR THE PRESENT OCCASION , OR IS INDEED EQUIPPED FOR ANY ACHIEVEMENT ABOVE LIFTING SUCH UNCLAIMED MILK AS COMES ITS WAY ; BUT THERE IS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE -- UNASSAILABLE PROOF , IN FACT -- THAT THE OTHER ANIMAL IS EQUIPPED , TO THE LAST DETAIL , WITH EVERY QUALIFICATION NECESSARY FOR THE EVENT .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 11]: WITHOUT SHADOW OF DOUBT THE TOM-CAT CONTAINS THE MOUSE . ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 30]: VI When Shakespeare died , in 1616 , great literary productions attributed to him as author had been before the London world and in high favor for twenty-four years .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 8]: Yet his death was not an event .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 10]: It made no stir , it attracted no attention .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 18]: Apparently his eminent literary contemporaries did not realize that a celebrated poet had passed from their midst .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 23]: Perhaps they knew a play-actor of minor rank had disappeared , but did not regard him as the author of his Works .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 9]: `` We are justified in assuming '' this .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 14]: His death was not even an event in the little town of Stratford .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 17]: Does this mean that in Stratford he was not regarded as a celebrity of ANY kind ?
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 23]: `` We are privileged to assume '' -- no , we are indeed OBLIGED to assume -- that such was the case .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 41]: He had spent the first twenty-two or twenty-three years of his life there , and of course knew everybody and was known by everybody of that day in the town , including the dogs and the cats and the horses .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 57]: He had spent the last five or six years of his life there , diligently trading in every big and little thing that had money in it ; so we are compelled to assume that many of the folk there in those said latter days knew him personally , and the rest by sight and hearsay .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 6]: But not as a CELEBRITY ?
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 3]: Apparently not .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 17]: For everybody soon forgot to remember any contact with him or any incident connected with him .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 52]: The dozens of townspeople , still alive , who had known of him or known about him in the first twenty-three years of his life were in the same unremembering condition : if they knew of any incident connected with that period of his life they did n't tell about it .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 8]: Would the if they had been asked ?
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 5]: It is most likely .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 4]: Were they asked ?
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 9]: It is pretty apparent that they were not .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 5]: Why were n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 16]: It is a very plausible guess that nobody there or elsewhere was interested to know .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 16]: For seven years after Shakespeare 's death nobody seems to have been interested in him .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 31]: Then the quarto was published , and Ben Jonson awoke out of his long indifference and sang a song of praise and put it in the front of the book .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 5]: Then silence fell AGAIN .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 4]: For sixty years .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 15]: Then inquiries into Shakespeare 's Stratford life began to be made , of Stratfordians .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 11]: Of Stratfordians who had known Shakespeare or had seen him ?
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 18]: Then of Stratfordians who had seen people who had known or seen people who had seen Shakespeare ?
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 77]: Apparently the inquires were only made of Stratfordians who were not Stratfordians of Shakespeare 's day , but later comers ; and what they had learned had come to them from persons who had not seen Shakespeare ; and what they had learned was not claimed as FACT , but only as legend -- dim and fading and indefinite legend ; legend of the calf-slaughtering rank , and not worth remembering either as history or fiction .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 57]: Has it ever happened before -- or since -- that a celebrated person who had spent exactly half of a fairly long life in the village where he was born and reared , was able to slip out of this world and leave that village voiceless and gossipless behind him -- utterly voiceless. , utterly gossipless ?
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 4]: And permanently so ?
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 14]: I do n't believe it has happened in any case except Shakespeare 's .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 26]: And could n't and would n't have happened in his case if he had been regarded as a celebrity at the time of his death .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 57]: When I examine my own case -- but let us do that , and see if it will not be recognizable as exhibiting a condition of things quite likely to result , most likely to result , indeed substantially SURE to result in the case of a celebrated person , a benefactor of the human race .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 3]: Like me .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 29]: My parents brought me to the village of Hannibal , Missouri , on the banks of the Mississippi , when I was two and a half years old .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 26]: I entered school at five years of age , and drifted from one school to another in the village during nine and a half years .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 49]: Then my father died , leaving his family in exceedingly straitened circumstances ; wherefore my book-education came to a standstill forever , and I became a printer 's apprentice , on board and clothes , and when the clothes failed I got a hymn-book in place of them .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 7]: This for summer wear , probably .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 29]: I lived in Hannibal fifteen and a half years , altogether , then ran away , according to the custom of persons who are intending to become celebrated .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 6]: I never lived there afterward .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 87]: Four years later I became a `` cub '' on a Mississippi steamboat in the St. Louis and New Orleans trade , and after a year and a half of hard study and hard work the U.S. inspectors rigorously examined me through a couple of long sittings and decided that I knew every inch of the Mississippi -- thirteen hundred miles -- in the dark and in the day -- as well as a baby knows the way to its mother 's paps day or night .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 32]: So they licensed me as a pilot -- knighted me , so to speak -- and I rose up clothed with authority , a responsible servant of the United States Government .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 3]: Now then .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 9]: Shakespeare died young -- he was only fifty-two .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 14]: He had lived in his native village twenty-six years , or about that .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 15]: He died celebrated -LRB- if you believe everything you read in the books -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 34]: Yet when he died nobody there or elsewhere took any notice of it ; and for sixty years afterward no townsman remembered to say anything about him or about his life in Stratford .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 49]: When the inquirer came at last he got but one fact -- no , LEGEND -- and got that one at second hand , from a person who had only heard it as a rumor and did n't claim copyright in it as a production of his own .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 15]: He could n't , very well , for its date antedated his own birth-date .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 70]: But necessarily a number of persons were still alive in Stratford who , in the days of their youth , had seen Shakespeare nearly every day in the last five years of his life , and they would have been able to tell that inquirer some first-hand things about him if he had in those last days been a celebrity and therefore a person of interest to the villagers .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 12]: Why did not the inquirer hunt them up and interview them ?
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 6]: Was n't it worth while ?
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 8]: Was n't the matter of sufficient consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 16]: Had the inquirer an engagement to see a dog-fight and could n't spare the time ?
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 26]: It all seems to mean that he never had any literary celebrity , there or elsewhere , and no considerable repute as actor and manager .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 93]: Now then , I am away along in life -- my seventy-third year being already well behind me -- yet SIXTEEN of my Hannibal schoolmates are still alive today , and can tell -- and do tell -- inquirers dozens and dozens of incidents of their young lives and mine together ; things that happened to us in the morning of life , in the blossom of our youth , in the good days , the dear days , `` the days when we went gipsying , a long time ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 9]: Most of them creditable to me , too .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 49]: One child to whom I paid court when she was five years old and I eight still lives in Hannibal , and she visited me last summer , traversing the necessary ten or twelve hundred miles of railroad without damage to her patience or to her old-young vigor .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 38]: Another little lassie to whom I paid attention in Hannibal when she was nine years old and I the same , is still alive -- in London -- and hale and hearty , just as I am .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 101]: And on the few surviving steamboats -- those lingering ghosts and remembrancers of great fleets that plied the big river in the beginning of my water-career -- which is exactly as long ago as the whole invoice of the life-years of Shakespeare numbers -- there are still findable two or three river-pilots who saw me do creditable things in those ancient days ; and several white-headed engineers ; and several roustabouts and mates ; and several deck-hands who used to heave the lead for me and send up on the still night the `` Six -- feet -- SCANT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 13]: that made me shudder , and the `` M-a-r-k -- TWAIN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 18]: that took the shudder away , and presently the darling `` By the d-e-e-p -- FOUR ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 8]: that lifted me to heaven for joy .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 12]: -LRB- 1 -RRB- They know about me , and can tell .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 24]: And so do printers , from St. Louis to New York ; and so do newspaper reporters , from Nevada to San Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 6]: And so do the police .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 32]: If Shakespeare had really been celebrated , like me , Stratford could have told things about him ; and if my experience goes for anything , they 'd have done it .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 6]: Four fathoms -- twenty-four feet .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 39]: VII If I had under my superintendence a controversy appointed to decide whether Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare or not , I believe I would place before the debaters only the one question , WAS SHAKESPEARE EVER A PRACTICING LAWYER ?
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 6]: and leave everything else out .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 74]: It is maintained that the man who wrote the plays was not merely myriad-minded , but also myriad-accomplished : that he not only knew some thousands of things about human life in all its shades and grades , and about the hundred arts and trades and crafts and professions which men busy themselves in , but that he could TALK about the men and their grades and trades accurately , making no mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 22]: Maybe it is so , but have the experts spoken , or is it only Tom , Dick , and Harry ?
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 35]: Does the exhibit stand upon wide , and loose , and eloquent generalizing -- which is not evidence , and not proof -- or upon details , particulars , statistics , illustrations , demonstrations ?
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 32]: Experts of unchallengeable authority have testified definitely as to only one of Shakespeare 's multifarious craft-equipments , so far as my recollections of Shakespeare-Bacon talk abide with me -- his law-equipment .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 160]: I do not remember that Wellington or Napoleon ever examined Shakespeare 's battles and sieges and strategies , and then decided and established for good and all that they were militarily flawless ; I do not remember that any Nelson , or Drake , or Cook ever examined his seamanship and said it showed profound and accurate familiarity with that art ; I do n't remember that any king or prince or duke has ever testified that Shakespeare was letter-perfect in his handling of royal court-manners and the talk and manners of aristocracies ; I do n't remember that any illustrious Latinist or Grecian or Frenchman or Spaniard or Italian has proclaimed him a past-master in those languages ; I do n't remember -- well , I do n't remember that there is TESTIMONY -- great testimony -- imposing testimony -- unanswerable and unattackable testimony as to any of Shakespeare 's hundred specialties , except one -- the law .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 139]: Other things change , with time , and the student can not trace back with certainty the changes that various trades and their processes and technicalities have undergone in the long stretch of a century or two and find out what their processes and technicalities were in those early days , but with the law it is different : it is mile-stoned and documented all the way back , and the master of that wonderful trade , that complex and intricate trade , that awe-compelling trade , has competent ways of knowing whether Shakespeare-law is good law or not ; and whether his law-court procedure is correct or not , and whether his legal shop-talk is the shop-talk of a veteran practitioner or only a machine-made counterfeit of it gathered from books and from occasional loiterings in Westminster .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 29]: Richard H. Dana served two years before the mast , and had every experience that falls to the lot of the sailor before the mast of our day .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 36]: His sailor-talk flows from his pen with the sure touch and the ease and confidence of a person who has LIVED what he is talking about , not gathered it from books and random listenings .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 69]: Hear him : Having hove short , cast off the gaskets , and made the bunt of each sail fast by the jigger , with a man on each yard , at the word the whole canvas of the ship was loosed , and with the greatest rapidity possible everything was sheeted home and hoisted up , the anchor tripped and cat-headed , and the ship under headway .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 85]: Again : The royal yards were all crossed at once , and royals and sky-sails set , and , as we had the wind free , the booms were run out , and all were aloft , active as cats , laying out on the yards and booms , reeving the studding-sail gear ; and sail after sail the captain piled upon her , until she was covered with canvas , her sails looking like a great white cloud resting upon a black speck .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 3]: Once more .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 14]: A race in the Pacific : Our antagonist was in her best trim .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 68]: Being clear of the point , the breeze became stiff , and the royal-masts bent under our sails , but we would not take them in until we saw three boys spring into the rigging of the CALIFORNIA ; then they were all furled at once , but with orders to our boys to stay aloft at the top-gallant mast-heads and loose them again at the word .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 27]: It was my duty to furl the fore-royal ; and while standing by to loose it again , I had a fine view of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 45]: From where I stood , the two vessels seemed nothing but spars and sails , while their narrow decks , far below , slanting over by the force of the wind aloft , appeared hardly capable of supporting the great fabrics raised upon them .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 25]: The CALIFORNIA was to windward of us , and had every advantage ; yet , while the breeze was stiff we held our own .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 23]: As soon as it began to slacken she ranged a little ahead , and the order was given to loose the royals .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 12]: In an instant the gaskets were off and the bunt dropped .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 7]: `` Sheet home the fore-royal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 8]: -- `` Weather sheet 's home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 8]: -- `` Lee sheet 's home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 8]: -- `` Hoist away , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 5]: is bawled from aloft .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 6]: `` Overhaul your clew-lines ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 4]: shouts the mate .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 9]: `` Aye-aye , sir , all clear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 5]: -- `` Taut leech !
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 2]: belay !
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 11]: Well the lee brace ; haul taut to windward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 6]: and the royals are set .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 14]: What would the captain of any sailing-vessel of our time say to that ?
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 26]: He would say , `` The man that wrote that did n't learn his trade out of a book , he has BEEN there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 44]: But would this same captain be competent to sit in judgment upon Shakespeare 's seamanship -- considering the changes in ships and ship-talk that have necessarily taken place , unrecorded , unremembered , and lost to history in the last three hundred years ?
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 14]: It is my conviction that Shakespeare 's sailor-talk would be Choctaw to him .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 11]: For instance -- from `` The Tempest '' : MASTER .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 2]: Boatswain !
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 2]: BOATSWAIN .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 7]: Here , master ; what cheer ?
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 2]: MASTER .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 25]: Good , speak to the mariners : fall to ` t , yarely , or we run ourselves to ground ; bestir , bestir !
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 5]: -LRB- ENTER MARINERS . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 2]: BOATSWAIN .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 5]: Heigh , my hearts !
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 7]: cheerly , cheerly , my hearts !
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 4]: yare , yare !
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 5]: Take in the topsail .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 12]: Tend to the master 's whistle ... Down with the topmast !
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 2]: yare !
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 4]: lower , lower !
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 16]: Bring her to try wi ' the main course ... Lay her a-hold , a-hold !
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 5]: Set her two courses .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 9]: Off to sea again ; lay her off .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 20]: That will do , for the present ; let us yare a little , now , for a change .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 81]: If a man should write a book and in it make one of his characters say , `` Here , devil , empty the quoins into the standing galley and the imposing-stone into the hell-box ; assemble the comps around the frisket and let them jeff for takes and be quick about it , '' I should recognize a mistake or two in the phrasing , and would know that the writer was only a printer theoretically , not practically .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 146]: I have been a quartz miner in the silver regions -- a pretty hard life ; I know all the palaver of that business : I know all about discovery claims and the subordinate claims ; I know all about lodes , ledges , outcroppings , dips , spurs , angles , shafts , drifts , inclines , levels , tunnels , air-shafts , `` horses , '' clay casings , granite casings ; quartz mills and their batteries ; arastras , and how to charge them with quicksilver and sulphate of copper ; and how to clean them up , and how to reduce the resulting amalgam in the retorts , and how to cast the bullion into pigs ; and finally I know how to screen tailings , and also how to hunt for something less robust to do , and find it .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 60]: I know the argot and the quartz-mining and milling industry familiarly ; and so whenever Bret Harte introduces that industry into a story , the first time one of his miners opens his mouth I recognize from his phrasing that Harte got the phrasing by listening -- like Shakespeare -- I mean the Stratford one -- not by experience .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 20]: No one can talk the quartz dialect correctly without learning it with pick and shovel and drill and fuse .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 52]: I have been a surface miner -- gold -- and I know all its mysteries , and the dialects that belongs with them ; and whenever Harte introduces that industry into a story I know by the phrasing of his characters that neither he nor they have ever served that trade .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 32]: I have been a `` pocket '' miner -- a sort of gold mining not findable in any but one little spot in the world , so far as I know .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 51]: I know how , with horn and water , to find the trail of a pocket and trace it step by step and stage by stage up the mountain to its source , and find the compact little nest of yellow metal reposing in its secret home under the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 44]: I know the language of that trade , that capricious trade , that fascinating buried-treasure trade , and can catch any writer who tries to use it without having learned it by the sweat of his brow and the labor of his hands .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 47]: I know several other trades and the argot that goes with them ; and whenever a person tries to talk the talk peculiar to any of them without having learned it at its source I can trap him always before he gets far on his road .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 64]: And so , as I have already remarked , if I were required to superintend a Bacon-Shakespeare controversy , I would narrow the matter down to a single question -- the only one , so far as the previous controversies have informed me , concerning which illustrious experts of unimpeachable competency have testified : WAS THE AUTHOR OF SHAKESPEARE 'S WORKS A LAWYER ?
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 10]: -- a lawyer deeply read and of limitless experience ?
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 58]: I would put aside the guesses and surmises , and perhapses , and might-have-beens , and could-have-beens , and must-have-beens , and , we-are-justified-in-presumings , and the rest of those vague specters and shadows and indefintenesses , and stand or fall , win or lose , by the verdict rendered by the jury upon that single question .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 63]: If the verdict was Yes , I should feel quite convinced that the Stratford Shakespeare , the actor , manager , and trader who died so obscure , so forgotten , so destitute of even village consequence , that sixty years afterward no fellow-citizen and friend of his later days remembered to tell anything about him , did not write the Works .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 68]: Chapter XIII of THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM RESTATED bears the heading `` Shakespeare as a Lawyer , '' and comprises some fifty pages of expert testimony , with comments thereon , and I will copy the first nine , as being sufficient all by themselves , as it seems to me , to settle the question which I have conceived to be the master-key to the Shakespeare-Bacon puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 56]: VIII Shakespeare as a Lawyer -LRB- 1 -RRB- The Plays and Poems of Shakespeare supply ample evidence that their author not only had a very extensive and accurate knowledge of law , but that he was well acquainted with the manners and customs of members of the Inns of Court and with legal life generally .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 50]: `` While novelists and dramatists are constantly making mistakes as to the laws of marriage , of wills , of inheritance , to Shakespeare 's law , lavishly as he expounds it , there can neither be demurrer , nor bill of exceptions , nor writ of error . ''
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 36]: Such was the testimony borne by one of the most distinguished lawyers of the nineteenth century who was raised to the high office of Lord Chief Justice in 1850 , and subsequently became Lord Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 52]: Its weight will , doubtless , be more appreciated by lawyers than by laymen , for only lawyers know how impossible it is for those who have not served an apprenticeship to the law to avoid displaying their ignorance if they venture to employ legal terms and to discuss legal doctrines .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 27]: `` There is nothing so dangerous , '' wrote Lord Campbell , `` as for one not of the craft to tamper with our freemasonry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 18]: A layman is certain to betray himself by using some expression which a lawyer would never employ .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 12]: Mr. Sidney Lee himself supplies us with an example of this .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 36]: He writes -LRB- p. 164 -RRB- : `` On February 15 , 1609 , Shakespeare ... obtained judgment from a jury against Addenbroke for the payment of No. 6 , and No. 1 , 5s .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 2]: 0d .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 3]: costs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 47]: Now a lawyer would never have spoken of obtaining `` judgment from a jury , '' for it is the function of a jury not to deliver judgment -LRB- which is the prerogative of the court -RRB- , but to find a verdict on the facts .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 41]: The error is , indeed , a venial one , but it is just one of those little things which at once enable a lawyer to know if the writer is a layman or `` one of the craft . ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 24]: But when a layman ventures to plunge deeply into legal subjects , he is naturally apt to make an exhibition of his incompetence .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 43]: `` Let a non-professional man , however acute , '' writes Lord Campbell again , `` presume to talk law , or to draw illustrations from legal science in discussing other subjects , and he will speedily fall into laughable absurdity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 11]: And what does the same high authority say about Shakespeare ?
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 29]: He had `` a deep technical knowledge of the law , '' and an easy familiarity with `` some of the most abstruse proceedings in English jurisprudence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 17]: And again : `` Whenever he indulges this propensity he uniformly lays down good law . ''
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 46]: Of `` Henry IV. , '' Part 2 , he says : `` If Lord Eldon could be supposed to have written the play , I do not see how he could be chargeable with having forgotten any of his law while writing it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 38]: Charles and Mary Cowden Clarke speak of `` the marvelous intimacy which he displays with legal terms , his frequent adoption of them in illustration , and his curiously technical knowledge of their form and force . ''
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 41]: Malone , himself a lawyer , wrote : `` His knowledge of legal terms is not merely such as might be acquired by the casual observation of even his all-comprehending mind ; it has the appearance of technical skill . ''
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 61]: Another lawyer and well-known Shakespearean , Richard Grant White , says : `` No dramatist of the time , not even Beaumont , who was the younger son of a judge of the Common Pleas , and who after studying in the Inns of Court abandoned law for the drama , used legal phrases with Shakespeare 's readiness and exactness .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 26]: And the significance of this fact is heightened by another , that is only to the language of the law that he exhibits this inclination .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 48]: The phrases peculiar to other occupations serve him on rare occasions by way of description , comparison , or illustration , generally when something in the scene suggests them , but legal phrases flow from his pen as part of his vocabulary and parcel of his thought .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 70]: Take the word ` purchase ' for instance , which , in ordinary use , means to acquire by giving value , but applies in law to all legal modes of obtaining property except by inheritance or descent , and in this peculiar sense the word occurs five times in Shakespeare 's thirty-four plays , and only in one single instance in the fifty-four plays of Beaumont and Fletcher .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 22]: It has been suggested that it was in attendance upon the courts in London that he picked up his legal vocabulary .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 124]: But this supposition not only fails to account for Shakespeare 's peculiar freedom and exactness in the use of that phraseology , it does not even place him in the way of learning those terms his use of which is most remarkable , which are not such as he would have heard at ordinary proceedings at NISI PRIUS , but such as refer to the tenure or transfer of real property , ` fine and recovery , ' ` statutes merchant , ' ` purchase , ' ` indenture , ' ` tenure , ' ` double voucher , ' ` fee simple , ' ` fee farm , ' ` remainder , ' ` reversion , ' ` forfeiture , ' etc. .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 39]: This conveyancer 's jargon could not have been picked up by hanging round the courts of law in London two hundred and fifty years ago , when suits as to the title of real property were comparatively rare .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 31]: And besides , Shakespeare uses his law just as freely in his first plays , written in his first London years , as in those produced at a later period .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 31]: Just as exactly , too ; for the correctness and propriety with which these terms are introduced have compelled the admiration of a Chief Justice and a Lord Chancellor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 26]: Senator Davis wrote : `` We seem to have something more than a sciolist 's temerity of indulgence in the terms of an unfamiliar art .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 7]: No legal solecisms will be found .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 14]: The abstrusest elements of the common law are impressed into a disciplined service .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 25]: Over and over again , where such knowledge is unexampled in writers unlearned in the law , Shakespeare appears in perfect possession of it .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 131]: In the law of real property , its rules of tenure and descents , its entails , its fines and recoveries , their vouchers and double vouchers , in the procedure of the Courts , the method of bringing writs and arrests , the nature of actions , the rules of pleading , the law of escapes and of contempt of court , in the principles of evidence , both technical and philosophical , in the distinction between the temporal and spiritual tribunals , in the law of attainder and forfeiture , in the requisites of a valid marriage , in the presumption of legitimacy , in the learning of the law of prerogative , in the inalienable character of the Crown , this mastership appears with surprising authority . ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 86]: To all this testimony -LRB- and there is much more which I have not cited -RRB- may now be added that of a great lawyer of our own times , VIZ. : Sir James Plaisted Wilde , Q.C. 1855 , created a Baron of the Exchequer in 1860 , promoted to the post of Judge-Ordinary and Judge of the Courts of Probate and Divorce in 1863 , and better known to the world as Lord Penzance , to which dignity he was raised in 1869 .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 65]: Lord Penzance , as all lawyers know , and as the late Mr. Inderwick , K.C. , has testified , was one of the first legal authorities of his day , famous for his `` remarkable grasp of legal principles , '' and `` endowed by nature with a remarkable facility for marshaling facts , and for a clear expression of his views . ''
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 68]: Lord Penzance speaks of Shakespeare 's `` perfect familiarity with not only the principles , axioms , and maxims , but the technicalities of English law , a knowledge so perfect and intimate that he was never incorrect and never at fault ... The mode in which this knowledge was pressed into service on all occasions to express his meaning and illustrate his thoughts was quite unexampled .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 21]: He seems to have had a special pleasure in his complete and ready mastership of it in all its branches .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 42]: As manifested in the plays , this legal knowledge and learning had therefore a special character which places it on a wholly different footing from the rest of the multifarious knowledge which is exhibited in page after page of the plays .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 27]: At every turn and point at which the author required a metaphor , simile , or illustration , his mind ever turned FIRST to the law .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 28]: He seems almost to have THOUGHT in legal phrases , the commonest of legal expressions were ever at the end of his pen in description or illustration .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 70]: That he should have descanted in lawyer language when he had a forensic subject in hand , such as Shylock 's bond , was to be expected , but the knowledge of law in ` Shakespeare ' was exhibited in a far different manner : it protruded itself on all occasions , appropriate or inappropriate , and mingled itself with strains of thought widely divergent from forensic subjects . ''
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 65]: Again : `` To acquire a perfect familiarity with legal principles , and an accurate and ready use of the technical terms and phrases not only of the conveyancer 's office , but of the pleader 's chambers and the Courts at Westminster , nothing short of employment in some career involving constant contact with legal questions and general legal work would be requisite .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 26]: But a continuous employment involves the element of time , and time was just what the manager of two theaters had not at his disposal .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 42]: In what portion of Shakespeare 's -LRB- i.e. , Shakspere 's -RRB- career would it be possible to point out that time could be found for the interposition of a legal employment in the chambers or offices of practicing lawyers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 46]: Stratfordians , as is well known , casting about for some possible explanation of Shakespeare 's extraordinary knowledge of law , have made the suggestion that Shakespeare might , conceivably , have been a clerk in an attorney 's office before he came to London .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 19]: Mr. Collier wrote to Lord Campbell to ask his opinion as to the probability of this being true .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 38]: His answer was as follows : `` You require us to believe implicitly a fact , of which , if true , positive and irrefragable evidence in his own handwriting might have been forthcoming to establish it .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 72]: Not having been actually enrolled as an attorney , neither the records of the local court at Stratford nor of the superior Court at Westminster would present his name as being concerned in any suit as an attorney , but it might reasonably have been expected that there would be deeds or wills witnessed by him still extant , and after a very diligent search none such can be discovered . ''
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 20]: Upon this Lord Penzance commends : `` It can not be doubted that Lord Campbell was right in this .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 38]: No young man could have been at work in an attorney 's office without being called upon continually to act as a witness , and in many other ways leaving traces of his work and name . ''
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 30]: There is not a single fact or incident in all that is known of Shakespeare , even by rumor or tradition , which supports this notion of a clerkship .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 59]: And after much argument and surmise which has been indulged in on this subject , we may , I think , safely put the notion on one side , for no less an authority than Mr. Grant White says finally that the idea of his having been clerk to an attorney has been `` blown to pieces . ''
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 18]: It is altogether characteristic of Mr. Churton Collins that he , nevertheless , adopts this exploded myth .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 20]: `` That Shakespeare was in early life employed as a clerk in an attorney 's office may be correct .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 50]: At Stratford there was by royal charter a Court of Record sitting every fortnight , with six attorneys , besides the town clerk , belonging to it , and it is certainly not straining probability to suppose that the young Shakespeare may have had employment in one of them .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 47]: There is , it is true , no tradition to this effect , but such traditions as we have about Shakespeare 's occupation between the time of leaving school and going to London are so loose and baseless that no confidence can be placed in them .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 40]: It is , to say the least , more probable that he was in an attorney 's office than that he was a butcher killing calves ` in a high style , ' and making speeches over them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 9]: This is a charming specimen of Stratfordian argument .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 20]: There is , as we have seen , a very old tradition that Shakespeare was a butcher 's apprentice .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 39]: John Dowdall , who made a tour of Warwickshire in 1693 , testifies to it as coming from the old clerk who showed him over the church , and it is unhesitatingly accepted as true by Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 3]: -LRB- Vol .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 8]: I , p. 11 , and Vol .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 8]: II , pp. 71 , 72 . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 33]: Mr. Sidney Lee sees nothing improbable in it , and it is supported by Aubrey , who must have written his account some time before 1680 , when his manuscript was completed .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 22]: Of the attorney 's clerk hypothesis , on the other hand , there is not the faintest vestige of a tradition .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 33]: It has been evolved out of the fertile imaginations of embarrassed Stratfordians , seeking for some explanation of the Stratford rustic 's marvelous acquaintance with law and legal terms and legal life .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 105]: But Mr. Churton Collins has not the least hesitation in throwing over the tradition which has the warrant of antiquity and setting up in its stead this ridiculous invention , for which not only is there no shred of positive evidence , but which , as Lord Campbell and Lord Penzance pointed out , is really put out of court by the negative evidence , since `` no young man could have been at work in an attorney 's office without being called upon continually to act as a witness , and in many other ways leaving traces of his work and name . ''
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 74]: And as Mr. Edwards further points out , since the day when Lord Campbell 's book was published -LRB- between forty and fifty years ago -RRB- , `` every old deed or will , to say nothing of other legal papers , dated during the period of William Shakespeare 's youth , has been scrutinized over half a dozen shires , and not one signature of the young man has been found . ''
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 52]: Moreover , if Shakespeare had served as clerk in an attorney 's office it is clear that he must have served for a considerable period in order to have gained -LRB- if , indeed , it is credible that he could have so gained -RRB- his remarkable knowledge of the law .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 25]: Can we then for a moment believe that , if this had been so , tradition would have been absolutely silent on the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 43]: That Dowdall 's old clerk , over eighty years of age , should have never heard of it -LRB- though he was sure enough about the butcher 's apprentice -RRB- and that all the other ancient witnesses should be in similar ignorance !
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 9]: But such are the methods of Stratfordian controversy .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 22]: Tradition is to be scouted when it is found inconvenient , but cited as irrefragable truth when it suits the case .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 29]: Shakespeare of Stratford was the author of the Plays and Poems , but the author of the Plays and Poems could not have been a butcher 's apprentice .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 7]: Anyway , therefore , with tradition .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 23]: But the author of the Plays and Poems MUST have had a very large and a very accurate knowledge of the law .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 13]: Therefore , Shakespeare of Stratford must have been an attorney 's clerk !
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 6]: The method is simplicity itself .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 39]: By similar reasoning Shakespeare has been made a country schoolmaster , a soldier , a physician , a printer , and a good many other things besides , according to the inclination and the exigencies of the commentator .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 30]: It would not be in the least surprising to find that he was studying Latin as a schoolmaster and law in an attorney 's office at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 33]: However , we must do Mr. Collins the justice of saying that he has fully recognized , what is indeed tolerable obvious , that Shakespeare must have had a sound legal training .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 51]: `` It may , of course , be urged , '' he writes , `` that Shakespeare 's knowledge of medicine , and particularly that branch of it which related to morbid psychology , is equally remarkable , and that no one has ever contended that he was a physician .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 16]: -LRB- Here Mr. Collins is wrong ; that contention also has been put forward . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 42]: It may be urged that his acquaintance with the technicalities of other crafts and callings , notably of marine and military affairs , was also extraordinary , and yet no one has suspected him of being a sailor or a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 4]: -LRB- Wrong again .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 17]: Why , even Messrs. Garnett and Gosse `` suspect '' that he was a soldier ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 13]: This may be conceded , but the concession hardly furnishes an analogy .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 32]: To these and all other subjects he recurs occasionally , and in season , but with reminiscences of the law his memory , as is abundantly clear , was simply saturated .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 26]: In season and out of season now in manifest , now in recondite application , he presses it into the service of expression and illustration .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 13]: At least a third of his myriad metaphors are derived from it .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 39]: It would indeed be difficult to find a single act in any of his dramas , nay , in some of them , a single scene , the diction and imagery of which are not colored by it .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 72]: Much of his law may have been acquired from three books easily accessible to him -- namely , Tottell 's PRECEDENTS -LRB- 1572 -RRB- , Pulton 's STATUTES -LRB- 1578 -RRB- , and Fraunce 's LAWIER 'S LOGIKE -LRB- 1588 -RRB- , works with which he certainly seems to have been familiar ; but much of it could only have come from one who had an intimate acquaintance with legal proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 62]: We quite agree with Mr. Castle that Shakespeare 's legal knowledge is not what could have been picked up in an attorney 's office , but could only have been learned by an actual attendance at the Courts , at a Pleader 's Chambers , and on circuit , or by associating intimately with members of the Bench and Bar . ''
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 4]: This is excellent .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 8]: But what is Mr. Collins 's explanation ?
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 27]: `` Perhaps the simplest solution of the problem is to accept the hypothesis that in early life he was in an attorney 's office -LRB- ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 51]: , that he there contracted a love for the law which never left him , that as a young man in London he continued to study or dabble in it for his amusement , to stroll in leisure hours into the Courts , and to frequent the society of lawyers .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 54]: On no other supposition is it possible to explain the attraction which the law evidently had for him , and his minute and undeviating accuracy in a subject where no layman who has indulged in such copious and ostentatious display of legal technicalities has ever yet succeeded in keeping himself from tripping . ''
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 4]: A lame conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 7]: `` No other supposition '' indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 51]: Yes , there is another , and a very obvious supposition -- namely , that Shakespeare was himself a lawyer , well versed in his trade , versed in all the ways of the courts , and living in close intimacy with judges and members of the Inns of Court .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 161]: One is , of course , thankful that Mr. Collins has appreciated the fact that Shakespeare must have had a sound legal training , but I may be forgiven if I do not attach quite so much importance to his pronouncements on this branch of the subject as to those of Malone , Lord Campbell , Judge Holmes , Mr. Castle , K.C. , Lord Penzance , Mr. Grant White , and other lawyers , who have expressed their opinion on the matter of Shakespeare 's legal acquirements ... Here it may , perhaps , be worth while to quote again from Lord Penzance 's book as to the suggestion that Shakespeare had somehow or other managed `` to acquire a perfect familiarity with legal principles , and an accurate and ready use of the technical terms and phrases , not only of the conveyancer 's office , but of the pleader 's chambers and the Courts at Westminster . ''
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 30]: This , as Lord Penzance points out , `` would require nothing short of employment in some career involving CONSTANT CONTACT with legal questions and general legal work . ''
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 37]: But `` in what portion of Shakespeare 's career would it be possible to point out that time could be found for the interposition of a legal employment in the chambers or offices of practicing lawyers ?
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 42]: ... It is beyond doubt that at an early period he was called upon to abandon his attendance at school and assist his father , and was soon after , at the age of sixteen , bound apprentice to a trade .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 16]: While under the obligation of this bond he could not have pursued any other employment .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 9]: Then he leaves Stratford and comes to London .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 23]: He has to provide himself with the means of a livelihood , and this he did in some capacity at the theater .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 5]: No one doubts that .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 57]: The holding of horses is scouted by many , and perhaps with justice , as being unlikely and certainly unproved ; but whatever the nature of his employment was at the theater , there is hardly room for the belief that it could have been other than continuous , for his progress there was so rapid .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 25]: Ere long he had been taken into the company as an actor , and was soon spoken of as a ` Johannes Factotum . '
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 16]: His rapid accumulation of wealth speaks volumes for the constancy and activity of his services .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 34]: One fails to see when there could be a break in the current of his life at this period of it , giving room or opportunity for legal or indeed any other employment .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 56]: ` In 1589 , ' says Knight , ` we have undeniable evidence that he had not only a casual engagement , was not only a salaried servant , as may players were , but was a shareholder in the company of the Queen 's players with other shareholders below him on the list . '
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 27]: This -LRB- 1589 -RRB- would be within two years after his arrival in London , which is placed by White and Halliwell-Phillipps about the year 1587 .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 45]: The difficulty in supposing that , starting with a state of ignorance in 1587 , when he is supposed to have come to London , he was induced to enter upon a course of most extended study and mental culture , is almost insuperable .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 19]: Still it was physically possible , provided always that he could have had access to the needful books .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 14]: But this legal training seems to me to stand on a different footing .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 22]: It is not only unaccountable and incredible , but it is actually negatived by the known facts of his career . ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 30]: Lord Penzance then refers to the fact that `` by 1592 -LRB- according to the best authority , Mr. Grant White -RRB- several of the plays had been written .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 136]: ` The Comedy of Errors ' in 1589 , ` Love 's Labour 's Lost ' in 1589 , ` Two Gentlemen of Verona ' in 1589 or 1590 , '' and so forth , and then asks , `` with this catalogue of dramatic work on hand ... was it possible that he could have taken a leading part in the management and conduct of two theaters , and if Mr. Phillipps is to be relied upon , taken his share in the performances of the provincial tours of his company -- and at the same time devoted himself to the study of the law in all its branches so efficiently as to make himself complete master of its principles and practice , and saturate his mind with all its most technical terms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 96]: I have cited this passage from Lord Penzance 's book , because it lay before me , and I had already quoted from it on the matter of Shakespeare 's legal knowledge ; but other writers have still better set forth the insuperable difficulties , as they seem to me , which beset the idea that Shakespeare might have found them in some unknown period of early life , amid multifarious other occupations , for the study of classics , literature , and law , to say nothing of languages and a few other matters .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 62]: Lord Penzance further asks his readers : `` Did you ever meet with or hear of an instance in which a young man in this country gave himself up to legal studies and engaged in legal employments , which is the only way of becoming familiar with the technicalities of practice , unless with the view of practicing in that profession ?
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 43]: I do not believe that it would be easy , or indeed possible , to produce an instance in which the law has been seriously studied in all its branches , except as a qualification for practice in the legal profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 85]: This testimony is so strong , so direct , so authoritative ; and so uncheapened , unwatered by guesses , and surmises , and maybe-so 's , and might-have-beens , and could-have-beens , and must-have-beens , and the rest of that ton of plaster of Paris out of which the biographers have built the colossal brontosaur which goes by the Stratford actor 's name , that it quite convinces me that the man who wrote Shakespeare 's Works knew all about law and lawyers .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 17]: Also , that that man could not have been the Stratford Shakespeare -- and WAS N'T .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 8]: Who did write these Works , then ?
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 5]: I wish I knew .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 9]: From Chapter XIII of THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM RESTATED .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 12]: By George G. Greenwood , M.P. John Lane Company , publishers .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 9]: IX Did Francis Bacon write Shakespeare 's Works ?
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 3]: Nobody knows .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 16]: We can not say we KNOW a thing when that thing has not been proved .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 18]: KNOW is too strong a word to use when the evidence is not final and absolutely conclusive .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 32]: We can infer , if we want to , like those slaves ... No , I will not write that word , it is not kind , it is not courteous .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 54]: The upholders of the Stratford-Shakespeare superstition call US the hardest names they can think of , and they keep doing it all the time ; very well , if they like to descend to that level , let them do it , but I will not so undignify myself as to follow them .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 31]: I can not call them harsh names ; the most I can do is to indicate them by terms reflecting my disapproval ; and this without malice , without venom .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 3]: To resume .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 25]: What I was about to say was , those thugs have built their entire superstition upon INFERENCES , not upon known and established facts .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 33]: It is a weak method , and poor , and I am glad to be able to say our side never resorts to it while there is anything else to resort to .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 37]: But when we must , we must ; and we have now arrived at a place of that sort ... Since the Stratford Shakespeare could n't have written the Works , we infer that somebody did .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 6]: Who was it , then ?
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 6]: This requires some more inferring .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 41]: Ordinarily when an unsigned poem sweeps across the continent like a tidal wave whose roar and boom and thunder are made up of admiration , delight , and applause , a dozen obscure people rise up and claim the authorship .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 11]: Why a dozen , instead of only one or two ?
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 18]: One reason is , because there are a dozen that are recognizably competent to do that poem .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 8]: Do you remember `` Beautiful Snow '' ?
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 17]: Do you remember `` Rock Me to Sleep , Mother , Rock Me to Sleep '' ?
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 17]: Do you remember `` Backward , turn , backward , O Time , in thy flight !
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 10]: Make me a child again just for tonight '' ?
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 6]: I remember them very well .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 45]: Their authorship was claimed by most of the grown-up people who were alive at the time , and every claimant had one plausible argument in his favor , at least -- to wit , he could have done the authoring ; he was competent .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 9]: Have the Works been claimed by a dozen ?
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 4]: They have n't .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 5]: There was good reason .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 26]: The world knows there was but one man on the planet at the time who was competent -- not a dozen , and not two .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 57]: A long time ago the dwellers in a far country used now and then to find a procession of prodigious footprints stretching across the plain -- footprints that were three miles apart , each footprint a third of a mile long and a furlong deep , and with forests and villages mashed to mush in it .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 12]: Was there any doubt as to who made that mighty trail ?
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 6]: Were there a dozen claimants ?
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 4]: Where there two ?
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 20]: No -- the people knew who it was that had been along there : there was only one Hercules .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 7]: There has been only one Shakespeare .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 17]: There could n't be two ; certainly there could n't be two at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 17]: It takes ages to bring forth a Shakespeare , and some more ages to match him .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 21]: This one was not matched before his time ; nor during his time ; and has n't been matched since .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 12]: The prospect of matching him in our time is not bright .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 21]: The Baconians claim that the Stratford Shakespeare was not qualified to write the Works , and that Francis Bacon was .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 39]: They claim that Bacon possessed the stupendous equipment -- both natural and acquired -- for the miracle ; and that no other Englishman of his day possessed the like ; or , indeed , anything closely approaching it .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 20]: Macaulay , in his Essay , has much to say about the splendor and horizonless magnitude of that equipment .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 30]: Also , he has synopsized Bacon 's history -- a thing which can not be done for the Stratford Shakespeare , for he has n't any history to synopsize .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 42]: Bacon 's history is open to the world , from his boyhood to his death in old age -- a history consisting of known facts , displayed in minute and multitudinous detail ; FACTS , not guesses and conjectures and might-have-beens .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 67]: Whereby it appears that he was born of a race of statesmen , and had a Lord Chancellor for his father , and a mother who was `` distinguished both as a linguist and a theologian : she corresponded in Greek with Bishop Jewell , and translated his APOLOGIA from the Latin so correctly that neither he nor Archbishop Parker could suggest a single alteration . ''
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 18]: It is the atmosphere we are reared in that determines how our inclinations and aspirations shall tend .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 33]: The atmosphere furnished by the parents to the son in this present case was an atmosphere saturated with learning ; with thinkings and ponderings upon deep subjects ; and with polite culture .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 6]: It had its natural effect .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 26]: Shakespeare of Stratford was reared in a house which had no use for books , since its owners , his parents , were without education .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 28]: This may have had an effect upon the son , but we do not know , because we have no history of him of an informing sort .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 30]: There were but few books anywhere , in that day , and only the well-to-do and highly educated possessed them , they being almost confined to the dead languages .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 26]: `` All the valuable books then extant in all the vernacular dialects of Europe would hardly have filled a single shelf '' -- imagine it !
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 11]: The few existing books were in the Latin tongue mainly .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 89]: `` A person who was ignorant of it was shut out from all acquaintance -- not merely with Cicero and Virgil , but with the most interesting memoirs , state papers , and pamphlets of his own time '' -- a literature necessary to the Stratford lad , for his fictitious reputation 's sake , since the writer of his Works would begin to use it wholesale and in a most masterly way before the lad was hardly more than out of his teens and into his twenties .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 16]: At fifteen Bacon was sent to the university , and he spent three years there .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 39]: Thence he went to Paris in the train of the English Ambassador , and there he mingled daily with the wise , the cultured , the great , and the aristocracy of fashion , during another three years .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 20]: A total of six years spent at the sources of knowledge ; knowledge both of books and of men .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 41]: The three spent at the university were coeval with the second and last three spent by the little Stratford lad at Stratford school supposedly , and perhapsedly , and maybe , and by inference -- with nothing to infer from .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 22]: The second three of the Baconian six were `` presumably '' spent by the Stratford lad as apprentice to a butcher .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 15]: That is , the thugs presume it -- on no evidence of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 12]: Which is their way , when they want a historical fact .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 15]: Fact and presumption are , for business purposes , all the same to them .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 14]: They know the difference , but they also know how to blink it .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 37]: They know , too , that while in history-building a fact is better than a presumption , it does n't take a presumption long to bloom into a fact when THEY have the handling of it .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 83]: They know by old experience that when they get hold of a presumption-tadpole he is not going to STAY tadpole in their history-tank ; no , they know how to develop him into the giant four-legged bullfrog of FACT , and make him sit up on his hams , and puff out his chin , and look important and insolent and come-to-stay ; and assert his genuine simon-pure authenticity with a thundering bellow that will convince everybody because it is so loud .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 15]: The thug is aware that loudness convinces sixty persons where reasoning convinces but one .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 35]: I would n't be a thug , not even if -- but never mind about that , it has nothing to do with the argument , and it is not noble in spirit besides .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 13]: If I am better than a thug , is the merit mine ?
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 6]: No , it is His .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 7]: Then to Him be the praise .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 6]: That is the right spirit .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 23]: They `` presume '' the lad severed his `` presumed '' connection with the Stratford school to become apprentice to a butcher .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 12]: They also `` presume '' that the butcher was his father .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 5]: They do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 14]: There is no written record of it , nor any other actual evidence .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 37]: If it would have helped their case any , they would have apprenticed him to thirty butchers , to fifty butchers , to a wilderness of butchers -- all by their patented method `` presumption . ''
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 33]: If it will help their case they will do it yet ; and if it will further help it , they will `` presume '' that all those butchers were his father .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 10]: And the week after , they will SAY it .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 35]: Why , it is just like being the past tense of the compound reflexive adverbial incandescent hypodermic irregular accusative Noun of Multitude ; which is father to the expression which the grammarians call Verb .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 12]: It is like a whole ancestry , with only one posterity .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 3]: To resume .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 18]: Next , the young Bacon took up the study of law , and mastered that abstruse science .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 120]: From that day to the end of his life he was daily in close contact with lawyers and judges ; not as a casual onlooker in intervals between holding horses in front of a theater , but as a practicing lawyer -- a great and successful one , a renowned one , a Launcelot of the bar , the most formidable lance in the high brotherhood of the legal Table Round ; he lived in the law 's atmosphere thenceforth , all his years , and by sheer ability forced his way up its difficult steeps to its supremest summit , the Lord-Chancellorship , leaving behind him no fellow-craftsman qualified to challenge his divine right to that majestic place .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 87]: When we read the praises bestowed by Lord Penzance and the other illustrious experts upon the legal condition and legal aptnesses , brilliances , profundities , and felicities so prodigally displayed in the Plays , and try to fit them to the historyless Stratford stage-manager , they sound wild , strange , incredible , ludicrous ; but when we put them in the mouth of Bacon they do not sound strange , they seem in their natural and rightful place , they seem at home there .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 8]: Please turn back and read them again .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 67]: Attributed to Shakespeare of Stratford they are meaningless , they are inebriate extravagancies -- intemperate admirations of the dark side of the moon , so to speak ; attributed to Bacon , they are admirations of the golden glories of the moon 's front side , the moon at the full -- and not intemperate , not overwrought , but sane and right , and justified .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 59]: `` At ever turn and point at which the author required a metaphor , simile , or illustration , his mind ever turned FIRST to the law ; he seems almost to have THOUGHT in legal phrases ; the commonest legal phrases , the commonest of legal expressions , were ever at the end of his pen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 25]: That could happen to no one but a person whose TRADE was the law ; it could not happen to a dabbler in it .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 54]: Veteran mariners fill their conversation with sailor-phrases and draw all their similes from the ship and the sea and the storm , but no mere PASSENGER ever does it , be he of Stratford or elsewhere ; or could do it with anything resembling accuracy , if he were hardy enough to try .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 27]: Please read again what Lord Campbell and the other great authorities have said about Bacon when they thought they were saying it about Shakespeare of Stratford .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 40]: X The Rest of the Equipment The author of the Plays was equipped , beyond every other man of his time , with wisdom , erudition , imagination , capaciousness of mind , grace , and majesty of expression .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 11]: Everyone one had said it , no one doubts it .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 18]: Also , he had humor , humor in rich abundance , and always wanting to break out .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 22]: We have no evidence of any kind that Shakespeare of Stratford possessed any of these gifts or any of these acquirements .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 25]: The only lines he ever wrote , so far as we know , are substantially barren of them -- barren of all of them .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 30]: Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare : Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my bones .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 26]: Ben Jonson says of Bacon , as orator : His language , WHERE HE COULD SPARE AND PASS BY A JEST , was nobly censorious .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 26]: No man ever spoke more neatly , more pressly , more weightily , or suffered less emptiness , less idleness , in what he uttered .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 31]: No member of his speech but consisted of his -LRB- its -RRB- own graces ... The fear of every man that heard him was lest he should make an end .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 37]: From Macaulay : He continued to distinguish himself in Parliament , particularly by his exertions in favor of one excellent measure on which the King 's heart was set -- the union of England and Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 20]: It was not difficult for such an intellect to discover many irresistible arguments in favor of such a scheme .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 52]: He conducted the great case of the POST NATI in the Exchequer Chamber ; and the decision of the judges -- a decision the legality of which may be questioned , but the beneficial effect of which must be acknowledged -- was in a great measure attributed to his dexterous management .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 26]: Again : While actively engaged in the House of Commons and in the courts of law , he still found leisure for letters and philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 25]: The noble treatise on the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING , which at a later period was expanded into the DE AUGMENTIS , appeared in 1605 .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 36]: The WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS , a work which , if it had proceeded from any other writer , would have been considered as a masterpiece of wit and learning , was printed in 1609 .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 11]: In the mean time the NOVUM ORGANUM was slowly proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 27]: Several distinguished men of learning had been permitted to see portions of that extraordinary book , and they spoke with the greatest admiration of his genius .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 90]: Even Sir Thomas Bodley , after perusing the COGITATA ET VISA , one of the most precious of those scattered leaves out of which the great oracular volume was afterward made up , acknowledged that `` in all proposals and plots in that book , Bacon showed himself a master workman '' ; and that `` it could not be gainsaid but all the treatise over did abound with choice conceits of the present state of learning , and with worthy contemplations of the means to procure it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 22]: In 1612 a new edition of the ESSAYS appeared , with additions surpassing the original collection both in bulk and quality .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 53]: Nor did these pursuits distract Bacon 's attention from a work the most arduous , the most glorious , and the most useful that even his mighty powers could have achieved , `` the reducing and recompiling , '' to use his own phrase , `` of the laws of England . ''
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 40]: To serve the exacting and laborious offices of Attorney-General and Solicitor-General would have satisfied the appetite of any other man for hard work , but Bacon had to add the vast literary industries just described , to satisfy his .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 6]: He was a born worker .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 61]: The service which he rendered to letters during the last five years of his life , amid ten thousand distractions and vexations , increase the regret with which we think on the many years which he had wasted , to use the words of Sir Thomas Bodley , `` on such study as was not worthy such a student . ''
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 33]: He commenced a digest of the laws of England , a History of England under the Princes of the House of Tudor , a body of National History , a Philosophical Romance .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 10]: He made extensive and valuable additions to his Essays .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 9]: He published the inestimable TREATISE DE AUGMENTIS SCIENTIARUM .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 20]: Did these labors of Hercules fill up his time to his contentment , and quiet his appetite for work ?
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 23]: Not entirely : The trifles with which he amused himself in hours of pain and languor bore the mark of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 34]: THE BEST JEST-BOOK IN THE WORLD is that which he dictated from memory , without referring to any book , on a day on which illness had rendered him incapable of serious study .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 59]: Here are some scattered remarks -LRB- from Macaulay -RRB- which throw light upon Bacon , and seem to indicate -- and maybe demonstrate -- that he was competent to write the Plays and Poems : With great minuteness of observation he had an amplitude of comprehension such as has never yet been vouchsafed to any other human being .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 47]: The ESSAYS contain abundant proofs that no nice feature of character , no peculiarity in the ordering of a house , a garden , or a court-masque , could escape the notice of one whose mind was capable of taking in the whole world of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 45]: His understanding resembled the tent which the fairy Paribanou gave to Prince Ahmed : fold it , and it seemed a toy for the hand of a lady ; spread it , and the armies of the powerful Sultans might repose beneath its shade .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 21]: The knowledge in which Bacon excelled all men was a knowledge of the mutual relations of all departments of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 32]: In a letter written when he was only thirty-one , to his uncle , Lord Burleigh , he said , `` I have taken all knowledge to be my province . ''
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 25]: Though Bacon did not arm his philosophy with the weapons of logic , he adorned her profusely with all the richest decorations of rhetoric .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 34]: The practical faculty was powerful in Bacon ; but not , like his wit , so powerful as occasionally to usurp the place of his reason and to tyrannize over the whole man .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 12]: There are too many places in the Plays where this happens .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 21]: Poor old dying John of Gaunt volleying second-rate puns at his own name , is a pathetic instance of it .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 22]: `` We may assume '' that it is Bacon 's fault , but the Stratford Shakespeare has to bear the blame .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 13]: No imagination was ever at once so strong and so thoroughly subjugated .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 10]: It stopped at the first check from good sense .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 76]: In truth , much of Bacon 's life was passed in a visionary world -- amid things as strange as any that are described in the ARABIAN TALES ... amid buildings more sumptuous than the palace of Aladdin , fountains more wonderful than the golden water of Parizade , conveyances more rapid than the hippogryph of Ruggiero , arms more formidable than the lance of Astolfo , remedies more efficacious than the balsam of Fierabras .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 17]: Yet in his magnificent day-dreams there was nothing wild -- nothing but what sober reason sanctioned .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 14]: Bacon 's greatest performance is the first book of the NOVUM ORGANUM ... .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 21]: Every part of it blazes with wit , but with wit which is employed only to illustrate and decorate truth .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 25]: No book ever made so great a revolution in the mode of thinking , overthrew so may prejudices , introduced so many new opinions .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 63]: But what we most admire is the vast capacity of that intellect which , without effort , takes in at once all the domains of science -- all the past , the present and the future , all the errors of two thousand years , all the encouraging signs of the passing times , all the bright hopes of the coming age .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 14]: He had a wonderful talent for packing thought close and rendering it portable .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 14]: His eloquence would alone have entitled him to a high rank in literature .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 53]: It is evident that he had each and every one of the mental gifts and each and every one of the acquirements that are so prodigally displayed in the Plays and Poems , and in much higher and richer degree than any other man of his time or of any previous time .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 13]: He was a genius without a mate , a prodigy not matable .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 24]: There was only one of him ; the planet could not produce two of him at one birth , nor in one age .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 13]: He could have written anything that is in the Plays and Poems .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 48]: He could have written this : The cloud-cap 'd towers , the gorgeous palaces , The solemn temples , the great globe itself , Yea , all which it inherit , shall dissolve , And , like an insubstantial pageant faded , Leave not a rack behind .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 20]: We are such stuff As dreams are made of , and our little life Is rounded with a sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 42]: Also , he could have written this , but he refrained : Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare : Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my bones .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 45]: When a person reads the noble verses about the cloud-cap 'd towers , he ought not to follow it immediately with Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare , because he will find the transition from great poetry to poor prose too violent for comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 7]: It will give him a shock .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 21]: You never notice how commonplace and unpoetic gravel is until you bite into a layer of it in a pie .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 16]: XI Am I trying to convince anybody that Shakespeare did not write Shakespeare 's Works ?
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 11]: Ah , now , what do you take me for ?
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 20]: Would I be so soft as that , after having known the human race familiarly for nearly seventy-four years ?
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 24]: It would grieve me to know that any one could think so injuriously of me , so uncomplimentarily , so unadmiringly of me .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 69]: No , no , I am aware that when even the brightest mind in our world has been trained up from childhood in a superstition of any kind , it will never be possible for that mind , in its maturity , to examine sincerely , dispassionately , and conscientiously any evidence or any circumstance which shall seem to cast a doubt upon the validity of that superstition .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 9]: I doubt if I could do it myself .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 111]: We always get at second hand our notions about systems of government ; and high tariff and low tariff ; and prohibition and anti-prohibition ; and the holiness of peace and the glories of war ; and codes of honor and codes of morals ; and approval of the duel and disapproval of it ; and our beliefs concerning the nature of cats ; and our ideas as to whether the murder of helpless wild animals is base or is heroic ; and our preferences in the matter of religious and political parties ; and our acceptance or rejection of the Shakespeares and the Author Ortons and the Mrs. Eddys .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 17]: We get them all at second hand , we reason none of them out for ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 8]: It is the way we are made .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 22]: It is the way we are all made , and we ca n't help it , we ca n't change it .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 55]: And whenever we have been furnished a fetish , and have been taught to believe in it , and love it and worship it , and refrain from examining it , there is no evidence , howsoever clear and strong , that can persuade us to withdraw from it our loyalty and our devotion .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 30]: In morals , conduct , and beliefs we take the color of our environment and associations , and it is a color that can safely be warranted to wash .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 39]: Whenever we have been furnished with a tar baby ostensibly stuffed with jewels , and warned that it will be dishonorable and irreverent to disembowel it and test the jewels , we keep our sacrilegious hands off it .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 37]: We submit , not reluctantly , but rather gladly , for we are privately afraid we should find , upon examination that the jewels are of the sort that are manufactured at North Adams , Mass. .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 20]: I have n't any idea that Shakespeare will have to vacate his pedestal this side of the year 2209 .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 31]: Disbelief in him can not come swiftly , disbelief in a healthy and deeply-loved tar baby has never been known to disintegrate swiftly ; it is a very slow process .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 126]: It took several thousand years to convince our fine race -- including every splendid intellect in it -- that there is no such thing as a witch ; it has taken several thousand years to convince the same fine race -- including every splendid intellect in it -- that there is no such person as Satan ; it has taken several centuries to remove perdition from the Protestant Church 's program of post-mortem entertainments ; it has taken a weary long time to persuade American Presbyterians to give up infant damnation and try to bear it the best they can ; and it looks as if their Scotch brethren will still be burning babies in the everlasting fires when Shakespeare comes down from his perch .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 6]: We are The Reasoning Race .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 59]: We ca n't prove it by the above examples , and we ca n't prove it by the miraculous `` histories '' built by those Stratfordolaters out of a hatful of rags and a barrel of sawdust , but there is a plenty of other things we can prove it by , if I could think of them .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 36]: We are The Reasoning Race , and when we find a vague file of chipmunk-tracks stringing through the dust of Stratford village , we know by our reasoning bowers that Hercules has been along there .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 12]: I feel that our fetish is safe for three centuries yet .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 11]: The bust , too -- there in the Stratford Church .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 82]: The precious bust , the priceless bust , the calm bust , the serene bust , the emotionless bust , with the dandy mustache , and the putty face , unseamed of care -- that face which has looked passionlessly down upon the awed pilgrim for a hundred and fifty years and will still look down upon the awed pilgrim three hundred more , with the deep , deep , deep , subtle , subtle , subtle expression of a bladder .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 22]: XII Irreverence One of the most trying defects which I find in these -- these -- what shall I call them ?
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 30]: for I will not apply injurious epithets to them , the way they do to us , such violations of courtesy being repugnant to my nature and my dignity .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 34]: The farthest I can go in that direction is to call them by names of limited reverence -- names merely descriptive , never unkind , never offensive , never tainted by harsh feeling .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 15]: If THEY would do like this , they would feel better in their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 8]: Very well , then -- to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 43]: One of the most trying defects which I find in these Stratfordolaters , these Shakesperiods , these thugs , these bangalores , these troglodytes , these herumfrodites , these blatherskites , these buccaneers , these bandoleers , is their spirit of irreverence .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 15]: It is detectable in every utterance of theirs when they are talking about us .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 13]: I am thankful that in me there is nothing of that spirit .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 18]: When a thing is sacred to me it is impossible for me to be irreverent toward it .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 27]: I can not call to mind a single instance where I have ever been irreverent , except towards the things which were sacred to other people .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 6]: Am I in the right ?
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 4]: I think so .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 23]: But I ask no one to take my unsupported word ; no , look at the dictionary ; let the dictionary decide .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 7]: Here is the definition : IRREVERENCE .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 12]: The quality or condition of irreverence toward God and sacred things .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 6]: What does the Hindu say ?
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 6]: He says it is correct .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 37]: He says irreverence is lack of respect for Vishnu , and Brahma , and Chrishna , and his other gods , and for his sacred cattle , and for his temples and the things within them .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 20]: He endorses the definition , you see ; and there are 300,000,000 Hindus or their equivalents back of him .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 82]: The dictionary had the acute idea that by using the capital G it could restrict irreverence to lack of reverence for OUR Deity and our sacred things , but that ingenious and rather sly idea miscarried : for by the simple process of spelling HIS deities with capitals the Hindu confiscates the definition and restricts it to his own sects , thus making it clearly compulsory upon us to revere HIS gods and HIS sacred things , and nobody 's else .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 23]: We ca n't say a word , for he had our own dictionary at his back , and its decision is final .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 14]: This law , reduced to its simplest terms , is this : 1 .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 17]: Whatever is sacred to the Christian must be held in reverence by everybody else ; 2 .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 17]: whatever is sacred to the Hindu must be held in reverence by everybody else ; 3 .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 24]: therefore , by consequence , logically , and indisputably , whatever is sacred to ME must be held in reverence by everybody else .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 42]: Now then , what aggravates me is that these troglodytes and muscovites and bandoleers and buccaneers are ALSO trying to crowd in and share the benefit of the law , and compel everybody to revere their Shakespeare and hold him sacred .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 13]: We ca n't have that : there 's enough of us already .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 50]: If you go on widening and spreading and inflating the privilege , it will presently come to be conceded that each man 's sacred things are the ONLY ones , and the rest of the human race will have to be humbly reverent toward them or suffer for it .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 40]: That can surely happen , and when it happens , the word Irreverence will be regarded as the most meaningless , and foolish , and self-conceited , and insolent , and impudent , and dictatorial word in the language .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 20]: And people will say , `` Whose business is it what gods I worship and what things hold sacred ?
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 19]: Who has the right to dictate to my conscience , and where did he get that right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 12]: We can not afford to let that calamity come upon us .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 9]: We must save the word from this destruction .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 46]: There is but one way to do it , and that is to stop the spread of the privilege and strictly confine it to its present limits -- that is , to all the Christian sects , to all the Hindu sects , and me .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 18]: We do not need any more , the stock is watered enough , just as it is .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 13]: It would be better if the privilege were limited to me alone .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 23]: I think so because I am the only sect that knows how to employ it gently , kindly , charitably , dispassionately .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 9]: The other sects lack the quality of self-restraint .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 50]: The Catholic Church says the most irreverent things about matters which are sacred to the Protestants , and the Protestant Church retorts in kind about the confessional and other matters which Catholics hold sacred ; then both of these irreverencers turn upon Thomas Paine and charge HIM with irreverence .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 28]: This is all unfortunate , because it makes it difficult for students equipped with only a low grade of mentality to find out what Irreverence really IS .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 31]: It will surely be much better all around if the privilege of regulating the irreverent and keeping them in order shall eventually be withdrawn from all the sects but me .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 19]: Then there will be no more quarreling , no more bandying of disrespectful epithets , no more heartburnings .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 18]: There will then be nothing sacred involved in this Bacon-Shakespeare controversy except what is sacred to me .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 12]: That will simplify the whole matter , and trouble will cease .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 14]: There will be irreverence no longer , because I will not allow it .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 23]: The first time those criminals charge me with irreverence for calling their Stratford myth an Arthur-Orton-Mary-Baker-Thompson-Eddy-Louis-the-Seventeenth-Veiled-Prophet - of-Khorassan will be the last .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 26]: Taught by the methods found effective in extinguishing earlier offenders by the Inquisition , of holy memory , I shall know how to quiet them .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 47]: XIII Is n't it odd , when you think of it , that you may list all the celebrated Englishmen , Irishmen , and Scotchmen of modern times , clear back to the first Tudors -- a list containing five hundred names , shall we say ?
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 26]: -- and you can go to the histories , biographies , and cyclopedias and learn the particulars of the lives of every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 26]: Every one of them except one -- the most famous , the most renowned -- by far the most illustrious of them all -- Shakespeare !
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 155]: You can get the details of the lives of all the celebrated ecclesiastics in the list ; all the celebrated tragedians , comedians , singers , dancers , orators , judges , lawyers , poets , dramatists , historians , biographers , editors , inventors , reformers , statesmen , generals , admirals , discoverers , prize-fighters , murderers , pirates , conspirators , horse-jockeys , bunco-steerers , misers , swindlers , explorers , adventurers by land and sea , bankers , financiers , astronomers , naturalists , claimants , impostors , chemists , biologists , geologists , philologists , college presidents and professors , architects , engineers , painters , sculptors , politicians , agitators , rebels , revolutionists , patriots , demagogues , clowns , cooks , freaks , philosophers , burglars , highwaymen , journalists , physicians , surgeons -- you can get the life-histories of all of them but ONE .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 16]: Just ONE -- the most extraordinary and the most celebrated of them all -- Shakespeare !
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 36]: You may add to the list the thousand celebrated persons furnished by the rest of Christendom in the past four centuries , and you can find out the life-histories of all those people , too .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 22]: You will then have listed fifteen hundred celebrities , and you can trace the authentic life-histories of the whole of them .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 17]: Save one -- far and away the most colossal prodigy of the entire accumulation -- Shakespeare !
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 8]: About him you can find out NOTHING .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 7]: Nothing of even the slightest importance .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 11]: Nothing worth the trouble of stowing away in your memory .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 60]: Nothing that even remotely indicates that he was ever anything more than a distinctly commonplace person -- a manager , an actor of inferior grade , a small trader in a small village that did not regard him as a person of any consequence , and had forgotten all about him before he was fairly cold in his grave .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 24]: We can go to the records and find out the life-history of every renowned RACE-HORSE of modern times -- but not Shakespeare 's !
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 55]: There are many reasons why , and they have been furnished in cart-loads -LRB- of guess and conjecture -RRB- by those troglodytes ; but there is one that is worth all the rest of the reasons put together , and is abundantly sufficient all by itself -- HE HAD N'T ANY HISTORY TO RECORD .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 11]: There is no way of getting around that deadly fact .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 15]: And no sane way has yet been discovered of getting around its formidable significance .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 42]: Its quite plain significance -- to any but those thugs -LRB- I do not use the term unkindly -RRB- is , that Shakespeare had no prominence while he lived , and none until he had been dead two or three generations .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 26]: The Plays enjoyed high fame from the beginning ; and if he wrote them it seems a pity the world did not find it out .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 25]: He ought to have explained that he was the author , and not merely a NOM DE PLUME for another man to hide behind .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 34]: If he had been less intemperately solicitous about his bones , and more solicitous about his Works , it would have been better for his good name , and a kindness to us .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 6]: The bones were not important .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 23]: They will moulder away , they will turn to dust , but the Works will endure until the last sun goes down .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 3]: Mark Twain .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 4]: P.S. MARCH 25 .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 52]: About two months ago I was illuminating this Autobiography with some notions of mine concerning the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy , and I then took occasion to air the opinion that the Stratford Shakespeare was a person of no public consequence or celebrity during his lifetime , but was utterly obscure and unimportant .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 35]: And not only in great London , but also in the little village where he was born , where he lived a quarter of a century , and where he died and was buried .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 48]: I argued that if he had been a person of any note at all , aged villagers would have had much to tell about him many and many a year after his death , instead of being unable to furnish inquirers a single fact connected with him .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 34]: I believed , and I still believe , that if he had been famous , his notoriety would have lasted as long as mine has lasted in my native village out in Missouri .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 32]: It is a good argument , a prodigiously strong one , and most formidable one for even the most gifted and ingenious and plausible Stratfordolator to get around or explain away .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 40]: Today a Hannibal COURIER-POST of recent date has reached me , with an article in it which reinforces my contention that a really celebrated person can not be forgotten in his village in the short space of sixty years .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 89]: I will make an extract from it : Hannibal , as a city , may have many sins to answer for , but ingratitude is not one of them , or reverence for the great men she has produced , and as the years go by her greatest son , Mark Twain , or S. L. Clemens as a few of the unlettered call him , grows in the estimation and regard of the residents of the town he made famous and the town that made him famous .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 78]: His name is associated with every old building that is torn down to make way for the modern structures demanded by a rapidly growing city , and with every hill or cave over or through which he might by any possibility have roamed , while the many points of interest which he wove into his stories , such as Holiday Hill , Jackson 's Island , or Mark Twain Cave , are now monuments to his genius .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 16]: Hannibal is glad of any opportunity to do him honor as he had honored her .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 76]: So it has happened that the `` old timers '' who went to school with Mark or were with him on some of his usual escapades have been honored with large audiences whenever they were in a reminiscent mood and condescended to tell of their intimacy with the ordinary boy who came to be a very extraordinary humorist and whose every boyish act is now seen to have been indicative of what was to come .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 42]: Like Aunt Becky and Mrs. Clemens , they can now see that Mark was hardly appreciated when he lived here and that the things he did as a boy and was whipped for doing were not all bad , after all .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 79]: So they have been in no hesitancy about drawing out the bad things he did as well as the good in their efforts to get a `` Mark Twain '' story , all incidents being viewed in the light of his present fame , until the volume of `` Twainiana '' is already considerable and growing in proportion as the `` old timers '' drop away and the stories are retold second and third hand by their descendants .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 90]: With some seventy-three years and living in a villa instead of a house , he is a fair target , and let him incorporate , copyright , or patent himself as he will , there are some of his `` works '' that will go swooping up Hannibal chimneys as long as graybeards gather about the fires and begin with , `` I 've heard father tell , '' or possibly , `` Once when I. '' The Mrs. Clemens referred to is my mother -- WAS my mother .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 41]: And here is another extract from a Hannibal paper , of date twenty days ago : Miss Becca Blankenship died at the home of William Dickason , 408 Rock Street , at 2.30 o'clock yesterday afternoon , aged 72 years .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 23]: The deceased was a sister of `` Huckleberry Finn , '' one of the famous characters in Mark Twain 's TOM SAWYER .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 25]: She had been a member of the Dickason family -- the housekeeper -- for nearly forty-five years , and was a highly respected lady .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 32]: For the past eight years she had been an invalid , but was as well cared for by Mr. Dickason and his family as if she had been a near relative .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 14]: She was a member of the Park Methodist Church and a Christian woman .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 5]: I remember her well .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 24]: I have a picture of her in my mind which was graven there , clear and sharp and vivid , sixty-three years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 15]: She was at that time nine years old , and I was about eleven .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 34]: I remember where she stood , and how she looked ; and I can still see her bare feet , her bare head , her brown face , and her short tow-linen frock .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 4]: She was crying .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 10]: What it was about I have long ago forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 15]: But it was the tears that preserved the picture for me , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 13]: She was a good child , I can say that for her .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 8]: She knew me nearly seventy years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 11]: Did she forget me , in the course of time ?
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 4]: I think not .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 17]: If she had lived in Stratford in Shakespeare 's time , would she have forgotten him ?
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 34]: For he was never famous during his lifetime , he was utterly obscure in Stratford , and there would n't be any occasion to remember him after he had been dead a week .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 29]: `` Injun Joe , '' `` Jimmy Finn , '' and `` General Gaines '' were prominent and very intemperate ne'er - do-weels in Hannibal two generations ago .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 17]: Plenty of grayheads there remember them to this day , and can tell you about them .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 61]: Is n't it curious that two `` town drunkards '' and one half-breed loafer should leave behind them , in a remote Missourian village , a fame a hundred times greater and several hundred times more particularized in the matter of definite facts than Shakespeare left behind him in the village where he had lived the half of his lifetime ?
