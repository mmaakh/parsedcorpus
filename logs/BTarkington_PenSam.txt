Parsing [sent. 1 len. 25]: CHAPTER I. PENROD AND SAM During the daylight hours of several autumn Saturdays there had been severe outbreaks of cavalry in the Schofield neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 36]: The sabres were of wood ; the steeds were imaginary , and both were employed in a game called `` bonded pris ` ner '' by its inventors , Masters Penrod Schofield and Samuel Williams .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 6]: The pastime was not intricate .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 87]: When two enemies met , they fenced spectacularly until the person of one or the other was touched by the opposing weapon ; then , when the ensuing claims of foul play had been disallowed and the subsequent argument settled , the combatant touched was considered to be a prisoner until such time as he might be touched by the hilt of a sword belonging to one of his own party , which effected his release and restored to him the full enjoyment of hostile activity .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 29]: Pending such rescue , however , he was obliged to accompany the forces of his captor whithersoever their strategical necessities led them , which included many strange places .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 58]: For the game was exciting , and , at its highest pitch , would sweep out of an alley into a stable , out of that stable and into a yard , out of that yard and into a house , and through that house with the sound -LRB- and effect upon furniture -RRB- of trampling herds .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 48]: In fact , this very similarity must have been in the mind of the distressed coloured woman in Mrs. Williams 's kitchen , when she declared that she might `` jes ' as well try to cook right spang in the middle o ' the stock-yards . ''
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 26]: All up and down the neighbourhood the campaigns were waged , accompanied by the martial clashing of wood upon wood and by many clamorous arguments .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 12]: `` You 're a pris ` ner , Roddy Bitts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 6]: `` I am not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 6]: `` You are , too !
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 5]: I touched you . ''
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 10]: `` Where , I 'd like to know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 6]: `` On the sleeve . ''
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 5]: `` You did not !
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 5]: I never felt it .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 15]: I guess I 'd ` a ' felt it , would n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 7]: `` What if you did n't ?
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 9]: I touched you , and you 're bonded .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 8]: I leave it to Sam Williams . ''
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 3]: `` Yah !
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 4]: Course you would !
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 6]: He 's on your side !
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 9]: _ I _ leave it to Herman . ''
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 7]: `` No , you wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 29]: If you ca n't show any SENSE about it , we 'll do it over , and I guess you 'll see whether you feel it or not !
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 13]: NOW , I guess you -- '' `` Aw , squash ! ''
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 40]: Strangely enough , the undoubted champion proved to be the youngest and darkest of all the combatants , one Verman , coloured , brother to Herman , and substantially under the size to which his nine years entitled him .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 39]: Verman was unfortunately tongue-tied , but he was valiant beyond all others , and , in spite of every handicap , he became at once the chief support of his own party and the despair of the opposition .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 30]: On the third Saturday this opposition had been worn down by the successive captures of Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett until it consisted of only Sam Williams and Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 61]: Hence , it behooved these two to be wary , lest they be wiped out altogether ; and Sam was dismayed indeed , upon cautiously scouting round a corner of his own stable , to find himself face to face with the valorous and skilful Verman , who was acting as an outpost , or picket , of the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 29]: Verman immediately fell upon Sam , horse and foot , and Sam would have fled but dared not , for fear he might be touched from the rear .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 44]: Therefore , he defended himself as best he could , and there followed a lusty whacking , in the course of which Verman 's hat , a relic and too large , fell from his head , touching Sam 's weapon in falling .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 6]: panted Sam , desisting immediately .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 4]: `` That counts !
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 7]: You 're bonded , Verman . ''
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 5]: `` Aim meewer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 3]: Verman protested .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 18]: Interpreting this as `` Ai n't neither '' , Sam invented a law to suit the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 13]: `` Yes , you are ; that 's the rule , Verman .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 19]: I touched your hat with my sword , and your hat 's just the same as you . ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 5]: `` Imm mop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 3]: Verman insisted .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 26]: `` Yes , it is , '' said Sam , already warmly convinced -LRB- by his own statement -RRB- that he was in the right .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 4]: `` Listen here !
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 21]: If I hit you on the shoe , it would be the same as hitting YOU , would n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 17]: I guess it 'd count if I hit you on the shoe , would n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 11]: Well , a hat 's just the same as shoes .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 18]: Honest , that 's the rule , Verman , and you 're a pris ` ner . ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 30]: Now , in the arguing part of the game , Verman 's impediment cooperated with a native amiability to render him far less effective than in the actual combat .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 8]: He chuckled , and ceded the point .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 29]: `` Aw wi , '' he said , and cheerfully followed his captor to a hidden place among some bushes in the front yard , where Penrod lurked .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 9]: `` Looky what _ I _ got ! ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 11]: Sam said importantly , pushing his captive into this retreat .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 18]: `` NOW , I guess you wo n't say I 'm not so much use any more !
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 20]: Squat down , Verman , so 's they ca n't see you if they 're huntin ' for us .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 10]: That 's one o ' the rules -- honest .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 11]: You got to squat when we tell you to . ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 4]: Verman was agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 10]: He squatted , and then began to laugh uproariously .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 6]: `` Stop that noise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 3]: Penrod commanded .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 7]: `` You want to betray us ?
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 7]: What you laughin ' at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 10]: `` Ep mack im mimmup , '' Verman giggled .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 7]: `` What 's he mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 3]: Sam asked .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 13]: Penrod was more familiar with Verman 's utterance , and he interpreted .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 13]: `` He says they 'll get him back in a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 7]: `` No , they wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 20]: I 'd just like to see -- '' `` Yes , they will , too , '' Penrod said .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 23]: `` They 'll get him back for the main and simple reason we ca n't stay here all day , can we ?
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 12]: And they 'd find us anyhow , if we tried to .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 42]: There 's so many of 'em against just us two , they can run in and touch him soon as they get up to us -- and then HE 'LL be after us again and -- '' `` Listen here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 3]: Sam interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 12]: `` Why ca n't we put some REAL bonds on him ?
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 25]: We could put bonds on his wrists and around his legs -- we could put 'em all over him , easy as nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 18]: Then we could gag him -- '' `` No , we ca n't , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 28]: `` We ca n't , for the main and simple reason we have n't got any rope or anything to make the bonds with , have we ?
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 14]: I wish we had some o ' that stuff they give sick people .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 14]: THEN , I bet they would n't get him back so soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 5]: `` Sick people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 6]: Sam repeated , not comprehending .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 20]: `` It makes 'em go to sleep , no matter what you do to 'em , '' Penrod explained .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 34]: `` That 's the main and simple reason they ca n't wake up , and you can cut off their ole legs -- or their arms , or anything you want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 4]: `` Hoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 8]: exclaimed Verman , in a serious tone .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 15]: His laughter ceased instantly , and he began to utter a protest sufficiently intelligible .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 11]: `` You need n't worry , '' Penrod said gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 19]: `` We have n't got any o ' that stuff ; so we ca n't do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 13]: `` Well , we got to do sumpthing , '' Sam said .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 18]: His comrade agreed , and there was a thoughtful silence ; but presently Penrod 's countenance brightened .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 5]: `` I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 4]: he exclaimed . ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 11]: _ I _ know what we 'll do with him .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 10]: Why , I thought of it just as EASY !
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 36]: I can most always think of things like that , for the main and simple reason -- well , I thought of it just as soon -- '' `` Well , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 4]: Sam demanded crossly .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 46]: Penrod 's reiteration of his new-found phrase , `` for the main and simple reason '' , had been growing more and more irksome to his friend all day , though Sam was not definitely aware that the phrase was the cause of his annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 17]: `` WHAT are we goin ' to do with him , you know so much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 29]: Penrod rose and peered over the tops of the bushes , shading his eyes with his hand , a gesture that was unnecessary but had a good appearance .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 19]: He looked all round about him in this manner , finally vouchsafing a report to the impatient Sam .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 29]: `` No enemies in sight -- just for the main and simple reason I expect they 're all in the alley and in Georgie Bassett 's backyard . ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 8]: `` I bet they 're not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 9]: Sam said scornfully , his irritation much increased .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 11]: `` How do YOU know so much about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 17]: `` Just for the main and simple reason , '' Penrod replied , with dignified finality .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 19]: And at that , Sam felt a powerful impulse to do violence upon the person of his comrade-in-arms .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 35]: The emotion that prompted this impulse was so primitive and straightforward that it almost resulted in action ; but Sam had a vague sense that he must control it as long as he could .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 4]: `` Bugs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 11]: Penrod was sensitive , and this cold word hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 22]: However , he was under the domination of his strategic idea , and he subordinated private grievance to the common weal .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 5]: `` Get up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 3]: he commanded .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 9]: `` You get up , too , Verman .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 9]: You got to -- it 's the rule .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 14]: Now here I 'll SHOW you what we 're goin ' to do .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 17]: Stoop over , and both o ' you do just exackly like _ I _ do .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 17]: You watch ME , because this biz ` nuss has got to be done RIGHT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 16]: Sam muttered something ; he was becoming more insurgent every moment , but he obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 39]: Likewise , Verman rose to his feet , ducked his head between his shoulders , and trotted out to the sidewalk at Sam 's heels , both following Penrod and assuming a stooping position in imitation of him .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 23]: Verman was delighted with this phase of the game , and , also , he was profoundly amused by Penrod 's pomposity .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 35]: Something dim and deep within him perceived it to be cause for such merriment that he had ado to master himself , and was forced to bottle and cork his laughter with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 11]: They proved insufficient ; sputterings burst forth between his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 6]: `` You stop that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 10]: Penrod said , looking back darkly upon the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 40]: Verman endeavoured to oblige , though giggles continued to leak from him at intervals , and the three boys stole along the fence in single file , proceeding in this fashion until they reached Penrod 's own front gate .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 27]: Here the leader ascertained , by a reconnaissance as far as the corner , that the hostile forces were still looking for them in another direction .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 17]: He returned in a stealthy but important manner to his disgruntled follower and the hilarious captive .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 26]: `` Well , '' said Sam impatiently , `` I guess I 'm not goin ' to stand around here all day , I guess !
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 19]: You got anything you want to do , why 'n' t you go on and DO it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 28]: Penrod 's brow was already contorted to present the appearance of detached and lofty concentration -- a histrionic failure , since it did not deceive the audience .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 6]: He raised a hushing hand .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 4]: `` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 7]: `` I got to think . ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 4]: `` Bugs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 7]: the impolite Mr. Williams said again .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 32]: Verman bent double , squealing and sputtering ; indeed , he was ultimately forced to sit upon the ground , so exhausting was the mirth to which he now gave way .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 11]: Penrod 's composure was somewhat affected and he showed annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 22]: `` Oh , I guess you wo n't laugh quite so much about minute from now , ole Mister Verman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 4]: he said severely .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 14]: `` You get up from there and do like I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 20]: `` Well , why 'n' t you TELL him why he wo n't laugh so much , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 7]: Sam demanded , as Verman rose .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 17]: `` Why 'n' t you do sumpthing and quit talkin ' so much about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 9]: Penrod haughtily led the way into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 21]: `` You follow me , '' he said , `` and I guess you 'll learn a little sense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 52]: Then , abandoning his hauteur for an air of mystery equally irritating to Sam , he stole up the steps of the porch , and , after a moment 's manipulation of the knob of the big front door , contrived to operate the fastenings , and pushed the door open .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 10]: `` Come on , '' he whispered , beckoning .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 35]: And the three boys mounted the stairs to the floor above in silence -- save for a belated giggle on the part of Verman , which was restrained upon a terrible gesture from Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 26]: Verman buried his mouth as deeply as possible in a ragged sleeve , and confined his demonstrations to a heaving of the stomach and diaphragm .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 20]: Penrod led the way into the dainty room of his nineteen-year-old sister , Margaret , and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 30]: `` There , '' he said , in a low and husky voice , `` I expect you 'll see what I 'm goin ' to do now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 6]: `` Well , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 5]: the skeptical Sam asked .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 16]: `` If we stay here very long your mother 'll come and send us downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 15]: What 's the good of -- '' `` WAIT , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 7]: Penrod wailed , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 5]: `` My goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 40]: And going to an inner door , he threw it open , disclosing a clothes-closet hung with pretty garments of many kinds , while upon its floor were two rows of shoes and slippers of great variety and charm .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 45]: A significant thing is to be remarked concerning the door of this somewhat intimate treasury : there was no knob or latch upon the inner side , so that , when the door was closed , it could be opened only from the outside .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 3]: said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 34]: `` You get in there , Verman , and I 'll bet they wo n't get to touch you back out o ' bein ' our pris ` ner very soon , NOW !
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 7]: Oh , I guess not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 4]: `` Pshaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 3]: said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 11]: `` Is that all you were goin ' to do ?
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 22]: Why , your mother 'll come and make him get out the first -- '' `` No , she wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 24]: She and Margaret have gone to my aunt 's in the country , and are n't goin ' to be back till dark .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 31]: And even if he made a lot o ' noise , it 's kind of hard to hear anything from in there , anyway , when the door 's shut .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 16]: Besides , he 's got to keep quiet -- that 's the rule , Verman .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 20]: You 're a pris ` ner , and it 's the rule you ca n't holler or nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 7]: You unnerstand that , Verman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 8]: `` Aw wi , '' said Verman .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 7]: `` Then go on in there .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 3]: Hurry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 25]: The obedient Verman marched into the closet and sat down among the shoes and slippers , where he presented an interesting effect of contrast .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 25]: He was still subject to hilarity -- though endeavouring to suppress it by means of a patent-leather slipper -- when Penrod closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 10]: said Penrod , leading the way from the room .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 8]: `` I guess NOW you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 35]: Sam said nothing , and they came out to the open air and reached their retreat in the Williams ' yard again , without his having acknowledged Penrod 's service to their mutual cause .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 10]: `` I thought of that just as easy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 24]: Penrod remarked , probably prompted to this odious bit of complacency by Sam 's withholding the praise that might naturally have been expected .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 38]: And he was moved to add , `` I guess it 'd of been a pretty long while if we 'd had to wait for you to think of something as good as that , Sam . ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 6]: `` Why would it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 3]: Sam asked .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 12]: `` Why would it of been such a long while ? ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 18]: `` Oh , '' Penrod responded airily , `` just for the main and simple reason ! ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 7]: Sam could bear it no longer .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 7]: `` Oh , hush up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 4]: Penrod was stung .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 7]: `` Do you mean ME ? ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 5]: the goaded Sam replied .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 10]: `` Did you tell ME to hush up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 7]: `` Yes , I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 19]: `` I guess you do n't know who you 're talkin ' to , '' Penrod said ominously .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 17]: `` I guess I just better show you who you 're talkin ' to like that .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 31]: I guess you need a little sumpthing , for the main and simple -- '' Sam uttered an uncontrollable howl and sprang upon Penrod , catching him round the waist .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 26]: Simultaneously with this impact , the wooden swords spun through the air and were presently trodden underfoot as the two boys wrestled to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 12]: Penrod was not altogether surprised by the onset of his friend .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 35]: He had been aware of Sam 's increasing irritation -LRB- though neither boy could have clearly stated its cause -RRB- and that very irritation produced a corresponding emotion in the bosom of the irritator .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 30]: Mentally , Penrod was quite ready for the conflict -- nay , he welcomed it -- though , for the first few moments , Sam had the physical advantage .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 13]: However , it is proper that a neat distinction be drawn here .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 20]: This was a conflict ; but neither technically nor in the intention of the contestants was it a fight .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 26]: Penrod and Sam were both in a state of high exasperation , and there was great bitterness ; but no blows fell and no tears .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 25]: They strained , they wrenched , they twisted , and they panted and muttered : `` Oh , no , you do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 9]: `` Oh , I guess I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 10]: `` Oh , you will , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 13]: `` You 'll see what you get in about a minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 12]: `` I guess you 'll learn some sense this time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 38]: Streaks and blotches began to appear upon the two faces , where colour had been heightened by the ardent application of a cloth sleeve or shoulder , while ankles and insteps were scraped and toes were trampled .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 38]: Turf and shrubberies suffered , also , as the struggle went on , until finally the wrestlers pitched headlong into a young lilac bush , and came to earth together , among its crushed and sprawling branches .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 4]: `` OOCH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 5]: and `` WUF ! ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 27]: were the two exclamations which marked this episode , and then , with no further comment , the struggle was energetically continued upon a horizontal plane .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 18]: Now Penrod was on top , now Sam ; they rolled , they squirmed , they suffered .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 5]: And this contest endured .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 19]: It went on and on , and it was impossible to imagine its coming to a definite termination .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 31]: It went on so long that to both the participants it seemed to be a permanent thing , a condition that had always existed and that must always exist perpetually .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 38]: And thus they were discovered by a foray of the hostile party , headed by Roddy Bitts and Herman -LRB- older brother to Verman -RRB- and followed by the bonded prisoners , Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 21]: These and others caught sight of the writhing figures , and charged down upon them with loud cries of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 5]: `` Pris ` ner !
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 4]: Pris ` ner !
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 6]: Bonded pris ` ner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 18]: shrieked Roddy Bitts , and touched Penrod and Sam , each in turn , with his sabre .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 48]: Then , seeing that they paid no attention and that they were at his mercy , he recalled the fact that several times , during earlier stages of the game , both of them had been unnecessarily vigorous in `` touching '' his own rather plump person .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 43]: Therefore , the opportunity being excellent , he raised his weapon again , and , repeating the words `` bonded pris ` ner '' as ample explanation of his deed , brought into play the full strength of his good right arm .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 8]: He used the flat of the sabre .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 2]: WHACK !
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 2]: WHACK !
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 5]: Roddy was perfectly impartial .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 13]: It was a cold-blooded performance and even more effective than he anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 11]: For one thing , it ended the civil war instantly .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 45]: Sam and Penrod leaped to their feet , shrieking and bloodthirsty , while Maurice Levy capered with joy , Herman was so overcome that he rolled upon the ground , and Georgie Bassett remarked virtuously : `` It serves them right for fighting . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 18]: But Roddy Bitts foresaw that something not within the rules of the game was about to happen .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 3]: `` Here !
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 7]: You keep away from me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 5]: he quavered , retreating .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 11]: `` I was just takin ' you pris ` ners .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 15]: I guess I had a right to TOUCH you , did n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 14]: Neither Sam nor Penrod was able to see the matter in that light .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 21]: They had retrieved their own weapons , and they advanced upon Roddy with a purposefulness that seemed horrible to him .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 3]: `` Here !
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 7]: You keep away from me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 7]: he said , in great alarm .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 8]: `` I 'm goin ' home . ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 9]: He did go home -- but only subsequently .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 75]: What took place before his departure had the singular solidity and completeness of systematic violence ; also , it bore the moral beauty of all actions that lead to peace and friendship , for , when it was over , and the final vocalizations of Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , were growing faint with increasing distance , Sam and Penrod had forgotten their differences and felt well disposed toward each other once more .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 41]: All their animosity was exhausted , and they were in a glow of good feeling , though probably they were not conscious of any direct gratitude to Roddy , whose thoughtful opportunism was really the cause of this happy result .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 33]: THE BONDED PRISONER After such rigorous events , every one comprehended that the game of bonded prisoner was over , and there was no suggestion that it should or might be resumed .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 46]: The fashion of its conclusion had been so consummately enjoyed by all parties -LRB- with the natural exception of Roddy Bitts -RRB- that a renewal would have been tame ; hence , the various minds of the company turned to other matters and became restless .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 46]: Georgie Bassett withdrew first , remembering that if he expected to be as wonderful as usual , to-morrow , in Sunday-school , it was time to prepare himself , though this was not included in the statement he made alleging the cause of his departure .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 40]: Being detained bodily and pressed for explanation , he desperately said that he had to go home to tease the cook -- which had the rakehelly air he thought would insure his release , but was not considered plausible .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 47]: However , he was finally allowed to go , and , as first hints of evening were already cooling and darkening the air , the party broke up , its members setting forth , whistling , toward their several homes , though Penrod lingered with Sam .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 9]: Herman was the last to go from them .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 22]: `` Well , I got git ` at stove-wood f ' suppuh , '' he said , rising and stretching himself .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 43]: `` I got git ` at lil ' soap-box wagon , an ' go on ovuh wheres ` at new house buil ` in ' on Secon ' Street ; pick up few shingles an ' blocks layin ' roun ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 26]: He went through the yard toward the alley , and , at the alley gate , remembering something , he paused and called to them .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 18]: The lot was a deep one , and they were too far away to catch his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 10]: Sam shouted , `` Ca n't HEAR you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 22]: and Herman replied , but still unintelligibly ; then , upon Sam 's repetition of `` Ca n't HEAR you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 19]: Herman waved his arm in farewell , implying that the matter was of little significance , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 39]: But if they had understood him , Penrod and Sam might have considered his inquiry of instant importance , for Herman 's last shout was to ask if either of them had noticed `` where Verman went . ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 28]: Verman and Verman 's whereabouts were , at this hour , of no more concern to Sam and Penrod than was the other side of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 39]: That unfortunate bonded prisoner had been long since utterly effaced from their fields of consciousness , and the dark secret of their Bastille troubled them not -- for the main and simple reason that they had forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 46]: They drifted indoors , and found Sam 's mother 's white cat drowsing on a desk in the library , the which coincidence obviously inspired the experiment of ascertaining how successfully ink could be used in making a clean white cat look like a coach-dog .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 28]: There was neither malice nor mischief in their idea ; simply , a problem presented itself to the biological and artistic questionings beginning to stir within them .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 18]: They did not mean to do the cat the slightest injury or to cause her any pain .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 33]: They were above teasing cats , and they merely detained this one and made her feel a little wet -- at considerable cost to themselves from both the ink and the cat .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 60]: However , at the conclusion of their efforts , it was thought safer to drop the cat out of the window before anybody came , and , after some hasty work with blotters , the desk was moved to cover certain sections of the rug , and the two boys repaired to the bathroom for hot water and soap .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 28]: They knew they had done nothing wrong ; but they felt easier when the only traces remaining upon them were the less prominent ones upon their garments .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 46]: These precautions taken , it was time for them to make their appearance at Penrod 's house for dinner , for it had been arranged , upon petition earlier in the day , that Sam should be his friend 's guest for the evening meal .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 13]: Clean to the elbows and with light hearts , they set forth .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 37]: They marched , whistling -- though not producing a distinctly musical effect , since neither had any particular air in mind -- and they found nothing wrong with the world ; they had not a care .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 17]: Arrived at their adjacent destination , they found Miss Margaret Schofield just entering the front door .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 6]: `` Hurry , boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 17]: `` Mamma came home long before I did , and I 'm sure dinner is waiting .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 16]: Run on out to the dining-room and tell them I 'll be right down . ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 29]: And , as they obeyed , she mounted the stairs , humming a little tune and unfastening the clasp of the long , light-blue military cape she wore .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 57]: She went to her own quiet room , lit the gas , removed her hat and placed it and the cape upon the bed ; after which she gave her hair a push , subsequent to her scrutiny of a mirror ; then , turning out the light , she went as far as the door .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 21]: Being an orderly girl , she returned to the bed and took the cape and the hat to her clothes-closet .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 28]: She opened the door of this sanctuary , and , in the dark , hung her cape upon a hook and placed her hat upon the shelf .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 23]: Then she closed the door again , having noted nothing unusual , though she had an impression that the place needed airing .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 7]: She descended to the dinner table .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 34]: The other members of the family were already occupied with the meal , and the visitor was replying politely , in his non-masticatory intervals , to inquiries concerning the health of his relatives .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 23]: So sweet and assured was the condition of Sam and Penrod that Margaret 's arrival from her room meant nothing to them .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 16]: Their memories were not stirred , and they continued eating , their expressions brightly placid .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 29]: But from out of doors there came the sound of a calling and questing voice , at first in the distance , then growing louder -- coming nearer .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 5]: `` Oh , Ver-er-man !
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 5]: O-o-o-oh , Ver-er-ma-a-an ! ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 7]: It was the voice of Herman .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 6]: `` OO-O-O-O-OH , VER-ER-ER-MA-A-A-AN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 15]: And then two boys sat stricken at that cheerful table and ceased to eat .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 6]: Recollection awoke with a bang !
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 6]: `` Oh , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 3]: Sam gasped .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 4]: Mr. Schofield said .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 10]: `` Swallow something the wrong way , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 6]: `` Ye-es , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 6]: `` OO-O-O-O-OH , VER-ER-ER-MA-A-A-AN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 12]: And now the voice was near the windows of the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 13]: Penrod , very pale , pushed back his chair and jumped up .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter with YOU ? ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 4]: his father demanded .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 5]: `` Sit down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 18]: `` It 's Herman -- that coloured boy lives in the alley , '' Penrod said hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 17]: `` I expect -- I think -- '' `` Well , what 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 36]: `` I think his little brother 's maybe got lost , and Sam and I better go help look -- '' `` You 'll do nothing of the kind , '' Mr. Schofield said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 9]: `` Sit down and eat your dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 11]: In a palsy , the miserable boy resumed his seat .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 19]: He and Sam exchanged a single dumb glance ; then the eyes of both swung fearfully to Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 24]: Her appearance was one of sprightly content , and , from a certain point of view , nothing could have been more alarming .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 28]: If she had opened her closet door without discovering Verman , that must have been because Verman was dead and Margaret had failed to notice the body .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 11]: -LRB- Such were the thoughts of Penrod and Sam . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 10]: But she might not have opened the closet door .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 54]: And whether she had or not , Verman must still be there , alive or dead , for if he had escaped he would have gone home , and their ears would not be ringing with the sinister and melancholy cry that now came from the distance , `` Oo-o-oh , Ver-er-ma-an ! ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 23]: Verman , in his seclusion , did not hear that appeal from his brother ; there were too many walls between them .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 26]: But he was becoming impatient for release , though , all in all , he had not found the confinement intolerable or even very irksome .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 16]: His character was philosophic , his imagination calm ; no bugaboos came to trouble him .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 34]: When the boys closed the door upon him , he made himself comfortable upon the floor and , for a time , thoughtfully chewed a patent-leather slipper that had come under his hand .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 29]: He found the patent leather not unpleasant to his palate , though he swallowed only a portion of what he detached , not being hungry at that time .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 18]: The soul-fabric of Verman was of a fortunate weave ; he was not a seeker and questioner .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 27]: When it happened to him that he was at rest in a shady corner , he did not even think about a place in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 7]: Verman took life as it came .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 6]: Naturally , he fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 37]: And toward the conclusion of his slumbers , he had this singular adventure : a lady set her foot down within less than half an inch of his nose -- and neither of them knew it .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 18]: Verman slept on , without being wakened by either the closing or the opening of the door .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 27]: What did rouse him was something ample and soft falling upon him -- Margaret 's cape , which slid from the hook after she had gone .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 19]: Enveloped in its folds , Verman sat up , corkscrewing his knuckles into the corners of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 18]: Slowly he became aware of two important vacuums -- one in time and one in his stomach .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 42]: Hours had vanished strangely into nowhere ; the game of bonded prisoner was something cloudy and remote of the long , long ago , and , although Verman knew where he was , he had partially forgotten how he came there .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 26]: He perceived , however , that something had gone wrong , for he was certain that he ought not to be where he found himself .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 4]: WHITE-FOLKS ' HOUSE !
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 39]: The fact that Verman could not have pronounced these words rendered them no less clear in his mind ; they began to stir his apprehension , and nothing becomes more rapidly tumultuous than apprehension once it is stirred .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 31]: That he might possibly obtain release by making a noise was too daring a thought and not even conceived , much less entertained , by the little and humble Verman .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 38]: For , with the bewildering gap of his slumber between him and previous events , he did not place the responsibility for his being in White-Folks ' House upon the white folks who had put him there .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 20]: His state of mind was that of the stable-puppy who knows he MUST not be found in the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 45]: Not thrice in his life had Verman been within the doors of White-Folks ' House , and , above all things , he felt that it was in some undefined way vital to him to get out of White-Folks ' House unobserved and unknown .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 12]: It was in his very blood to be sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 17]: Further than this point , the processes of Verman 's mind become mysterious to the observer .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 41]: It appears , however , that he had a definite -LRB- though somewhat primitive -RRB- conception of the usefulness of disguise ; and he must have begun his preparations before he heard footsteps in the room outside his closed door .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 6]: These footsteps were Margaret 's .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 35]: Just as Mr. Schofield 's coffee was brought , and just after Penrod had been baffled in another attempt to leave the table , Margaret rose and patted her father impertinently upon the head .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 10]: `` You ca n't bully ME that way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 17]: `` I got home too late to dress , and I 'm going to a dance .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 4]: ` Scuse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 26]: And she began her dancing on the spot , pirouetting herself swiftly out of the room , and was immediately heard running up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 4]: `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 4]: Mr. Schofield shouted .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 4]: `` Sit down !
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 10]: How many times am I going to tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 9]: What IS the matter with you to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 10]: `` I GOT to go , '' Penrod gasped .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 9]: `` I got to tell Margaret sumpthing . ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 12]: `` What have you ` got ' to tell her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 14]: `` It 's -- it 's sumpthing I forgot to tell her . ''
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 17]: `` Well , it will keep till she comes downstairs , '' Mr. Schofield said grimly .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 11]: `` You sit down till this meal is finished . ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 5]: Penrod was becoming frantic .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 23]: `` I got to tell her -- it 's sumpthing Sam 's mother told me to tell her , '' he babbled .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 7]: `` Did n't she , Sam ?
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 16]: You heard her tell me to tell her ; did n't you , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 5]: Sam offered prompt corroboration .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 8]: `` Yes , sir ; she did .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 9]: She said for us both to tell her .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 18]: I better go , too , I guess , because she said -- '' He was interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 9]: Startlingly upon their ears rang shriek on shriek .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 29]: Mrs. Schofield , recognizing Margaret 's voice , likewise shrieked , and Mr. Schofield uttered various sounds ; but Penrod and Sam were incapable of doing anything vocally .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 6]: All rushed from the table .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 21]: Margaret continued to shriek , and it is not to be denied that there was some cause for her agitation .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 51]: When she opened the closet door , her light-blue military cape , instead of hanging on the hook where she had left it , came out into the room in a manner that she afterward described as `` a kind of horrible creep , but faster than a creep . ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 30]: Nothing was to be seen except the creeping cape , she said , but , of course , she could tell there was some awful thing inside of it .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 42]: It was too large to be a cat , and too small to be a boy ; it was too large to be Duke , Penrod 's little old dog , and , besides , Duke would n't act like that .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 48]: It crept rapidly out into the upper hall , and then , as she recovered the use of her voice and began to scream , the animated cape abandoned its creeping for a quicker gait -- `` a weird , heaving flop , '' she defined it .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 42]: The Thing then decided upon a third style of locomotion , evidently , for when Sam and Penrod reached the front hall , a few steps in advance of Mr. and Mrs. Schofield , it was rolling grandly down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 21]: Mr. Schofield had only a hurried glimpse of it as it reached the bottom , close by the front door .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 6]: `` Grab that thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 6]: he shouted , dashing forward .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 4]: `` Stop it !
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 4]: Hit it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 20]: It was at this moment that Sam Williams displayed the presence of mind that was his most eminent characteristic .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 24]: Sam 's wonderful instinct for the right action almost never failed him in a crisis , and it did not fail him now .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 28]: Leaping to the door , at the very instant when the rolling cape touched it , Sam flung the door open -- and the cape rolled on .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 16]: With incredible rapidity and intelligence , it rolled , indeed , out into the night .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 17]: Penrod jumped after it , and the next second reappeared in the doorway holding the cape .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 12]: He shook out its folds , breathing hard but acquiring confidence .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 28]: In fact , he was able to look up in his father 's face and say , with bright ingenuousness : `` It was just laying there .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 7]: Do you know what I think ?
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 11]: Well , it could n't have acted that way itself .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 14]: I think there must have been sumpthing kind of inside of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 11]: Mr. Schofield shook his head slowly , in marvelling admiration .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 8]: `` Brilliant -- oh , brilliant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 21]: he murmured , while Mrs. Schofield ran to support the enfeebled form of Margaret at the top of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 36]: ... In the library , after Margaret 's departure to her dance , Mr. and Mrs. Schofield were still discussing the visitation , Penrod having accompanied his homeward-bound guest as far as the front gate .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 40]: `` No ; you 're wrong , '' Mrs. Schofield said , upholding a theory , earlier developed by Margaret , that the animated behaviour of the cape could be satisfactorily explained on no other ground than the supernatural .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 68]: `` You see , the boys saying they could n't remember what Mrs. Williams wanted them to tell Margaret , and that probably she had n't told them anything to tell her , because most likely they 'd misunderstood something she said -- well , of course , all that does sound mixed-up and peculiar ; but they sound that way about half the time , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 15]: No ; it could n't possibly have had a thing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 27]: They were right there at the table with us all the time , and they came straight to the table the minute they entered the house .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 13]: Before that , they 'd been over at Sam 's all afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 11]: So , it COULD N'T have been the boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 27]: Mrs. Schofield paused to ruminate with a little air of pride ; then added : `` Margaret has often thought -- oh , long before this !
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 7]: -- that she was a medium .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 10]: I mean -- if she would let her self .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 10]: So it was n't anything the boys did . ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 4]: Mr. Schofield grunted .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 11]: `` I 'll admit this much , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 17]: `` I 'll admit it was n't anything we 'll ever get out of 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 30]: And the remarks of Sam and Penrod , taking leave of each other , one on each side of the gate , appeared to corroborate Mr. Schofield 's opinion .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 14]: `` Well , g ' - night , Penrod , '' Sam said .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 13]: `` It was a pretty good Saturday , was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 4]: `` Fine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 4]: said Penrod casually .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 9]: `` G ' - night , Sam . ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 26]: THE MILITARIST PENROD SCHOFIELD , having been `` kept-in '' for the unjust period of twenty minutes after school , emerged to a deserted street .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 14]: That is , the street was deserted so far as Penrod was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 35]: Here and there people were to be seen upon the sidewalks , but they were adults , and they and the shade trees had about the same quality of significance in Penrod 's consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 50]: Usually he saw grown people in the mass , which is to say , they were virtually invisible to him , though exceptions must be taken in favour of policemen , firemen , street-car conductors , motormen , and all other men in any sort of uniform or regalia .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 26]: But this afternoon none of these met the roving eye , and Penrod set out upon his homeward way wholly dependent upon his own resources .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 38]: To one of Penrod 's inner texture , a mere unadorned walk from one point to another was intolerable , and he had not gone a block without achieving some slight remedy for the tameness of life .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 31]: An electric-light pole at the corner , invested with powers of observation , might have been surprised to find itself suddenly enacting a role of dubious honour in improvised melodrama .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 54]: Penrod , approaching , gave the pole a look of sharp suspicion , then one of conviction ; slapped it lightly and contemptuously with his open hand ; passed on a few paces , but turned abruptly , and , pointing his right forefinger , uttered the symbolic word , `` Bing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 62]: The plot was somewhat indefinite ; yet nothing is more certain than that the electric-light pole had first attempted something against him , then growing bitter when slapped , and stealing after him to take him treacherously in the back , had got itself shot through and through by one too old in such warfare to be caught off his guard .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 35]: Leaving the body to lie where it was , he placed the smoking pistol in a holster at his saddlebow -- he had decided that he was mounted -- and proceeded up the street .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 26]: At intervals he indulged himself in other encounters , reining in at first suspicion of ambush with a muttered , `` Whoa , Charlie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 7]: or `` Whoa , Mike ! ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 8]: or even `` Whoa , Washington ! ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 41]: for preoccupation with the enemy outweighed attention to the details of theatrical consistency , though the steed 's varying names were at least harmoniously masculine , since a boy , in these , creative moments , never rides a mare .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 26]: And having brought Charlie or Mike or Washington to a standstill , Penrod would draw the sure weapon from its holster and -- `` Bing !
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 2]: Bing !
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 3]: Bing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 6]: -- let them have it .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 19]: It is not to be understood that this was a noisy performance , or even an obvious one .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 29]: It attracted no attention from any pedestrian , and it was to be perceived only that a boy was proceeding up the street at a somewhat irregular gait .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 21]: Three or four years earlier , when Penrod was seven or eight , he would have shouted `` Bing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 25]: at the top of his voice ; he would have galloped openly ; all the world might have seen that he bestrode a charger .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 11]: But a change had come upon him with advancing years .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 24]: Although the grown people in sight were indeed to him as walking trees , his dramas were accomplished principally by suggestion and symbol .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 39]: His `` Whoas '' and `` Bings '' were delivered in a husky whisper , and his equestrianism was established by action mostly of the mind , the accompanying artistry of the feet being unintelligible to the passerby .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 25]: And yet , though he concealed from observation the stirring little scenes he thus enacted , a love of realism was increasing within him .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 44]: Early childhood is not fastidious about the accessories of its drama -- a cane is vividly a gun which may instantly , as vividly , become a horse ; but at Penrod 's time of life the lath sword is no longer satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 35]: Indeed , he now had a vague sense that weapons of wood were unworthy to the point of being contemptible and ridiculous , and he employed them only when he was alone and unseen .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 27]: For months a yearning had grown more and more poignant in his vitals , and this yearning was symbolized by one of his most profound secrets .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 32]: In the inner pocket of his jacket , he carried a bit of wood whittled into the distant likeness of a pistol , but not even Sam Williams had seen it .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 36]: The wooden pistol never knew the light of day , save when Penrod was in solitude ; and yet it never left his side except at night , when it was placed under his pillow .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 19]: Still , it did not satisfy ; it was but the token of his yearning and his dream .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 15]: With all his might and main Penrod longed for one thing beyond all others .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 6]: He wanted a Real Pistol !
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 4]: That was natural .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 41]: Pictures of real pistols being used to magnificently romantic effect were upon almost all the billboards in town , the year round , and as for the `` movie '' shows , they could not have lived an hour unpistoled .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 33]: In the drug store , where Penrod bought his candy and soda when he was in funds , he would linger to turn the pages of periodicals whose illustrations were fascinatingly pistolic .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 29]: Some of the magazines upon the very library table at home were sprinkled with pictures of people -LRB- usually in evening clothes -RRB- pointing pistols at other people .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 70]: Nay , the Library Board of the town had emitted a `` Selected List of Fifteen Books for Boys , '' and Penrod had read fourteen of them with pleasure , but as the fifteenth contained no weapons in the earlier chapters and held forth little prospect of any shooting at all , he abandoned it halfway , and read the most sanguinary of the other fourteen over again .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 20]: So , the daily food of his imagination being gun , what wonder that he thirsted for the Real !
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 17]: He passed from the sidewalk into his own yard , with a subdued `` Bing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 25]: inflicted upon the stolid person of a gatepost , and , entering the house through the kitchen , ceased to bing for a time .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 27]: However , driven back from the fore part of the house by a dismal sound of callers , he returned to the kitchen and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 32]: `` Della , '' he said to the cook , `` do you know what I 'd do if you was a crook and I had my ottomatic with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 6]: Della was industrious and preoccupied .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 8]: `` If I was a cook ! ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 9]: she repeated ignorantly , and with no cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 8]: `` Well , I AM a cook .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 7]: I 'm a-cookin ' right now .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 22]: Either g ` wan in the house where y' b ` long , or git out in th ' yard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 42]: Penrod chose the latter , and betook himself slowly to the back fence , where he was greeted in a boisterous manner by his wistful little old dog , Duke , returning from some affair of his own in the alley .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 5]: `` Get down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 12]: said Penrod coldly , and bestowed a spiritless `` Bing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 3]: upon him .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 17]: At this moment a shout was heard from the alley , `` Yay , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 13]: and the sandy head of comrade Sam Williams appeared above the fence .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 9]: `` Come on over , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 48]: As Sam obediently climbed the fence , the little old dog , Duke , moved slowly away , but presently , glancing back over his shoulder and seeing the two boys standing together , he broke into a trot and disappeared round a corner of the house .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 36]: He was a dog of long and enlightening experience ; and he made it clear that the conjunction of Penrod and Sam portended events which , from his point of view , might be unfortunate .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 14]: Duke had a forgiving disposition , but he also possessed a melancholy wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 44]: In the company of either Penrod or Sam , alone , affection often caused him to linger , albeit with a little pessimism , but when he saw them together , he invariably withdrew in as unobtrusive a manner as haste would allow .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 7]: `` What you doin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 3]: Sam asked .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 4]: `` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 4]: What you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 27]: `` I 'll show you if you 'll come over to our house , '' said Sam , who was wearing an important and secretive expression .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 5]: Penrod showed little interest .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 20]: `` Well , I said I 'd show you if you came on over , did n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 17]: `` But you have n't got anything I have n't got , '' said Penrod indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 41]: `` I know everything that 's in your yard and in your stable , and there is n't a thing -- '' `` I did n't say it was in the yard or in the stable , did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 32]: `` Well , there ai n't anything in your house , '' returned Penrod frankly , `` that I 'd walk two feet to look at -- not a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 4]: Sam assumed mockery .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 9]: `` Oh , no , you would n't !
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 10]: You know what it is , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 6]: Yes , you do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 6]: Penrod 's curiosity stirred somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 18]: `` Well , all right , '' he said , `` I got nothin ' to do .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 6]: I just as soon go .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 16]: `` You wait and see , '' said Sam , as they climbed the fence .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 18]: `` I bet YOUR ole eyes 'll open pretty far in about a minute or so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 7]: `` I bet they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 23]: It takes a good deal to get me excited , unless it 's sumpthing mighty -- '' `` You 'll see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 3]: Sam promised .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 37]: He opened an alley , gate and stepped into his own yard in a manner signalling caution -- though the exploit , thus far , certainly required none and Penrod began to be impressed and hopeful .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 26]: They entered the house , silently , encountering no one , and Sam led the way upstairs , tiptoeing , implying unusual and increasing peril .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 39]: Turning , in the upper hall , they went into Sam 's father 's bedroom , and Sam closed the door with a caution so genuine that already Penrod 's eyes began to fulfil his host 's prediction .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 32]: Adventures in another boy 's house are trying to the nerves ; and another boy 's father 's bedroom , when invaded , has a violated sanctity that is almost appalling .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 18]: Penrod felt that something was about to happen -- something much more important than he had anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 37]: Sam tiptoed across the room to a chest of drawers , and , kneeling , carefully pulled out the lowest drawer until the surface of its contents -- Mr. Williams ' winter underwear -- lay exposed .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 22]: Then he fumbled beneath the garments and drew forth a large object , displaying it triumphantly to the satisfactorily dumfounded Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 17]: It was a blue-steel Colt 's revolver , of the heaviest pattern made in the Seventies .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 45]: Mr. Williams had inherited it from Sam 's grandfather -LRB- a small man , a deacon , and dyspeptic -RRB- and it was larger and more horrible than any revolver either of the boys had ever seen in any picture , moving or stationary .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 25]: Moreover , greenish bullets of great size were to be seen in the chambers of the cylinder , suggesting massacre rather than mere murder .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 9]: This revolver was Real and it was Loaded !
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 10]: BINGISM Both boys lived breathlessly through a magnificent moment .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 7]: `` Leave me have it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 3]: gasped Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 9]: `` Leave me have hold of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 7]: `` You wait a minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 7]: Sam protested , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 11]: `` I want to show you how I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 15]: `` No ; you let me show you how _ I _ do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 9]: Penrod insisted ; and they scuffled for possession .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 5]: `` Look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 4]: Sam whispered warningly .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 7]: `` It might go off . ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 10]: `` Then you better leave me have it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 16]: And Penrod , victorious and flushed , stepped back , the weapon in his grasp .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 45]: `` Here , '' he said , `` this is the way I do : You be a crook ; and suppose you got a dagger , and I -- '' `` I do n't want any dagger , '' Sam protested , advancing .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 6]: `` I want that revolaver .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 12]: It 's my father 's revolaver , ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 11]: `` Well , WAIT a minute , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 19]: I got a right to show you the way I DO , first , have n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 8]: Penrod began an improvisation on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 16]: `` Say I 'm comin ' along after dark like this -- look , Sam !
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 18]: And say you try to make a jump at me -- '' `` I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 6]: Sam declined this role impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 15]: `` I guess it ai n't YOUR father 's revolaver , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 22]: `` Well , it may be your father 's but it ai n't yours , '' Penrod argued , becoming logical .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 25]: `` It ai n't either ' r of us revolaver , so I got as much right -- '' `` You have n't either .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 18]: It 's my fath -- '' `` WATCH , ca n't you -- just a minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 4]: Penrod urged vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 13]: `` I 'm not goin ' to keep it , am I ?
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 13]: You can have it when I get through , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 31]: Here 's how _ I _ do : I 'm comin ' along after dark , just walkin ' along this way -- like this -- look , Sam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 28]: Penrod , suiting the action to the word , walked to the other end of the room , swinging the revolver at his side with affected carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 23]: `` I 'm just walkin ' along like this , and first I do n't see you , '' continued the actor .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 21]: `` Then I kind of get a notion sumpthing wrong 's liable to happen , so I -- No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 5]: He interrupted himself abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 8]: `` No ; that is n't it .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 14]: You would n't notice that I had my good ole revolaver with me .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 26]: You would n't think I had one , because it 'd be under my coat like this , and you would n't see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 34]: Penrod stuck the muzzle of the pistol into the waistband of his knickerbockers at the left side and , buttoning his jacket , sustained the weapon in concealment by pressure of his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 29]: `` So you think I have n't got any ; you think I 'm just a man comin ' along , and so you -- '' Sam advanced .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 13]: `` Well , you 've had your turn , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 7]: `` Now , it 's mine .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 20]: I 'm goin ' to show you how I -- '' `` WATCH me , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 3]: Penrod wailed .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 15]: `` I have n't showed you how _ I _ do , have I ?
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 3]: My goodness !
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 9]: Ca n't you watch me a minute ? ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 5]: `` I HAVE been !
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 17]: You said yourself it 'd be my turn soon as you -- '' `` My goodness !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 11]: Let me have a CHANCE , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 22]: Penrod retreated to the wall , turning his right side toward Sam and keeping the revolver still protected under his coat .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 14]: `` I got to have my turn first , have n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 10]: `` Well , yours is over long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 6]: `` It is n't either !
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 38]: I -- '' `` Anyway , '' said Sam decidedly , clutching him by the right shoulder and endeavouring to reach his left side -- `` anyway , I 'm goin ' to have it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 11]: `` You said I could have my turn out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 11]: Penrod , carried away by indignation , raised his voice .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 6]: `` I did not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 12]: Sam , likewise lost to caution , asserted his denial loudly .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 7]: `` You did , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 12]: `` You said -- '' `` I never said anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 8]: `` You said -- Quit that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 4]: `` Boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 19]: Mrs. Williams , Sam 's mother , opened the door of the room and stood upon the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 22]: The scuffling of Sam and Penrod ceased instantly , and they stood hushed and stricken , while fear fell upon them .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 12]: `` Boys , you were n't quarrelling , were you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 3]: said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 8]: `` Were you quarrelling with Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 13]: `` No , ma'am , '' answered Sam in a small voice .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 6]: `` It sounded like it .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 6]: What was the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 9]: Both boys returned her curious glance with meekness .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 10]: They were summoning their faculties -- which were needed .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 19]: Indeed , these are the crises which prepare a boy for the business difficulties of his later life .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 55]: Penrod , with the huge weapon beneath his jacket , insecurely supported by an elbow and by a waistband which he instantly began to distrust , experienced distressful sensations similar to those of the owner of too heavily insured property carrying a gasoline can under his overcoat and detained for conversation by a policeman .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 48]: And if , in the coming years it was to be Penrod 's lot to find himself in that precise situation , no doubt he would be the better prepared for it on account of this present afternoon 's experience under the scalding eye of Mrs. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 16]: It should be added that Mrs. Williams 's eye was awful to the imagination only .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 41]: It was a gentle eye and but mildly curious , having no remote suspicion of the dreadful truth , for Sam had backed upon the chest of drawers and closed the damnatory open one with the calves of his legs .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 41]: Sam , not bearing the fatal evidence upon his person , was in a better state than Penrod , though when boys fall into the stillness now assumed by these two , it should be understood that they are suffering .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 22]: Penrod , in fact , was the prey to apprehension so keen that the actual pit of his stomach was cold .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 39]: Being the actual custodian of the crime , he understood that his case was several degrees more serious than that of Sam , who , in the event of detection , would be convicted as only an accessory .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 23]: It was a lesson , and Penrod already repented his selfishness in not allowing Sam to show how he did , first .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 12]: `` You 're sure you were n't quarrelling , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 4]: said Mrs. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 11]: `` No , ma'am ; we were just talking . ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 13]: Still she seemed dimly uneasy , and her eye swung to Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 12]: `` What were you and Sam talking about , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 8]: `` What were you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 4]: Penrod gulped invisibly .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 13]: `` Well , '' he murmured , `` it was n't much .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 4]: Different things . ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 5]: `` What things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 6]: `` Oh , just sumpthing .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 4]: Different things . ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 32]: `` I 'm glad you were n't quarrelling , '' said Mrs. Williams , reassured by this reply , which , though somewhat baffling , was thoroughly familiar to her ear .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 32]: `` Now , if you 'll come downstairs , I 'll give you each one cookie and no more , so your appetites wo n't be spoiled for your dinners . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 10]: She stood , evidently expecting them to precede her .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 31]: To linger might renew vague suspicion , causing it to become more definite ; and boys preserve themselves from moment to moment , not often attempting to secure the future .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 38]: Consequently , the apprehensive Sam and the unfortunate Penrod -LRB- with the monstrous implement bulking against his ribs -RRB- walked out of the room and down the stairs , their countenances indicating an interior condition of solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 13]: And a curious shade of behaviour might have here interested a criminologist .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 40]: Penrod endeavoured to keep as close to Sam as possible , like a lonely person seeking company , while , on the other hand , Sam kept moving away from Penrod , seeming to desire an appearance of aloofness .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 23]: `` Go into the library , boys , '' said Mrs. Williams , as the three reached the foot of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 8]: `` I 'll bring you your cookies .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 6]: Papa 's in there . ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 18]: Under her eye the two entered the library , to find Mr. Williams reading his evening paper .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 19]: He looked up pleasantly , but it seemed to Penrod that he had an ominous and penetrating expression .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 12]: `` What have you been up to , you boys ? ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 4]: inquired this enemy .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 7]: `` Nothing , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 5]: `` Different things . ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 5]: `` What like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 8]: `` Oh -- just different things . ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 12]: Mr. Williams nodded ; then his glance rested casually upon Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 12]: `` What 's the matter with your arm , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 12]: Penrod became paler , and Sam withdrew from him almost conspicuously .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 4]: `` Sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 13]: `` I said , What 's the matter with your arm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 5]: `` Which one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 3]: Penrod quavered .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 4]: `` Your left .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 11]: You seem to be holding it at an unnatural position .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 6]: Have you hurt it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 3]: Penrod swallowed .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 16]: A boy bit me -- I mean a dog -- a dog bit me . ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 11]: Mr. Williams murmured sympathetically : `` That 's too bad !
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 7]: Where did he bite you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 10]: `` On the -- right on the elbow . ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 4]: `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 9]: Perhaps you ought to have it cauterized . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 4]: `` Sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 11]: `` Did you have a doctor look at it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 13]: My mother put some stuff from the drug store on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 6]: `` Oh , I see .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 9]: Probably it 's all right , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 16]: Penrod drew breath more freely , and accepted the warm cookie Mrs. Williams brought him .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 6]: He ate it without relish .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 12]: `` You can have only one apiece , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 7]: `` It 's too near dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 16]: You need n't beg for any more , because you ca n't have 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 16]: They were good about that ; they were in no frame of digestion for cookies .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 11]: `` Was it your own dog that bit you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 4]: Mr. Williams inquired .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 3]: `` Sir ?
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 4]: No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 6]: It was n't Duke . ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 4]: `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 4]: Mrs. Williams exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 7]: `` When did it happen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 13]: `` I do n't remember just when , '' he answered feebly .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 10]: `` I guess it was day before yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 3]: `` Gracious !
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 17]: How did it -- '' `` He -- he just came up and bit me . ''
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 7]: `` Why , that 's terrible !
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 20]: It might be dangerous for other children , '' said Mrs. Williams , with a solicitous glance at Sam .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 11]: `` Do n't you know whom he belongs to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 4]: `` No 'm .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 7]: It was just a dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 5]: `` You poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 28]: Your mother must have been dreadfully frightened when you came home and she saw -- '' She was interrupted by the entrance of a middle-aged coloured woman .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 47]: `` Miz Williams , '' she began , and then , as she caught sight of Penrod , she addressed him directly , `` You ' ma telefoam if you here , send you home right away , 'cause they waitin ' dinner on you . ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 28]: `` Run along , then , '' said Mrs. Williams , patting the visitor lightly upon his shoulder ; and she accompanied him to the front door .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 25]: `` Tell your mother I 'm so sorry about your getting bitten , and you must take good care of it , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 23]: Penrod lingered helplessly outside the doorway , looking at Sam , who stood partially obscured in the hall , behind Mrs. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 27]: Penrod 's eyes , with veiled anguish , conveyed a pleading for help as well as a horror of the position in which he found himself .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 54]: Sam , however , pale and determined , seemed to have assumed a stony attitude of detachment , as if it were well understood between them that his own comparative innocence was established , and that whatever catastrophe ensued , Penrod had brought it on and must bear the brunt of it alone .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 27]: `` Well , you 'd better run along , since they 're waiting for you at home , '' said Mrs. Williams , closing the door .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 6]: `` Good-night , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 23]: ... Ten minutes later Penrod took his place at his own dinner-table , somewhat breathless but with an expression of perfect composure .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 13]: `` Ca n't you EVER come home without being telephoned for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 4]: demanded his father .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 34]: And Penrod added reproachfully , placing the blame upon members of Mr. Schofield 's own class , `` Sam 's mother and father kept me , or I 'd been home long ago .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 21]: They would keep on talkin ' , and I guess I had to be POLITE , did n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 48]: His left arm was as free as his right ; there was no dreadful bulk beneath his jacket , and at Penrod 's age the future is too far away to be worried about the difference between temporary security and permanent security is left for grown people .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 21]: To Penrod , security was security , and before his dinner was half eaten his spirit had become fairly serene .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 62]: Nevertheless , when he entered the empty carriage-house of the stable , on his return from school the next afternoon , his expression was not altogether without apprehension , and he stood in the doorway looking well about him before he lifted a loosened plank in the flooring and took from beneath it the grand old weapon of the Williams family .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 27]: Not did his eye lighten with any pleasurable excitement as he sat himself down in a shadowy corner and began some sketchy experiments with the mechanism .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 8]: The allure of first sight was gone .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 42]: In Mr. Williams ' bedchamber , with Sam clamouring for possession , it had seemed to Penrod that nothing in the world was so desirable as to have that revolver in his own hands -- it was his dream come true .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 46]: But , for reasons not definitely known to him , the charm had departed ; he turned the cylinder gingerly , almost with distaste ; and slowly there stole over him a feeling that there was something repellent and threatening in the heavy blue steel .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 12]: Thus does the long-dreamed Real misbehave -- not only for Penrod !
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 33]: More out of a sense of duty to bingism in general than for any other reason , he pointed the revolver at the lawn-mower , and gloomily murmured , `` Bing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 19]: Simultaneously , a low and cautious voice sounded from the yard outside , `` Yay , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 20]: and Sam Williams darkened the doorway , his eye falling instantly upon the weapon in his friend 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 7]: Sam seemed relieved to see it .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 13]: `` You did n't get caught with it , did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 4]: he said hastily .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 7]: Penrod shook his head , rising .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 5]: `` I guess not !
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 24]: I guess I got SOME brains around me , '' he added , inspired by Sam 's presence to assume a slight swagger .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 25]: `` They 'd have to get up pretty early to find any good ole revolaver , once I got MY hands on it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 16]: `` I guess we can keep it , all right , '' Sam said confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 92]: `` Because this morning papa was putting on his winter underclothes and he found it was n't there , and they looked all over and everywhere , and he was pretty mad , and said he knew it was those cheap plumbers stole it that mamma got instead of the regular plumbers he always used to have , and he said there was n't any chance ever gettin ' it back , because you could n't tell which one took it , and they 'd all swear it was n't them .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 18]: So it looks like we could keep it for our revolaver , Penrod , do n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 9]: I 'll give you half of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 5]: Penrod affected some enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 14]: `` Sam , we 'll keep it out here in the stable . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 12]: `` Yes , and we 'll go huntin ' with it .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 10]: We 'll do lots of things with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 26]: But Sam made no effort to take it , and neither boy seemed to feel yesterday 's necessity to show the other how he did .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 10]: `` Wait till next Fourth o ' July ! ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 3]: Sam continued .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 5]: `` Oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 4]: Look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 8]: This incited a genuine spark from Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 6]: `` Fourth o ' July !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 12]: I guess she 'll be a little better than any firecrackers !
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 7]: Just a little ` Bing ! '
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 2]: Bing !
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 3]: Bing ! '
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 6]: she 'll be goin ' .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 3]: ` Bing !
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 2]: Bing !
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 4]: Bing ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 8]: The suggestion of noise stirred his comrade .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 17]: `` I 'll bet she 'll go off louder 'n that time the gas-works blew up !
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 13]: I would n't be afraid to shoot her off ANY time . ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 10]: `` I bet you would , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 20]: `` You are n't used to revolavers the way I -- '' `` You are n't , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 21]: Sam exclaimed promptly , `` I would n't be any more afraid to shoot her off than you would . ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 7]: `` You would , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 6]: `` I would not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 15]: `` Well , let 's see you then ; you talk so much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 16]: And Penrod handed the weapon scornfully to Sam , who at once became less self-assertive .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 26]: `` I 'd shoot her off in a minute , '' Sam said , `` only it might break sumpthing if it hit it . ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 10]: `` Hold her up in the air , then .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 11]: It ca n't hurt the roof , can it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 15]: Sam , with a desperate expression , lifted the revolver at arm 's length .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 20]: Both boys turned away their heads , and Penrod put his fingers in his ears -- but nothing happened .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 15]: `` Why do n't you go on if you 're goin ' to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 5]: Sam lowered his arm .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 20]: `` I guess I did n't have her cocked , '' he said apologetically , whereupon Penrod loudly jeered .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 16]: `` Tryin ' to shoot a revolaver and did n't know enough to cock her !
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 20]: If I did n't know any more about revolavers than that , I 'd -- '' `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 27]: Sam exclaimed , managing to draw back the hammer until two chilling clicks warranted his opinion that the pistol was now ready to perform its office .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 15]: `` I guess she 'll do all right to suit you THIS time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 17]: `` Well , why n't you go ahead , then ; you know so much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 21]: And as Sam raised his arm , Penrod again turned away his head and placed his forefingers in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 4]: A pause followed .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 9]: `` Why 'n' t you go ahead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 35]: Penrod , after waiting in keen suspense , turned to behold his friend standing with his right arm above his head , his left hand over his left ear , and both eyes closed .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 31]: `` I ca n't pull the trigger , '' said Sam indistinctly , his face convulsed as in sympathy with the great muscular efforts of other parts of his body .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 7]: `` She wo n't pull ! ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 6]: `` She wo n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 5]: Penrod remarked with scorn .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 12]: `` I 'll bet _ I _ could pull her . ''
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 12]: Sam promptly opened his eyes and handed the weapon to Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 14]: `` All right , '' he said , with surprising and unusual mildness .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 8]: `` You try her , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 18]: Inwardly discomfited to a disagreeable extent , Penrod attempted to talk his own misgivings out of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 7]: `` Poor ` ittle baby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 17]: he said , swinging the pistol at his side with a fair pretense of careless ease .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 11]: `` Ai n't even strong enough to pull a trigger !
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 5]: Poor ` ittle baby !
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 42]: Well , if you ca n't even do that much , you better watch me while _ I _ -- '' `` Well , '' said Sam reasonably , `` why do n't you go on and do it then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 14]: `` Well , I AM goin ' to , ai n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 11]: `` Well , then , why do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 48]: `` Oh , I 'll do it fast enough to suit YOU , I guess , '' Penrod retorted , swinging the big revolver up a little higher than his shoulder and pointing it in the direction of the double doors , which opened upon the alley .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 11]: `` You better run , Sam , '' he jeered .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 16]: `` You 'll be pretty scared when I shoot her off , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 12]: `` Well , why do n't you SEE if I will ?
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 8]: I bet you 're afraid yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 10]: `` Oh , I am , am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 15]: said Penrod , in a reckless voice -- and his finger touched the trigger .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 28]: It seemed to him that his finger no more than touched it ; perhaps he had been reassured by Sam 's assertion that the trigger was difficult .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 42]: His intentions must remain in doubt , and probably Penrod himself was not certain of them ; but one thing comes to the surface as entirely definite -- that trigger was not so hard to pull as Sam said it was .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 2]: BANG !
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 2]: WH-A-A-ACK !
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 23]: A shattering report split the air of the stable , and there was an orifice of remarkable diameter in the alley door .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 47]: With these phenomena , three yells , expressing excitement of different kinds , were almost simultaneous -- two from within the stable and the third from a point in the alley about eleven inches lower than the orifice just constructed in the planking of the door .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 61]: This third point , roughly speaking , was the open mouth of a gayly dressed young coloured man whose attention , as he strolled , had been thus violently distracted from some mental computations he was making in numbers , including , particularly , those symbols at ecstasy or woe , as the case might be , seven and eleven .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 61]: His eye at once perceived the orifice on a line enervatingly little above the top of his head ; and , although he had not supposed himself so well known in this neighbourhood , he was aware that he did , here and there , possess acquaintances of whom some such uncomplimentary action might be expected as natural and characteristic .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 17]: His immediate procedure was to prostrate himself flat upon the ground , against the stable doors .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 53]: In so doing , his shoulders came brusquely in contact with one of them , which happened to be unfastened , and it swung open , revealing to his gaze two stark-white white boys , one of them holding an enormous pistol and both staring at him in stupor of ultimate horror .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 34]: For , to the glassy eyes of Penrod and Sam , the stratagem of the young coloured man , thus dropping to earth , disclosed , with awful certainty , a slaughtered body .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 51]: This dreadful thing raised itself upon its elbows and looked at them , and there followed a motionless moment -- a tableau of brief duration , for both boys turned and would have fled , shrieking , but the body spoke : '' ` At 's a nice business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 4]: it said reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 4]: `` Nice business !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 10]: Tryin ' blow a man 's head off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 18]: Penrod was unable to speak , but Sam managed to summon the tremulous semblance of a voice .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 10]: `` Where -- where did it hit you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 26]: `` Nemmine anything ` bout where it HIT me , '' the young coloured man returned , dusting his breast and knees as he rose .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 33]: `` I want to know what kine o ' white boys you think you is -- man ca n't walk ` long street ` thout you blowin ' his head off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 24]: He entered the stable and , with an indignation surely justified , took the pistol from the limp , cold hand of Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 8]: `` Whose gun you playin ' with ?
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 8]: Where you git ` at gun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 9]: `` It 's ours , '' quavered Sam .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 7]: `` It belongs to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 18]: `` Then you ' pa ought to be ` rested , '' said the young coloured man .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 9]: `` Lettin ' boys play with gun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 19]: He examined the revolver with an interest in which there began to appear symptoms of a pleasurable appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 6]: `` My goo ` ness !
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 13]: Gun like'iss blow a team o ' steers thew a brick house !
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 7]: LOOK at ` at gun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 21]: With his right hand he twirled it in a manner most dexterous and surprising ; then suddenly he became severe .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 9]: `` You white boy , listen me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 40]: `` Ef I went an did what I OUGHT to did , I 'd march straight out ` iss stable , git a policeman , an ' tell him ` rest you an ' take you off to jail .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 14]: ` At 's what you need -- blowin ' man 's head off !
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 30]: Listen me : I 'm goin ' take ` iss gun an ' th ` ow her away where you ca n't do no mo ' harm with her .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 36]: I 'm goin ' take her way off in the woods an ' th ` ow her away where ca n't nobody fine her an ' go blowin ' man 's head off with her .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 11]: ` At 's what I 'm goin ' do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 31]: And placing the revolver inside his coat as inconspicuously as possible , he proceeded to the open door and into the alley , where he turned for a final word .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 34]: `` I let you off ` iss one time , '' he said , `` but listen me -- you listen , white boy : you bet ' not tell you ' pa .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 20]: _ I _ ain ' goin ' tell him , an ' YOU ain ' goin ' tell him .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 16]: He want know where gun gone , you tell him you los ' her . ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 4]: He disappeared rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 29]: Sam Williams , swallowing continuously , presently walked to the alley door , and remarked in a weak voice , `` I 'm sick at my stummick . ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 15]: He paused , then added more decidedly : `` I 'm goin ' home .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 14]: I guess I 've stood about enough around here for one day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 36]: And bestowing a last glance upon his friend , who was now sitting dumbly upon the floor in the exact spot where he had stood to fire the dreadful shot , Sam moved slowly away .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 43]: The early shades of autumn evening were falling when Penrod emerged from the stable ; and a better light might have disclosed to a shrewd eye some indications that here was a boy who had been extremely , if temporarily , ill .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 22]: He went to the cistern , and , after a cautious glance round the reassuring horizon , lifted the iron cover .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 35]: Then he took from the inner pocket of his jacket an object which he dropped listlessly into the water : it was a bit of wood , whittled to the likeness of a pistol .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 21]: And though his lips moved not , nor any sound issued from his vocal organs , yet were words formed .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 21]: They were so deep in the person of Penrod they came almost from the slowly convalescing profundities of his stomach .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 17]: These words concerned firearms , and they were : `` Wish I 'd never seen one !
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 8]: Never want to see one again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 38]: Of course Penrod had no way of knowing that , as regards bingism in general , several of the most distinguished old gentlemen in Europe were at that very moment in exactly the same state of mind .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 3]: CHAPTER V .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 10]: THE IN-OR-IN Georgie Bassett was a boy set apart .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 14]: Not only that ; Georgie knew that he was a boy set apart .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 30]: He would think about it for ten or twenty minutes at a time , and he could not look at himself in a mirror and remain wholly without emotion .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 37]: What that emotion was , he would have been unable to put into words ; but it helped him to understand that there was a certain noble something about him that other boys did not possess .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 17]: Georgie 's mother had been the first to discover that Georgie was a boy set apart .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 26]: In fact , Georgie did not know it until one day when he happened to overhear his mother telling two of his aunts about it .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 57]: True , he had always understood that he was the best boy in town and he intended to be a minister when he grew up ; but he had never before comprehended the full extent of his sanctity , and , from that fraught moment onward , he had an almost theatrical sense of his set-apartness .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 46]: Penrod Schofield and Sam Williams and the other boys of the neighbourhood all were conscious that there was something different and spiritual about Georgie , and , though this consciousness of theirs may have been a little obscure , it was none the less actual .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 26]: That is to say , they knew that Georgie Bassett was a boy set apart ; but they did not know that they knew it .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 46]: Georgie 's air and manner at all times demonstrated to them that the thing was so , and , moreover , their mothers absorbed appreciation of Georgie 's wonderfulness from the very fount of it , for Mrs. Bassett 's conversation was of little else .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 48]: Thus , the radiance of his character became the topic of envious parental comment during moments of strained patience in many homes , so that altogether the most remarkable fact to be stated of Georgie Bassett is that he escaped the consequences as long as he did .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 36]: Strange as it may seem , no actual violence was done him , except upon the incidental occasion of a tar-fight into which he was drawn by an obvious eccentricity on the part of destiny .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 52]: Naturally , he was not popular with his comrades ; in all games he was pushed aside , and disregarded , being invariably the tail-ender in every pastime in which leaders `` chose sides '' ; his counsels were slighted as worse than weightless , and all his opinions instantly hooted .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 27]: Still , considering the circumstances fairly and thoughtfully , it is difficult to deny that his boy companions showed creditable moderation in their treatment of him .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 33]: That is , they were moderate up to a certain date , and even then they did not directly attack him -- there was nothing cold -- blooded about it at all .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 29]: The thing was forced upon them , and , though they all felt pleased and uplifted -- while it was happening -- they did not understand precisely why .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 39]: Nothing could more clearly prove their innocence of heart than this very ignorance , and yet none of the grown people who later felt themselves concerned in the matter was able to look at it in that light .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 40]: Now , here was a characteristic working of those reactions that produce what is sometimes called `` the injustice of life '' , because the grown people were responsible for the whole affair and were really the guilty parties .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 27]: It was from grown people that Georgie Bassett learned he was a boy set apart , and the effect upon him was what alienated his friends .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 55]: Then these alienated friends were brought -LRB- by odious comparisons on the part of grown people -RRB- to a condition of mind wherein they suffered dumb annoyance , like a low fever , whenever they heard Georgie 's name mentioned , while association with his actual person became every day more and more irritating .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 24]: And yet , having laid this fuse and having kept it constantly glowing , the grown people expected nothing to happen to Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 18]: The catastrophe befell as a consequence of Sam Williams deciding to have a shack in his backyard .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 47]: Sam had somehow obtained a vasty piano-box and a quantity of lumber , and , summoning Penrod Schofield and the coloured brethren , Herman and Verman , he expounded to them his building-plans and offered them shares and benefits in the institution he proposed to found .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 28]: Acceptance was enthusiastic ; straightway the assembly became a union of carpenters all of one mind , and ten days saw the shack not completed but comprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 16]: Anybody could tell , by that time , that it was intended for a shack .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 19]: There was a door on leather hinges ; it drooped , perhaps , but it was a door .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 28]: There was a window -- not a glass one , but , at least , it could be `` looked out of '' , as Sam said .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 33]: There was a chimney made of stovepipe , though that was merely decorative , because the cooking was done out of doors in an underground `` furnace '' that the boys excavated .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 54]: There were pictures pasted on the interior walls , and , hanging from a nail , there was a crayon portrait of Sam 's grandfather , which he had brought down from the attic quietly , though , as he said , it `` was n't any use on earth up there . ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 28]: There were two lame chairs from Penrod 's attic and along one wall ran a low and feeble structure intended to serve as a bench or divan .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 48]: This would come in handy , Sam said , if any of the party `` had to lay down or anything '' , and at a pinch -LRB- such as a meeting of the association -RRB- it would serve to seat all the members in a row .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 18]: For , coincidentally with the development of the shack , the builders became something more than partners .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 54]: Later , no one could remember who first suggested the founding of a secret order , or society , as a measure of exclusiveness and to keep the shack sacred to members only ; but it was an idea that presently began to be more absorbing and satisfactory than even the shack itself .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 31]: The outward manifestations of it might have been observed in the increased solemnity and preoccupation of the Caucasian members and in a few ceremonial observances exposed to the public eye .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 42]: As an instance of these latter , Mrs. Williams , happening to glance from a rearward window , about four o'clock one afternoon , found her attention arrested by what seemed to be a flag-raising before the door of the shack .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 41]: Sam and Herman and Verman stood in attitudes of rigid attention , shoulder to shoulder , while Penrod Schofield , facing them , was apparently delivering some sort of exhortation , which he read from a scribbled sheet of foolscap .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 32]: Concluding this , he lifted from the ground a long and somewhat warped clothes-prop , from one end of which hung a whitish flag , or pennon , bearing an inscription .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 35]: Sam and Herman and Verman lifted their right hands , while Penrod placed the other end of the clothes-prop in a hole in the ground , with the pennon fluttering high above the shack .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 17]: He then raised his own right hand , and the four boys repeated something in concert .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 20]: It was inaudible to Mrs. Williams ; but she was able to make out the inscription upon the pennon .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 29]: It consisted of the peculiar phrase `` In-Or-In '' done in black paint upon a muslin ground , and consequently seeming to be in need of a blotter .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 44]: It recurred to her mind , later that evening , when she happened to find herself alone with Sam in the library , and , in merest idle curiosity , she asked : `` Sam , what does ` In-Or-In ' mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 20]: Sam , bending over an arithmetic , uncreased his brow till it became of a blank and marble smoothness .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 10]: `` What are those words on your flag ? ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 24]: Sam gave her a long , cold , mystic look , rose to his feet and left the room with emphasis and dignity .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 7]: For a moment she was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 68]: But Sam 's older brother was this year completing his education at a university , and Mrs. Williams was not altogether ignorant of the obligations of secrecy imposed upon some brotherhoods ; so she was able to comprehend Sam 's silent withdrawal , and , instead of summoning him back for further questions , she waited until he was out of hearing and then began to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 25]: Sam 's action was in obedience to one of the rules adopted , at his own suggestion , as a law of the order .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 5]: Penrod advocated it warmly .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 22]: From Margaret he had heard accounts of her friends in college and thus had learned much that ought to be done .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 69]: On the other hand , Herman subscribed to it with reluctance , expressing a decided opinion that if he and Verman were questioned upon the matter at home and adopted the line of conduct required by the new rule , it would be well for them to depart not only from the room in which the questioning took place but from the house , and hurriedly at that .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 7]: `` An ' STAY away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 3]: he concluded .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 25]: Verman , being tongue-tied -- not without advantage in this case , and surely an ideal qualification for membership -- was not so apprehensive .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 11]: He voted with Sam and Penrod , carrying the day .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 51]: New rules were adopted at every meeting -LRB- though it can not be said that all of them were practicable -RRB- for , in addition to the information possessed by Sam and Penrod , Herman and Verman had many ideas of their own , founded upon remarks overheard at home .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 32]: Both their parents belonged to secret orders , their father to the Innapenent ` Nevolent Lodge -LRB- so stated by Herman -RRB- and their mother to the Order of White Doves .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 52]: From these and other sources , Penrod found no difficulty in compiling material for what came to be known as the `` rixual '' ; and it was the rixual he was reading to the members when Mrs. Williams happened to observe the ceremonial raising of the emblem of the order .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 62]: The rixual contained the oath , a key to the secret language , or code -LRB- devised by Penrod for use in uncertain emergencies -RRB- and passwords for admission to the shack , also instructions for recognizing a brother member in the dark , and a rather alarming sketch of the things to be done during the initiation of a candidate .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 22]: This last was employed for the benefit of Master Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , on the Saturday following the flag-raising .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 34]: He presented himself in Sam 's yard , not for initiation , indeed -- having no previous knowledge of the Society of the In-Or-In -- but for general purposes of sport and pastime .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 21]: At first sight of the shack he expressed anticipations of pleasure , adding some suggestions for improving the architectural effect .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 49]: Being prevented , however , from entering , and even from standing in the vicinity of the sacred building , he plaintively demanded an explanation ; whereupon he was commanded to withdraw to the front yard for a time , and the members held meeting in the shack .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 11]: Roddy was elected , and consented to undergo the initiation .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 10]: He was not the only new member that day .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 40]: A short time after Roddy had been taken into the shack for the reading of the rixual and other ceremonies , little Maurice Levy entered the Williams ' gate and strolled round to the backyard , looking for Sam .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 23]: He was surprised and delighted to behold the promising shack , and , like Roddy , entertained fair hopes for the future .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 23]: The door of the shack was closed ; a board covered the window , but a murmur of voices came from within .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 6]: Maurice stole close and listened .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 31]: Through a crack he could see the flicker of a candle-flame , and he heard the voice of Penrod Schofield : `` Roddy Bitts , do you solemnly swear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 16]: `` Well , all right , '' said the voice of Roddy , somewhat breathless .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 11]: `` How many fingers you see before your eyes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 10]: `` Ca n't see any , '' Roddy returned .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 22]: `` How could I , with this thing over my eyes , and laying down on my stummick , anyway ? ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 14]: `` Then the time has come , '' Penrod announced in solemn tones .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 7]: `` The time has come . ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 2]: Whack !
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 12]: Evidently a broad and flat implement was thereupon applied to Roddy .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 4]: `` OW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 4]: complained the candidate .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 5]: `` No noise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 16]: said Penrod sternly , and added : `` Roddy Bitts must now say the oath .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 24]: Say exackly what I say , Roddy , and if you do n't -- well , you better , because you 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 19]: Now , say ' I solemnly swear -- ' '' `` I solemnly swear -- '' Roddy said .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 17]: `` To keep the secrets -- '' `` To keep the secrets -- '' Roddy repeated .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 13]: `` To keep the secrets in infadelaty and violate and sanctuary . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 4]: Roddy naturally inquired .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 2]: Whack !
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 4]: `` OW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 3]: cried Roddy .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 7]: `` That 's no fair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 19]: `` You got to say just what _ I _ say , '' Penrod was heard informing him .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 38]: `` That 's the rixual , and anyway , even if you do get it right , Verman 's got to hit you every now and then , because that 's part of the rixual , too .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 8]: Now go on and say it . '
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 16]: I solemnly swear to keep the secrets in infadelaty and violate and sanctuary . '' '
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 9]: `` I solemnly swear -- '' Roddy began .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 23]: But Maurice Levy was tired of being no party to such fascinating proceedings , and he began to hammer upon the door .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 3]: `` Sam !
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 4]: Sam Williams ! ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 6]: `` Lem me in there !
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 8]: I know lots about ` nishiatin ' .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 5]: Lem me in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 43]: The door was flung open , revealing Roddy Bitts , blindfolded and bound , lying face down upon the floor of the shack ; but Maurice had only a fugitive glimpse of this pathetic figure before he , too , was recumbent .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 13]: Four boys flung themselves indignantly upon him and bore him to earth .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 4]: `` Hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 3]: he squealed .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 6]: `` What you doin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 8]: Have n't you got any SENSE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 13]: And , from within the shack , Roddy added his own protest .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 10]: `` Let me up , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 17]: `` I got to see what 's goin ' on out there , have n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 13]: I guess I 'm not goin ' to lay here all DAY !
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 9]: What you think I 'm made of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 6]: `` You hush up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 3]: Penrod commanded .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 8]: `` This is a nice biznuss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 6]: he continued , deeply aggrieved .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 16]: `` What kind of a ` nishiation do you expect this is , anyhow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 26]: `` Well , here 's Maurice Levy gone and seen part of the secrets , '' said Sam , in a voice of equal plaintiveness .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 16]: `` Yes ; and I bet he was listenin ' out here , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 6]: `` Lem me up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 6]: begged Maurice , half stifled .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 15]: `` I did n't do any harm to your old secrets , did I ?
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 11]: Anyways , I just as soon be ` nishiated myself .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 5]: I ai n't afraid .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 20]: So if you ` nishiate me , what difference will it make if I did hear a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 34]: Struck with this idea , which seemed reasonable ; Penrod obtained silence from every one except Roddy , and it was decided to allow Maurice to rise and retire to the front yard .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 23]: The brother members then withdrew within the shack , elected Maurice to the fellowship , and completed the initiation of Mr. Bitts .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 36]: After that , Maurice was summoned and underwent the ordeal with fortitude , though the newest brother -- still tingling with his own experiences -- helped to make certain parts of the rixual unprecedentedly severe .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 20]: Once endowed with full membership , Maurice and Roddy accepted the obligations and privileges of the order with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 20]: Both interested themselves immediately in improvements for the shack , and made excursions to their homes to obtain materials .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 28]: Roddy returned with a pair of lensless mother-of-pearl opera-glasses , a contribution that led to the creation of a new office , called the `` warner '' .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 33]: It was his duty to climb upon the back fence once every fifteen minutes and search the horizon for intruders or `` anybody that has n't got any biznuss around here . ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 48]: This post proved so popular , at first , that it was found necessary to provide for rotation in office , and to shorten the interval from fifteen minutes to an indefinite but much briefer period , determined principally by argument between the incumbent and his successor .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 36]: And Maurice Levy contributed a device so pleasant , and so necessary to the prevention of interruption during meetings , that Penrod and Sam wondered why they had not thought of it themselves long before .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 13]: It consisted of about twenty-five feet of garden hose in fair condition .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 29]: One end of it was introduced into the shack through a knothole , and the other was secured by wire round the faucet of hydrant in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 37]: Thus , if members of the order were assailed by thirst during an important session , or in the course of an initiation , it would not be necessary for them all to leave the shack .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 30]: One could go , instead , and when he had turned on the water at the hydrant , the members in the shack could drink without leaving their places .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 58]: It was discovered , also , that the section of hose could be used as a speaking-tube ; and though it did prove necessary to explain by shouting outside the tube what one had said into it , still there was a general feeling that it provided another means of secrecy and an additional safeguard against intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 29]: It is true that during the half-hour immediately following the installation of this convenience , there was a little violence among the brothers concerning a question of policy .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 35]: Sam , Roddy and Verman -- Verman especially -- wished to use the tube `` to talk through '' and Maurice , Penrod and Herman wished to use it `` to drink through . ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 45]: As a consequence of the success of the latter party , the shack became too damp for habitation until another day , and several members , as they went home at dusk , might easily have been mistaken for survivors of some marine catastrophe .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 17]: Still , not every shack is equipped with running water , and exuberance befitted the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 18]: Everybody agreed that the afternoon had been one of the most successful and important in many weeks .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 29]: The Order of the In-Or-In was doing splendidly , and yet every brother felt , in his heart , that there was one thing that could spoil it .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 24]: Against that fatality , all were united to protect themselves , the shack , the rixual , the opera-glasses and the water-and-speaking tube .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 39]: Sam spoke not only for himself but for the entire order when he declared , in speeding the last parting guest : `` Well , we got to stick to one thing or we might as well quit !
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 10]: GEORGIE BASSETT better not come pokin ' around ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 6]: `` No , SIR ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 3]: said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 8]: GEORGIE BECOMES A MEMBER But Georgie did .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 17]: It is difficult to imagine how cause and effect could be more closely and patently related .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 8]: Inevitably , Georgie did come poking around .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 37]: How was he to refrain when daily , up and down the neighbourhood , the brothers strutted with mystic and important airs , when they whispered together and uttered words of strange import in his presence ?
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 8]: Thus did they defeat their own object .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 19]: They desired to keep Georgie at a distance , yet they could not refrain from posing before him .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 35]: They wished to impress upon him the fact that he was an outsider , and they but succeeded in rousing his desire to be an insider , a desire that soon became a determination .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 21]: For few were the days until he not only knew of the shack but had actually paid it a visit .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 41]: That was upon a morning when the other boys were in school , Georgie having found himself indisposed until about ten o'clock , when he was able to take nourishment and subsequently to interest himself in this rather private errand .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 38]: He climbed the Williams ' alley fence , and , having made a modest investigation of the exterior of the shack , which was padlocked , retired without having disturbed anything except his own peace of mind .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 13]: His curiosity , merely piqued before , now became ravenous and painful .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 98]: It was not allayed by the mystic manners of the members or by the unnecessary emphasis they laid upon their coldness toward himself ; and when a committee informed him darkly that there were `` secret orders '' to prevent his coming within `` a hundred and sixteen feet '' -- such was Penrod 's arbitrary language -- of the Williams ' yard , `` in any direction '' , Georgie could bear it no longer , but entered his own house , and , in burning words , laid the case before a woman higher up .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 12]: Here the responsibility for things is directly traceable to grown people .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 24]: Within that hour , Mrs. Bassett sat in Mrs. Williams 's library to address her hostess upon the subject of Georgie 's grievance .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 22]: `` Of course , it is n't Sam 's fault , '' she said , concluding her interpretation of the affair .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 13]: `` Georgie likes Sam , and did n't blame him at all .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 32]: No ; we both felt that Sam would always be a polite , nice boy -- Georgie used those very words -- but Penrod seems to have a VERY bad influence .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 25]: Georgie felt that Sam would WANT him to come and play in the shack if Penrod did n't make Sam do everything HE wants .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 42]: What hurt Georgie most is that it 's SAM 'S shack , and he felt for another boy to come and tell him that he must n't even go NEAR it -- well , of course , it was very trying .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 13]: And he 's very much hurt with little Maurice Levy , too .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 41]: He said that he was sure that even Penrod would be glad to have him for a member of their little club if it were n't for Maurice -- and I think he spoke of Roddy Bitts , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 26]: The fact that the two remaining members were coloured was omitted from this discourse which leads to the deduction that Georgie had not mentioned it .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 54]: `` Georgie said all the other boys liked him very much , '' Mrs. Bassett continued , `` and that he felt it his duty to join the club , because most of them were so anxious to have him , and he is sure he would have a good influence over them .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 15]: He really did speak of it in quite a touching way , Mrs. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 23]: Of course , we mothers must n't brag of our sons too much , but Georgie REALLY is n't like other boys .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 28]: He is so sensitive , you ca n't think how this little affair has hurt him , and I felt that it might even make him ill .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 16]: You see , I HAD to respect his reason for wanting to join the club .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 49]: And if I AM his mother '' -- she gave a deprecating little laugh -- `` I must say that it seems noble to want to join not really for his own sake but for the good that he felt his influence would have over the other boys .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 10]: Do n't you think so , Mrs. Williams ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 9]: Mrs. Williams said that she did , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 42]: And the result of this interview was another , which took place between Sam and his father that evening , for Mrs. Williams , after talking to Sam herself , felt that the matter needed a man to deal with it .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 6]: The man did it man-fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 29]: `` You either invite Georgie Bassett to play in the shack all he wants to , '' the man said , `` or the shack comes down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 9]: `` But -- '' `` Take your choice .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 23]: I 'm not going to have neighbourhood quarrels over such -- '' `` But , Papa -- '' `` That 's enough !
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 11]: You said yourself you have n't anything against Georgie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 21]: `` I said -- '' `` You said you did n't like him , but you could n't tell why .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 13]: You could n't state a single instance of bad behaviour against him .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 18]: You could n't mention anything he ever did which was n't what a gentleman should have done .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 9]: It 's no use , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 24]: Either you invite Georgie to play in the shack as much as he likes next Saturday , or the shack comes down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 18]: `` But , PAPA -- '' `` I 'm not going to talk any more about it .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 28]: If you want the shack pulled down and hauled away , you and your friends continue to tantalize this inoffensive little boy the way you have been .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 15]: If you want to keep it , be polite and invite him in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 13]: `` But -- '' `` That 's ALL , I said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 4]: Sam was crushed .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 20]: Next day he communicated the bitter substance of the edict to the other members , and gloom became unanimous .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 24]: So serious an aspect did the affair present that it was felt necessary to call a special meeting of the order after school .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 24]: The entire membership was in attendance ; the door was closed , the window covered with a board , and the candle lighted .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 16]: Then all of the brothers -- except one -- began to express their sorrowful apprehensions .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 18]: The whole thing was spoiled , they agreed , if Georgie Bassett had to be taken in .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 22]: On the other hand , if they did n't take him in , `` there would n't be anything left . ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 13]: The one brother who failed to express any opinion was little Verman .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 5]: He was otherwise occupied .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 38]: Verman had been the official paddler during the initiations of Roddy Bitts and Maurice Levy ; his work had been conscientious , and it seemed to be taken by consent that he was to continue in office .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 42]: An old shingle from the woodshed roof had been used for the exercise of his function in the cases of Roddy and Maurice ; but this afternoon he had brought with him a new one that he had picked up somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 33]: It was broader and thicker than the old one and , during the melancholy prophecies of his fellows , he whittled the lesser end of it to the likeness of a handle .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 47]: Thus engaged , he bore no appearance of despondency ; on the contrary , his eyes , shining brightly in the candlelight , indicated that eager thoughts possessed him , while from time to time the sound of a chuckle issued from his simple African throat .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 22]: Gradually the other brothers began to notice his preoccupation , and one by one they fell silent , regarding him thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 22]: Slowly the darkness of their countenances lifted a little ; something happier and brighter began to glimmer from each boyish face .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 7]: All eyes remained fascinated upon Verman .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 23]: `` Well , anyway , '' said Penrod , in a tone that was almost cheerful , `` this is only Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 16]: We got pretty near all week to fix up the ` nishiation for Saturday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 18]: And Saturday brought sunshine to make the occasion more tolerable for both the candidate and the society .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 39]: Mrs. Williams , going to the window to watch Sam when he left the house after lunch , marked with pleasure that his look and manner were sprightly as he skipped down the walk to the front gate .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 9]: There he paused and yodelled for a time .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 18]: An answering yodel came presently ; Penrod Schofield appeared , and by his side walked Georgie Bassett .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 18]: Georgie was always neat ; but Mrs. Williams noticed that he exhibited unusual gloss and polish to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 32]: As for his expression , it was a shade too complacent under the circumstances , though , for that matter , perfect tact avoids an air of triumph under any circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 36]: Mrs. Williams was pleased to observe that Sam and Penrod betrayed no resentment whatever ; they seemed to have accepted defeat in a good spirit and to be inclined to make the best of Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 22]: Indeed , they appeared to be genuinely excited about him -- it was evident that their cordiality was eager and wholehearted .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 24]: The three boys conferred for a few moments ; then Sam disappeared round the house and returned , waving his hand and nodding .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 47]: Upon that , Penrod took Georgie 's left arm , Sam took his right , and the three marched off to the backyard in a companionable way that made Mrs. Williams feel it had been an excellent thing to interfere a little in Georgie 's interest .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 45]: Experiencing the benevolent warmth that comes of assisting in a good action , she ascended to an apartment upstairs , and , for a couple of hours , employed herself with needle and thread in sartorial repairs on behalf of her husband and Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 12]: Then she was interrupted by the advent of a coloured serving-maid .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 14]: `` Miz Williams , I reckon the house goin ' fall down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 9]: this pessimist said , arriving out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 24]: `` That s ` iety o ' Mist ' Sam 's suttenly tryin ' to pull the roof down on ow haids ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 5]: `` The roof ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 5]: Mrs. Williams inquired mildly .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 12]: `` They are n't in the attic , are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 17]: `` No 'm ; they in the celluh , but they REACHIN ' fer the roof !
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 34]: I nev ' did hear no sech a rumpus an ' squawkin ' an ' squawlin ' an ' fallin ' an ' whoopin ' an ' whackin ' an ' bangin ' !
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 14]: They troop down by the outside celluh do ' , n'en -- bang !
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 20]: -- they bus ' loose , an ' been goin ' on ev ' since , wuss 'n Bedlun !
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 36]: Ef they anything down celluh ain ' broke by this time , it cain ' be only jes ' the foundashum , an ' I bet THAT ain ' goin ' stan ' much longer !
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 16]: I 'd gone down an ' stop 'em , but I 'm ` fraid to .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 25]: Hones ' , Miz Williams , I 'm ` fraid o ' my life go down there , all that Bedlun goin ' on .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 10]: I thought I come see what you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 4]: Mrs. Williams laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 20]: `` We have to stand a little noise in the house sometimes , Fanny , when there are boys .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 18]: They 're just playing , and a lot of noise is usually a pretty safe sign . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 8]: `` Yes 'm , '' Fanny said .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 13]: `` It 's yo ' house , Miz Williams , not mine .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 13]: You want 'em tear it down , I 'm willin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 10]: She departed , and Mrs. Williams continued to sew .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 33]: The days were growing short , and at five o'clock she was obliged to put the work aside , as her eyes did not permit her to continue it by artificial light .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 45]: Descending to the lower floor , she found the house silent , and when she opened the front door to see if the evening paper had come , she beheld Sam , Penrod and Maurice Levy standing near the gate engaged in quiet conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 20]: Penrod and Maurice departed while she was looking for the paper , and Sam came thoughtfully up the walk .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 34]: `` Well , Sam , '' she said , `` it was n't such a bad thing , after all , to show a little politeness to Georgie Bassett , was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 18]: Sam gave her a non-committal look -- expression of every kind had been wiped from his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 6]: He presented a blank surface .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 9]: `` No 'm , '' he said meekly .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 18]: `` Everything was just a little pleasanter because you 'd been friendly , was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 7]: `` Has Georgie gone home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 19]: `` I hear you made enough noise in the cellar -- Did Georgie have a good time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 10]: `` Did Georgie Bassett have a good time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 40]: `` Well '' -- Sam now had the air of a person trying to remember details with absolute accuracy -- `` well , he did n't say he did , and he did n't say he did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 9]: `` Did n't he thank the boys ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 5]: `` No 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 9]: `` Did n't he even thank you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 5]: `` No 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 11]: `` Why , that 's queer , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 7]: `` He 's always so polite .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 16]: He SEEMED to be having a good time , did n't he , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 11]: `` Did n't Georgie seem to be enjoying himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 13]: This question , apparently so simple , was not answered with promptness .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 32]: Sam looked at his mother in a puzzled way , and then he found it necessary to rub each of his shins in turn with the palm of his right hand .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 9]: `` I stumbled , '' he said apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 9]: `` I stumbled on the cellar steps . ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 7]: `` Did you hurt yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 4]: she asked quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 25]: `` No 'm ; but I guess maybe I better rub some arnica -- '' `` I 'll get it , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 11]: `` Come up to your father 's bathroom , Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 6]: Does it hurt much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 17]: `` No 'm , '' he answered truthfully , `` it hardly hurts at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 29]: And having followed her to the bathroom , he insisted , with unusual gentleness , that he be left to apply the arnica to the alleged injuries himself .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 29]: He was so persuasive that she yielded , and descended to the library , where she found her husband once more at home after his day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 14]: `` Did Georgie show up , and were they decent to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 10]: `` Oh , yes ; it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 8]: Sam and Penrod were good as gold .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 10]: I saw them being actually cordial to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 18]: `` That 's well , '' Mr. Williams said , settling into a chair with his paper .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 14]: `` I was a little apprehensive , but I suppose I was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 40]: I walked home , and just now , as I passed Mrs. Bassett 's , I saw Doctor Venny 's car in front , and that barber from the corner shop on Second Street was going in the door .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 22]: I could n't think what a widow would need a barber and a doctor for -- especially at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 27]: I could n't think what Georgie 'd need such a combination for either , and then I got afraid that maybe -- '' Mrs. Williams laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 18]: `` Oh , no ; it has n't anything to do with his having been over here .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 11]: I 'm sure they were very nice to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 10]: `` Well , I 'm glad of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 20]: `` Yes , indeed -- '' Mrs. Williams began , when Fanny appeared , summoning her to the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 16]: It is pathetically true that Mrs. Williams went to the telephone humming a little song .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 28]: She was detained at the instrument not more than five minutes ; then she made a plunging return into the library , a blanched and stricken woman .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 10]: She made strange , sinister gestures at her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 7]: He sprang up , miserably prophetic .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 5]: `` Mrs. Bassett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 21]: `` Go to the telephone , '' Mrs. Williams said hoarsely `` She wants to talk to you , too .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 10]: She CA N'T talk much -- she 's hysterical .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 15]: She says they lured Georgie into the cellar and had him beaten by negroes !
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 14]: That 's not all -- '' Mr. Williams was already on his way .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 6]: `` You find Sam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 7]: he commanded , over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 8]: Mrs. Williams stepped into the front hall .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 4]: `` Sam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 11]: she called , addressing the upper reaches of the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 4]: `` Sam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 5]: Not even echo answered .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 4]: `` SAM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 52]: A faint clearing of somebody 's throat was heard behind her , a sound so modest and unobtrusive it was no more than just audible , and , turning , the mother beheld her son sitting upon the floor in the shadow of the stairs and gazing meditatively at the hatrack .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 44]: His manner indicated that he wished to produce the impression that he had been sitting there , in this somewhat unusual place and occupation , for a considerable time , but without overhearing anything that went on in the library so close by .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 14]: `` Sam , '' she cried , `` what have you DONE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 16]: `` Well -- I guess my legs are all right , '' he said gently .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 22]: `` I got the arnica on , so probably they wo n't hurt any m -- '' `` Stand up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 7]: `` March into the library ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 5]: Sam marched -- slow-time .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 23]: In fact , no funeral march has been composed in a time so slow as to suit this march of Sam 's .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 13]: One might have suspected that he was in a state of apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 24]: Mr. Williams entered at one door as his son crossed the threshold of the other , and this encounter was a piteous sight .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 19]: After one glance at his father 's face , Sam turned desperately , as if to flee outright .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 10]: But Mrs. Williams stood in the doorway behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 6]: `` You come here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 12]: And the father 's voice was as terrible as his face .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 10]: `` WHAT DID YOU DO TO GEORGIE BASSETT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 15]: `` Nothin ' , '' Sam gulped ; `` nothin ' at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 11]: `` We just -- we just ` nishiated him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 20]: Mr. Williams turned abruptly , walked to the fireplace , and there turned again , facing the wretched Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 8]: `` That 's all you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 45]: `` Georgie Bassett 's mother has just told me over the telephone , '' Mr. Williams said , deliberately , `` that you and Penrod Schofield and Roderick Bitts and Maurice Levy LURED GEORGIE INTO THE CELLAR AND HAD HIM BEATEN BY NEGROES ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 21]: At this , Sam was able to hold up his head a little and to summon a rather feeble indignation .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 10]: `` It ai n't so , '' he declared .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 13]: `` We did n't any such thing lower him into the cellar .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 11]: We were n't goin ' NEAR the cellar with him .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 9]: We never THOUGHT of goin ' down cellar .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 9]: He went down there himself , first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 3]: `` So !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 12]: I suppose he was running away from you , poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 11]: Trying to escape from you , was n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 10]: `` He was n't , '' Sam said doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 14]: `` We were n't chasin ' him -- or anything at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 11]: `` Then why did he go in the cellar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 17]: `` Well , he did n't exactly GO in the cellar , '' Sam said reluctantly .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 14]: `` Well , how did he GET in the cellar , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 11]: `` He -- he fell in , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 8]: `` HOW did he fall in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 83]: `` Well , the door was open , and -- well , he kept walkin ' around there , and we hollered at him to keep away , but just then he kind of -- well , the first _ I _ noticed was I could n't SEE him , and so we went and looked down the steps , and he was sitting down there on the bottom step and kind of shouting , and -- '' `` See here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 4]: Mr. Williams interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 18]: `` You 're going to make a clean breast of this whole affair and take the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 11]: You 're going to tell it and tell it ALL .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 6]: Do you understand that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 20]: `` Then you tell me how Georgie Bassett fell down the cellar steps -- and tell me quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 8]: `` He -- he was blindfolded . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 3]: `` Aha !
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 7]: NOW we 're getting at it .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 21]: You begin at the beginning and tell me just what you did to him from the time he got here .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 3]: Understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 7]: `` Go on , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 13]: `` Well , I 'm goin ' to , '' Sam protested .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 8]: `` We never hurt him at all .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 11]: He was n't even hurt when he fell down cellar .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 22]: There 's a lot of mud down there , because the cellar door leaks , and -- '' `` Sam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 7]: Mr. Williams 's tone was deadly .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 14]: `` Did you hear me tell you to begin at the beginning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 11]: Sam made a great effort and was able to obey .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 18]: `` Well , we had everything ready for the ` nishiation before lunch , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 187]: `` We wanted it all to be nice , because you said we had to have him , papa , and after lunch Penrod went to guard him -- that 's a new part in the rixual -- and he brought him over , and we took him out to the shack and blindfolded him , and -- well , he got kind of mad because we wanted him to lay down on his stummick and be tied up , and he said he would n't , because the floor was a little bit wet in there and he could feel it sort of squashy under his shoes , and he said his mother did n't want him ever to get dirty and he just would n't do it ; and we all kept telling him he had to , or else how could there be any ` nishiation ; and he kept gettin ' madder and said he wanted to have the ` nishiation outdoors where it was n't wet and he was n't goin ' to lay down on his stummick , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 52]: Sam paused for wind , then got under way again : `` Well , some of the boys were tryin ' to get him to lay down on his stummick , and he kind of fell up against the door and it came open and he ran out in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 47]: He was tryin ' to get the blindfold off his eyes , but he could n't because it was a towel in a pretty hard knot ; and he went tearin ' all around the backyard , and we did n't chase him , or anything .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 18]: All we did was just watch him -- and that 's when he fell in the cellar .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 9]: Well , it did n't hurt him any .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 32]: It did n't hurt him at all ; but he was muddier than what he would of been if he 'd just had sense enough to lay down in the shack .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 30]: Well , so we thought , long as he was down in the cellar anyway , we might as well have the rest of the ` nishiation down there .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 18]: So we brought the things down and -- and ` nishiated him -- and that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 10]: That 's every bit we did to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' Mr. Williams said sardonically ; `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 9]: What were the details of the initiation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 4]: `` Sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 12]: `` I want to know what else you did to him ?
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 6]: What was the initiation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 13]: `` It 's -- it 's secret , '' Sam murmured piteously .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 9]: `` Not any longer , I assure you !
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 23]: The society is a thing of the past and you 'll find your friend Penrod 's parents agree with me in that .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 12]: Mrs. Bassett had already telephoned them when she called us up .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 8]: You go on with your story ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 25]: Sam sighed deeply , and yet it may have been a consolation to know that his present misery was not altogether without its counterpart .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 28]: Through the falling dusk his spirit may have crossed the intervening distance to catch a glimpse of his friend suffering simultaneously and standing within the same peril .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 18]: And if Sam 's spirit did thus behold Penrod in jeopardy , it was a true vision .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 5]: `` Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 4]: Mr. Williams said .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 45]: `` Well , there was n't any fire in the furnace because it 's too warm yet , and we were n't goin ' to do anything 'd HURT him , so we put him in there -- '' `` In the FURNACE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 9]: `` It was cold , '' Sam protested .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 12]: `` There had n't been any fire there since last spring .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 10]: Course we told him there was fire in it .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 21]: We HAD to do that , '' he continued earnestly , `` because that was part of the ` nishiation .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 62]: We only kept him in it a little while and kind of hammered on the outside a little and then we took him out and got him to lay down on his stummick , because he was all muddy anyway , where he fell down the cellar ; and how could it matter to anybody that had any sense at all ?
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 27]: Well , then we had the rixual , and -- and -- why , the teeny little paddlin ' he got would n't hurt a flea !
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 39]: It was that little coloured boy lives in the alley did it -- he is n't anyways near HALF Georgie 's size but Georgie got mad and said he did n't want any ole nigger to paddle him .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 62]: That 's what he said , and it was his own foolishness , because Verman wo n't let ANYBODY call him ` nigger ' , and if Georgie was goin ' to call him that he ought to had sense enough not to do it when he was layin ' down that way and Verman all ready to be the paddler .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 54]: And he need n't of been so mad at the rest of us , either , because it took us about twenty minutes to get the paddle away from Verman after that , and we had to lock Verman up in the laundry-room and not let him out till it was all over .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 29]: Well , and then things were kind of spoiled , anyway ; so we did n't do but just a little more -- and that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 4]: `` Go on !
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 11]: What was the ` just a little more ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 28]: `` Well -- we got him to swaller a little teeny bit of asafidity that Penrod used to have to wear in a bag around his neck .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 37]: It was n't enough to even make a person sneeze -- it was n't much more 'n a half a spoonful -- it was n't hardly a QUARTER of a spoonf -- '' `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 4]: said Mr. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 7]: `` That accounts for the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 4]: What else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 35]: `` Well -- we -- we had some paint left over from our flag , and we put just a little teeny bit of it on his hair and -- '' `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 4]: said Mr. Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 7]: `` That accounts for the barber .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 4]: What else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 11]: `` That 's all , '' Sam said , swallowing .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 10]: `` Then he got mad and went home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 19]: Mr. Williams walked to the door , and sternly motioned to the culprit to precede him through it .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 19]: But just before the pair passed from her sight , Mrs. Williams gave way to an uncontrollable impulse .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 17]: `` Sam , '' she asked , `` what does ` In-Or-In ' stand for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 8]: The unfortunate boy had begun to sniffle .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 22]: `` It -- it means -- Innapenent Order of Infadelaty , '' he moaned -- and plodded onward to his doom .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 63]: Not his alone : at that very moment Master Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior , was suffering also , consequent upon telephoning on the part of Mrs. Bassett , though Roderick 's punishment was administered less on the ground of Georgie 's troubles and more on that of Roddy 's having affiliated with an order consisting so largely of Herman and Verman .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 12]: As for Maurice Levy , he was no whit less unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 5]: He fared as ill .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 13]: Simultaneously , two ex-members of the In-Or-In were finding their lot fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 41]: Something had prompted them to linger in the alley in the vicinity of the shack , and it was to this fated edifice that Mr. Williams , with demoniac justice , brought Sam for the deed he had in mind .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 15]: Herman and Verman listened -- awe-stricken -- to what went on within the shack .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 19]: Then , before it was over , they crept away and down the alley toward their own home .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 29]: This was directly across the alley from the Schofields ' stable , and they were horrified at the sounds that issued from the interior of the stable store-room .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 11]: It was the St. Bartholomew 's Eve of that neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 6]: `` Man , man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 7]: said Herman , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 10]: `` Glad I ain ' no white boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 6]: Verman seemed gloomily to assent .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 13]: WHITEY Penrod and Sam made a gloomy discovery one morning in mid-October .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 32]: All the week had seen amiable breezes and fair skies until Saturday , when , about breakfast-time , the dome of heaven filled solidly with gray vapour and began to drip .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 14]: The boys ' discovery was that there is no justice about the weather .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 57]: They sat in the carriage-house of the Schofields ' empty stable ; the doors upon the alley were open , and Sam and Penrod stared torpidly at the thin but implacable drizzle that was the more irritating because there was barely enough of it to interfere with a number of things they had planned to do .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 8]: `` Yes ; this is NICE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 10]: Sam said , in a tone of plaintive sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 10]: `` This is a PERTY way to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 13]: -LRB- He was alluding to the personal spitefulness of the elements . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 36]: `` I 'd like to know what 's the sense of it -- ole sun pourin ' down every day in the week when nobody needs it , then cloud up and rain all Saturday !
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 16]: My father said it 's goin ' to be a three days ' rain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 19]: `` Well , nobody with any sense cares if it rains Sunday and Monday , '' Penrod said .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 33]: `` I would n't care if it rained every Sunday as long I lived ; but I just like to know what 's the reason it had to go and rain to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 18]: Got all the days o ' the week to choose from and goes and picks on Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 9]: That 's a fine biz ` nuss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 23]: `` Well , in vacation -- '' Sam began ; but at a sound from a source invisible to him he paused .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 6]: he said , somewhat startled .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 20]: It was a curious sound , loud and hollow and unhuman , yet it seemed to be a cough .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 18]: Both boys rose , and Penrod asked uneasily : `` Where 'd that noise come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 11]: `` It 's in the alley , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 37]: Perhaps if the day had been bright , both of them would have stepped immediately to the alley doors to investigate ; but their actual procedure was to move a little distance in the opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 6]: The strange cough sounded again .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 4]: `` SAY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 3]: Penrod quavered .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 6]: `` What IS that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 24]: Then both boys uttered smothered exclamations and jumped , for the long , gaunt head that appeared in the doorway was entirely unexpected .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 17]: It was the cavernous and melancholy head of an incredibly thin , old , whitish horse .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 24]: This head waggled slowly from side to side ; the nostrils vibrated ; the mouth opened , and the hollow cough sounded again .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 16]: Recovering themselves , Penrod and Sam underwent the customary human reaction from alarm to indignation .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 12]: `` What you want , you ole horse , you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 3]: Penrod shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 11]: `` Do n't you come coughin ' around ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 13]: And Sam , seizing a stick , hurled it at the intruder .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 8]: `` Get out o ' here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 40]: The aged horse nervously withdrew his head , turned tail , and made a rickety flight up the alley , while Sam and Penrod , perfectly obedient to inherited impulse , ran out into the drizzle and uproariously pursued .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 11]: They were but automatons of instinct , meaning no evil .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 28]: Certainly they did not know the singular and pathetic history of the old horse who wandered into the alley and ventured to look through the open door .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 23]: This horse , about twice the age of either Penrod or Sam , had lived to find himself in a unique position .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 41]: He was nude , possessing neither harness nor halter ; all he had was a name , Whitey , and he would have answered to it by a slight change of expression if any one had thus properly addressed him .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 21]: So forlorn was Whitey 's case , he was actually an independent horse ; he had not even an owner .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 13]: For two days and a half he had been his own master .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 31]: Previous to that period he had been the property of one Abalene Morris , a person of colour , who would have explained himself as engaged in the hauling business .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 51]: On the contrary , the hauling business was an insignificant side line with Mr. Morris , for he had long ago given himself , as utterly as fortune permitted , to the talent that early in youth he had recognized as the greatest of all those surging in his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 33]: In his waking thoughts and in his dreams , in health and in sickness , Abalene Morris was the dashing and emotional practitioner of an art probably more than Roman in antiquity .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 5]: Abalene was a crap-shooter .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 7]: The hauling business was a disguise .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 41]: A concentration of events had brought it about that , at one and the same time , Abalene , after a dazzling run of the dice , found the hauling business an actual danger to the preservation of his liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 31]: He won seventeen dollars and sixty cents , and within the hour found himself in trouble with an officer of the Humane Society on account of an altercation with Whitey .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 37]: Abalene had been offered four dollars for Whitey some ten days earlier ; wherefore he at once drove to the shop of the junk-dealer who had made the offer and announced his acquiescence in the sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 6]: `` No , suh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 37]: the junk-dealer said , with emphasis , `` I awready done got me a good mule fer my deliv ` ry hoss , 'n' at ole Whitey hoss ain ' wuff no fo ' dollah nohow !
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 20]: I ` uz a fool when I talk ` bout th ` owin ' money roun ' that a-way .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 11]: _ I _ know what YOU up to , Abalene .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 25]: Man come by here li'l bit ago tole me all ` bout white man try to ` rest you , ovah on the avvynoo .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 26]: Yessuh ; he say white man goin ' to git you yit an ' th ` ow you in jail ` count o ' Whitey .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 11]: White man tryin ' to fine out who you IS .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 21]: He say , nemmine , he 'll know Whitey ag ` in , even if he don ' know you !
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 36]: He say he ketch you by the hoss ; so you come roun ' tryin ' fix me up with Whitey so white man grab me , th ` ow ME in ` at jail .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 11]: G'on ` way f ` um hyuh , you Abalene !
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 20]: You cain ' sell an ' you cain ' give Whitey to no cullud man 'n ` is town .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 26]: You go an ' drowned ` at ole hoss , 'cause you sutny goin ' to jail if you git ketched drivin ' him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 33]: The substance of this advice seemed good to Abalene , especially as the seventeen dollars and sixty cents in his pocket lent sweet colours to life out of jail at this time .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 21]: At dusk he led Whitey to a broad common at the edge of town , and spoke to him finally .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 20]: `` G'on ` bout you biz ` nis , '' said Abalene ; `` you ain ' MY hoss .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 21]: Don ' look roun ` at me , 'cause _ I _ ai n't got no ` quaintance wif you .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 27]: I 'm a man o ' money , an ' I got my own frien 's ; I 'm a-lookin ' fer bigger cities , hoss .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 12]: You got you biz ` nis an ' I got mine .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 7]: Mista ' Hoss , good-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 15]: Whitey found a little frosted grass upon the common and remained there all night .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 29]: In the morning he sought the shed where Abalene had kept him ; but that was across the large and busy town , and Whitey was hopelessly lost .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 56]: He had but one eye , a feeble one , and his legs were not to be depended upon ; but he managed to cover a great deal of ground , to have many painful little adventures , and to get monstrously hungry and thirsty before he happened to look in upon Penrod and Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 24]: When the two boys chased him up the alley they had no intention to cause pain ; they had no intention at all .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 42]: They were no more cruel than Duke , Penrod 's little old dog , who followed his own instincts , and , making his appearance hastily through a hole in the back fence , joined the pursuit with sound and fury .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 24]: A boy will nearly always run after anything that is running , and his first impulse is to throw a stone at it .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 18]: This is a survival of primeval man , who must take every chance to get his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 44]: So , when Penrod and Sam drove the hapless Whitey up the alley , they were really responding to an impulse thousands and thousands of years old -- an impulse founded upon the primordial observation that whatever runs is likely to prove edible .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 14]: Penrod and Sam were not `` bad '' ; they were never that .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 13]: They were something that was not their fault ; they were historic .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 61]: At the next corner Whitey turned to the right into the cross-street ; thence , turning to the right again and still warmly pursued , he zigzagged down a main thoroughfare until he reached another cross-street , which ran alongside the Schofields ' yard and brought him to the foot of the alley he had left behind in his flight .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 20]: He entered the alley , and there his dim eye fell upon the open door he had previously investigated .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 81]: No memory of it remained ; but the place had a look associated in his mind with hay , and , as Sam and Penrod turned the corner of the alley in panting yet still vociferous pursuit , Whitey stumbled up the inclined platform before the open doors , staggered thunderously across the carriage-house and through another open door into a stall , an apartment vacant since the occupancy of Mr. Schofield 's last horse , now several years deceased .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 17]: SALVAGE The two boys shrieked with excitement as they beheld the coincidence of this strange return .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 22]: They burst into the stable , making almost as much noise as Duke , who had become frantic at the invasion .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 7]: Sam laid hands upon a rake .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 15]: `` You get out o ' there , you ole horse , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 3]: he bellowed .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 10]: `` I ai n't afraid to drive him out .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 9]: I -- '' `` WAIT a minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 3]: Penrod shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 15]: `` Wait till I -- '' Sam was manfully preparing to enter the stall .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 25]: `` You hold the doors open , '' he commanded , `` so 's they wo n't blow shut and keep him in here .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 13]: I 'm goin ' to hit him -- '' `` Quee-YUT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 17]: Penrod shouted , grasping the handle of the rake so that Sam could not use it .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 10]: `` Wait a MINUTE , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 10]: He turned with ferocious voice and gestures upon Duke .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 4]: `` DUKE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 27]: And Duke , in spite of his excitement , was so impressed that he prostrated himself in silence , and then unobtrusively withdrew from the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 10]: Penrod ran to the alley doors and closed them .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 5]: `` My gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 3]: Sam protested .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 9]: `` What you goin ' to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 24]: `` I 'm goin ' to keep this horse , '' said Penrod , whose face showed the strain of a great idea .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 5]: `` What FOR ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 10]: `` For the reward , '' said Penrod simply .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 15]: Sam sat down in the wheelbarrow and stared at his friend almost with awe .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 16]: `` My gracious , '' he said , `` I never thought o ' that !
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 14]: How -- how much do you think we 'll get , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 27]: Sam 's thus admitting himself to a full partnership in the enterprise met no objection from Penrod , who was absorbed in the contemplation of Whitey .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 20]: `` Well , '' he said judicially , `` we might get more and we might get less . ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 15]: Sam rose and joined his friend in the doorway opening upon the two stalls .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 18]: Whitey had preempted the nearer , and was hungrily nuzzling the old frayed hollows in the manger .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 10]: `` Maybe a hunderd dollars -- or sumpthing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 7]: Sam asked in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 19]: Penrod maintained his composure and repeated the newfound expression that had sounded well to him a moment before .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 19]: He recognized it as a symbol of the non -- committal attitude that makes people looked up to .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 24]: `` Well '' -- he made it slow , and frowned -- `` we might get more and we might get less . ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 8]: `` More 'n a hunderd DOLLARS ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 3]: Sam gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 19]: `` Well , '' said Penrod , `` we might get more and we might get less . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 13]: This time , however , he felt the need of adding something .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 31]: He put a question in an indulgent tone , as though he were inquiring , not to add to his own information but to discover the extent of Sam 's .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 13]: `` How much do you think horses are worth , anyway ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 30]: `` I do n't know , '' Sam said frankly , and , unconsciously , he added , `` They might be more and they might be less . ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 26]: `` Well , when our ole horse died , '' Penrod said , `` Papa said he would n't taken five hunderd dollars for him .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 9]: That 's how much HORSES are worth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 5]: `` My gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 3]: Sam exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 7]: Then he had a practical afterthought .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 13]: `` But maybe he was a better horse than this ` n .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 6]: What colour was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 5]: `` He was bay .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 46]: Looky here , Sam '' -- and now Penrod 's manner changed from the superior to the eager -- `` you look what kind of horses they have in a circus , and you bet a circus has the BEST horses , do n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 13]: Well , what kind of horses do they have in a circus ?
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 18]: They have some black and white ones ; but the best they have are white all over .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 13]: Well , what kind of a horse is this we got here ?
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 27]: He 's perty near white right now , and I bet if we washed him off and got him fixed up nice he WOULD be white .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 28]: Well , a bay horse is worth five hunderd dollars , because that 's what Papa said , and this horse -- '' Sam interrupted rather timidly .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 10]: `` He -- he 's awful bony , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 14]: You do n't guess they 'd make any -- '' Penrod laughed contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 3]: `` Bony !
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 19]: All he needs is a little food and he 'll fill right up and look good as ever .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 13]: You do n't know much about horses , Sam , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 17]: Why , OUR ole horse -- '' `` Do you expect he 's hungry now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 7]: asked Sam , staring at Whitey .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 10]: `` Let 's try him , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 17]: `` Horses like hay and oats the best ; but they 'll eat most anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 6]: `` I guess they will .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 23]: He 's tryin ' to eat that manger up right now , and I bet it ai n't good for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 18]: `` Come on , '' said Penrod , closing the door that gave entrance to the stalls .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 18]: `` We got to get this horse some drinkin ' - water and some good food . ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 21]: They tried Whitey 's appetite first with an autumnal branch that they wrenched from a hardy maple in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 32]: They had seen horses nibble leaves , and they expected Whitey to nibble the leaves of this branch ; but his ravenous condition did not allow him time for cool discriminations .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 24]: Sam poked the branch at him from the passageway , and Whitey , after one backward movement of alarm , seized it venomously .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 3]: `` Here !
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 5]: You stop that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 3]: Sam shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 12]: `` You stop that , you ole horse , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 13]: called Penrod from the hydrant , where he was filling a bucket .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 9]: `` What 's he doin ' now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 4]: `` Doin ' !
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 10]: He 's eatin ' the wood part , too !
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 12]: He 's chewin ' up sticks as big as baseball bats !
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 5]: He 's crazy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 11]: Penrod rushed to see this sight , and stood aghast .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 10]: `` Take it away from him , Sam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 4]: he commanded sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 12]: `` Go on , take it away from him yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 8]: was the prompt retort of his comrade .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 17]: `` You had no biz ` nuss to give it to him , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 14]: `` Anybody with any sense ought to know it 'd make him sick .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 14]: What 'd you want to go and give it to him for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 11]: `` Well , you did n't say not to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 9]: `` Well , what if I did n't ?
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 9]: I never said I did , did I ?
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 14]: You go on in that stall and take it away from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 7]: `` YES , I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 4]: Sam returned bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 33]: Then , as Whitey had dragged the remains of the branch from the manger to the floor of the stall , Sam scrambled to the top of the manger and looked over .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 10]: `` There ai n't much left to TAKE away !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 9]: He 's swallered it all except some splinters .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 14]: Better give him the water to try and wash it down with . ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 17]: And , as Penrod complied , `` My gracious , look at that horse DRINK ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 16]: They gave Whitey four buckets of water , and then debated the question of nourishment .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 35]: Obviously , this horse could not be trusted with branches , and , after getting their knees black and their backs sodden , they gave up trying to pull enough grass to sustain him .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 42]: Then Penrod remembered that horses like apples , both `` cooking-apples '' and `` eating-apples '' , and Sam mentioned the fact that every autumn his father received a barrel of `` cooking-apples '' from a cousin who owned a farm .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 34]: That barrel was in the Williams ' cellar now , and the cellar was providentially supplied with `` outside doors , '' so that it could be visited without going through the house .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 9]: Sam and Penrod set forth for the cellar .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 50]: They returned to the stable bulging , and , after a discussion of Whitey 's digestion -LRB- Sam claiming that eating the core and seeds , as Whitey did , would grow trees in his inside -RRB- they went back to the cellar for supplies again -- and again .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 23]: They made six trips , carrying each time a capacity cargo of apples , and still Whitey ate in a famished manner .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 36]: They were afraid to take more apples from the barrel , which began to show conspicuously the result of their raids , wherefore Penrod made an unostentatious visit to the cellar of his own house .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 39]: From the inside he opened a window and passed vegetables out to Sam , who placed them in a bucket and carried them hurriedly to the stable , while Penrod returned in a casual manner through the house .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 35]: Of his sang-froid under a great strain it is sufficient to relate that , in the kitchen , he said suddenly to Della , the cook , `` Oh , look behind you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 32]: and by the time Della discovered that there was nothing unusual behind her , Penrod was gone , and a loaf of bread from the kitchen table was gone with him .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 23]: Whitey now ate nine turnips , two heads of lettuce , one cabbage , eleven raw potatoes and the loaf of bread .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 26]: He ate the loaf of bread last and he was a long time about it ; so the boys came to a not unreasonable conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 16]: `` Well , sir , I guess we got him filled up at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 3]: said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 22]: `` I bet he would n't eat a saucer of ice-cream now , if we 'd give it to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 16]: `` He looks better to me , '' said Sam , staring critically at Whitey .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 13]: `` I think he 's kind of begun to fill out some .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 21]: I expect he must like us , Penrod ; we been doin ' a good deal for this horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 16]: `` Well , we got to keep it up , '' Penrod insisted rather pompously .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 23]: `` Long as _ I _ got charge o ' this horse , he 's goin ' to get good treatment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 10]: `` What we better do now , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 10]: Penrod took on the outward signs of deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 12]: `` Well , there 's plenty to DO , all right .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 6]: I got to think . ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 19]: Sam made several suggestions , which Penrod -- maintaining his air of preoccupation -- dismissed with mere gestures .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 9]: `` Oh , _ I _ know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 4]: Sam cried finally .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 18]: `` We ought to wash him so 's he 'll look whiter 'n what he does now .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 12]: We can turn the hose on him across the manger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 10]: `` No ; not yet , '' Penrod said .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 9]: `` It 's too soon after his meal .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 7]: You ought to know that yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 24]: What we got to do is to make up a bed for him -- if he wants to lay down or anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 9]: `` Make up a what for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 5]: Sam echoed , dumfounded .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 7]: `` What you talkin ' about ?
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 11]: How can -- '' `` Sawdust , '' Penrod said .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 16]: `` That 's the way the horse we used to have used to have it .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 28]: We 'll make this horse 's bed in the other stall , and then he can go in there and lay down whenever he wants to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 10]: `` How we goin ' to do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 13]: `` Look , Sam ; there 's the hole into the sawdust-box !
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 37]: All you got to do is walk in there with the shovel , stick the shovel in the hole till it gets full of sawdust , and then sprinkle it around on the empty stall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 10]: `` All _ I _ got to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 3]: Sam cried .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 10]: `` What are you goin ' to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 15]: `` I 'm goin ' to be right here , '' Penrod answered reassuringly .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 31]: `` He wo n't kick or anything , and it is n't goin ' to take you half a second to slip around behind him to the other stall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 11]: `` What makes you think he wo n't kick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 25]: `` Well , I KNOW he wo n't , and , besides , you could hit him with the shovel if he tried to .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 13]: Anyhow , I 'll be right here , wo n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 14]: `` I do n't care where you are , '' Sam said earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 28]: `` What difference would that make if he ki -- '' `` Why , you were goin ' right in the stall , '' Penrod reminded him .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 31]: `` When he first came in , you were goin ' to take the rake and -- '' `` I do n't care if I was , '' Sam declared .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 7]: `` I was excited then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 14]: `` Well , you can get excited now , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 4]: his friend urged .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 29]: `` You can just as easy get -- '' He was interrupted by a shout from Sam , who was keeping his eye upon Whitey throughout the discussion .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 3]: `` Look !
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 4]: Looky there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 18]: And undoubtedly renewing his excitement , Sam pointed at the long , gaunt head beyond the manger .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 6]: It was disappearing from view .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 4]: `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 3]: Sam shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 8]: `` He 's layin ' down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 21]: `` Well , then , '' said Penrod , `` I guess he 's goin ' to take a nap .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 28]: If he wants to lay down without waitin ' for us to get the sawdust fixed for him , that 's his lookout , not ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 12]: On the contrary , Sam perceived a favourable opportunity for action .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 22]: `` I just as soon go and make his bed up while he 's layin ' down , '' he volunteered .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 73]: `` You climb up on the manger and watch him , Penrod , and I 'll sneak in the other stall and fix it all up nice for him , so 's he can go in there any time when he wakes up , and lay down again , or anything ; and if he starts to get up , you holler and I 'll jump out over the other manger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 14]: Accordingly , Penrod established himself in a position to observe the recumbent figure .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 26]: Whitey 's breathing was rather laboured but regular , and , as Sam remarked , he looked `` better '' , even in his slumber .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 27]: It is not to be doubted that although Whitey was suffering from a light attack of colic his feelings were in the main those of contentment .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 25]: After trouble , he was solaced ; after exposure , he was sheltered ; after hunger and thirst , he was fed and watered .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 3]: He slept .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 42]: The noon whistles blew before Sam 's task was finished ; but by the time he departed for lunch there was made a bed of such quality that Whitey must needs have been a born fault-finder if he complained of it .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 28]: The friends parted , each urging the other to be prompt in returning ; but Penrod got into threatening difficulties as soon as he entered the house .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 30]: REWARD OF MERIT `` Penrod , '' said his mother , `` what did you do with that loaf of bread Della says you took from the table ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 3]: `` Ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 7]: WHAT loaf o ' bread ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 19]: `` I believe I ca n't let you go outdoors this afternoon , '' Mrs. Schofield said severely .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 40]: `` If you were hungry , you know perfectly well all you had to do was to -- '' `` But I was n't hungry ; I -- '' `` You can explain later , '' Mrs. Schofield said .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 8]: `` You 'll have all afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 6]: Penrod 's heart grew cold .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 11]: `` I CA N'T stay in , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 11]: `` I 've asked Sam Williams to come over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 8]: `` I 'll telephone Mrs. Williams . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 4]: `` Mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 6]: Penrod 's voice became agonized .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 16]: `` I HAD to give that bread to a -- to a poor ole man .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 12]: He was starving and so were his children and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 23]: They were all just STARVING -- and they could n't wait while I took time to come and ask you , Mamma .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 8]: I got to GO outdoors this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 4]: I GOT to !
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 7]: Sam 's -- '' She relented .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 17]: In the carriage-house , half an hour later , Penrod gave an account of the episode .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 29]: `` Where 'd we been , I 'd just like to know , '' he concluded , `` if I had n't got out here this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 16]: `` Well , I guess I could managed him all right , '' Sam said .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 18]: `` I was in the passageway , a minute ago , takin ' a look at him .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 7]: He 's standin ' up again .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 9]: I expect he wants more to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 14]: `` Well , we got to fix about that , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 33]: `` But what I mean -- if I 'd had to stay in the house , where would we been about the most important thing in the whole biz ` nuss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 8]: `` What you talkin ' about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 14]: `` Well , why ca n't you wait till I tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 7]: Penrod 's tone had become peevish .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 30]: For that matter , so had Sam 's ; they were developing one of the little differences , or quarrels , that composed the very texture of their friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 13]: `` Well , why do n't you tell me , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 8]: `` Well , how can I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 3]: Penrod demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 9]: `` You keep talkin ' every minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 12]: `` I 'm not talkin ' NOW , am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 3]: Sam protested .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 11]: `` You can tell me NOW , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 13]: I 'm not talk -- '' `` You are , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 3]: Penrod shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 7]: `` You talk all the time !
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 12]: You -- '' He was interrupted by Whitey 's peculiar cough .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 8]: Both boys jumped and forgot their argument .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 17]: `` He means he wants some more to eat , I bet , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 17]: `` Well , if he does , he 's got to wait , '' Penrod declared .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 16]: `` We got to get the most important thing of all fixed up first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 8]: `` What 's that , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 9]: `` The reward , '' said Penrod mildly .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 26]: `` That 's what I was tryin ' to tell you about , Sam , if you 'd ever give me half a chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 10]: `` Well , I DID give you a chance .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 16]: I kept TELLIN ' you to tell me , but -- '' `` You never !
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 35]: You kept sayin ' -- '' They renewed this discussion , protracting it indefinitely ; but as each persisted in clinging to his own interpretation of the facts , the question still remains unsettled .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 35]: It was abandoned , or rather , it merged into another during the later stages of the debate , this other being concerned with which of the debaters had the least `` sense . ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 25]: Each made the plain statement that if he were more deficient than his opponent in that regard , self-destruction would be his only refuge .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 48]: Each declared that he would `` rather die than be talked to death '' ; and then , as the two approached a point bluntly recriminative , Whitey coughed again , whereupon they were miraculously silent , and went into the passageway in a perfectly amiable manner .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 25]: `` I got to have a good look at him , for once , '' Penrod said , as he stared frowningly at Whitey .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 11]: `` We got to fix up about that reward . ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 17]: `` I want to take a good ole look at him myself , '' Sam said .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 19]: After supplying Whitey with another bucket of water , they returned to the carriage-house and seated themselves thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 28]: In truth , they were something a shade more than thoughtful ; the adventure to which they had committed themselves was beginning to be a little overpowering .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 44]: If Whitey had been a dog , a goat , a fowl , or even a stray calf , they would have felt equal to him ; but now that the earlier glow of their wild daring had disappeared , vague apprehensions stirred .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 20]: Their `` good look '' at Whitey had not reassured them -- he seemed large , Gothic and unusual .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 26]: Whisperings within them began to urge that for boys to undertake an enterprise connected with so huge an animal as an actual horse was perilous .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 50]: Beneath the surface of their musings , dim but ominous prophecies moved ; both boys began to have the feeling that , somehow , this affair was going to get beyond them and that they would be in heavy trouble before it was over -- they knew not why .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 53]: They knew why no more than they knew why they felt it imperative to keep the fact of Whitey 's presence in the stable a secret from their respective families ; but they did begin to realize that keeping a secret of that size was going to be attended with some difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 18]: In brief , their sensations were becoming comparable to those of the man who stole a house .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 20]: Nevertheless , after a short period given to unspoken misgivings , they returned to the subject of the reward .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 40]: The money-value of bay horses , as compared to white , was again discussed , and each announced his certainty that nothing less than `` a good ole hunderd dollars '' would be offered for the return of Whitey .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 16]: But immediately after so speaking they fell into another silence , due to sinking feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 22]: They had spoken loudly and confidently , and yet they knew , somehow , that such things were not to be .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 27]: According to their knowledge , it was perfectly reasonable to suppose that they would receive this fortune ; but they frightened themselves in speaking of it .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 14]: They knew that they COULD not have a hundred dollars for their own .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 16]: An oppression , as from something awful and criminal , descended upon them at intervals .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 26]: Presently , however , they were warmed to a little cheerfulness again by Penrod 's suggestion that they should put a notice in the paper .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 39]: Neither of them had the slightest idea how to get it there ; but such details as that were beyond the horizon ; they occupied themselves with the question of what their advertisement ought to `` say '' .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 24]: Finding that they differed irreconcilably , Penrod went to his cache in the sawdust-box and brought two pencils and a supply of paper .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 26]: He gave one of the pencils and several sheets to Sam ; then both boys bent themselves in silence to the labour of practical composition .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 6]: Penrod produced the briefer paragraph .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 4]: -LRB- See Fig .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 8]: I. -RRB- Sam 's was more ample .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 4]: -LRB- See Fig .

Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 25]: ---------------- Neither Sam nor Penrod showed any interest in what the other had written ; but both felt that something praiseworthy had been accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 38]: Penrod exhaled a sigh , as of relief , and , in a manner he had observed his father use sometimes , he said : `` Thank goodness , THAT 'S off my mind , anyway ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 11]: `` What we goin ' do next , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 13]: Sam asked deferentially , the borrowed manner having some effect upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 30]: `` I do n't know what YOU 'RE goin ' to do , '' Penrod returned , picking up the old cigarbox that had contained the paper and pencils .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 27]: `` I 'M goin ' to put mine in here , so 's it 'll come in handy when I haf to get at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 17]: `` Well , I guess I 'll keep mine there , too , '' Sam said .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 29]: Thereupon he deposited his scribbled slip beside Penrod 's in the cigarbox , and the box was solemnly returned to the secret place whence it had been taken .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 10]: `` There , THAT 'S ` tended to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 23]: Sam said , and , unconsciously imitating his friend 's imitation , he gave forth audibly a breath of satisfaction and relief .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 36]: Both boys felt that the financial side of their great affair had been conscientiously looked to , that the question of the reward was settled , and that everything was proceeding in a businesslike manner .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 13]: Therefore , they were able to turn their attention to another matter .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 10]: This was the question of Whitey 's next meal .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 44]: After their exploits of the morning , and the consequent imperilment of Penrod , they decided that nothing more was to be done in apples , vegetables or bread ; it was evident that Whitey must be fed from the bosom of nature .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 24]: `` We could n't pull enough o ' that frostbit ole grass in the yard to feed him , '' Penrod said gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 19]: `` We could work a week and not get enough to make him swaller more 'n about twice .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 13]: All we got this morning , he blew most of it away .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 51]: He 'd try to scoop it in toward his teeth with his lip , and then he 'd haf to kind of blow out his breath , and after that all the grass that 'd be left was just some wet pieces stickin ' to the outsides of his face .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 13]: Well , and you know how he acted about that maple branch .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 9]: We ca n't trust him with branches . ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 5]: Sam jumped up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 6]: _ I _ know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 11]: `` There 's lots of leaves left on the branches .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 8]: We can give them to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 18]: `` I just said -- '' `` I do n't mean the branches , '' Sam explained .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 35]: `` We 'll leave the branches on the trees , but just pull the leaves off the branches and put 'em in the bucket and feed 'em to him out of the bucket . ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 29]: Penrod thought this plan worth trying , and for three-quarters of an hour the two boys were busy with the lower branches of various trees in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 29]: Thus they managed to supply Whitey with a fair quantity of wet leaves , which he ate in a perfunctory way , displaying little of his earlier enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 36]: And the work of his purveyors might have been more tedious if it had been less damp , for a boy is seldom bored by anything that involves his staying-out in the rain without protection .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 26]: The drizzle had thickened ; the leaves were heavy with water , and at every jerk the branches sent fat drops over the two collectors .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 8]: They attained a noteworthy state of sogginess .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 21]: Finally , they were brought to the attention of the authorities indoors , and Della appeared upon the back porch .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 41]: `` Musther Penrod , '' she called , `` y' r mamma says ye 'll c 'm in the house this minute an ' change y' r shoes an ' stockin 's an ' everythun ' else ye got on !
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 5]: D'ye hear me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 23]: Penrod , taken by surprise and unpleasantly alarmed , darted away from the tree he was depleting and ran for the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 11]: `` You tell her I 'm dry as toast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 6]: he shouted over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 26]: Della withdrew , wearing the air of a person gratuitously insulted ; and a moment later she issued from the kitchen , carrying an umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 10]: She opened it and walked resolutely to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 28]: `` She says I 'm to bring ye in the house , '' said Della , `` an ' I 'm goin ' to bring ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 25]: Sam had joined Penrod in the carriage-house , and , with the beginnings of an unnamed terror , the two beheld this grim advance .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 9]: But they did not stay for its culmination .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 24]: Without a word to each other they hurriedly tiptoed up the stairs to the gloomy loft , and there they paused , listening .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 10]: They heard Della 's steps upon the carriage-house floor .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 25]: `` Ah , there 's plenty places t ` hide in , '' they heard her say ; `` but I 'll show ye !
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 33]: She tole me to bring ye , and I 'm -- '' She was interrupted by a peculiar sound -- loud , chilling , dismal , and unmistakably not of human origin .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 16]: The boys knew it for Whitey 's cough ; but Della had not their experience .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 34]: A smothered shriek reached their ears ; there was a scurrying noise , and then , with horror , they heard Della 's footsteps in the passageway that ran by Whitey 's manger .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 34]: Immediately there came a louder shriek , and even in the anguish of knowing their secret discovered , they were shocked to hear distinctly the words , `` O Lard in hivvin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 7]: in the well-known voice of Della .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 17]: She shrieked again , and they heard the rush of her footfalls across the carriage-house floor .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 15]: Wild words came from the outer air , and the kitchen door slammed violently .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 5]: It was all over .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 8]: She had gone to `` tell '' .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 13]: Penrod and Sam plunged down the stairs and out of the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 11]: They climbed the back fence and fled up the alley .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 36]: They turned into Sam 's yard , and , without consultation , headed for the cellar doors , nor paused till they found themselves in the farthest , darkest and gloomiest recess of the cellar .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 25]: There , perspiring , stricken with fear , they sank down upon the earthen floor , with their moist backs against the stone wall .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 4]: Thus with boys .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 23]: The vague apprehensions that had been creeping upon Penrod and Sam all afternoon had become monstrous ; the unknown was before them .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 43]: How great their crime would turn out to be -LRB- now that it was in the hands of grown people -RRB- they did not know ; but , since it concerned a horse , it would undoubtedly be considered of terrible dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 31]: Their plans for a reward , and all the things that had seemed both innocent and practical in the morning , now staggered their minds as manifestations of criminal folly .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 41]: A new and terrible light seemed to play upon the day 's exploits ; they had chased a horse belonging to strangers , and it would be said that they deliberately drove him into the stable and there concealed him .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 18]: They had , in truth , virtually stolen him , and they had stolen food for him .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 26]: The waning light through the small window above them warned Penrod that his inroads upon the vegetables in his own cellar must soon be discovered .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 23]: Della , that Nemesis , would seek them in order to prepare them for dinner , and she would find them not .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 33]: But she would recall his excursion to the cellar , for she had seen him when he came up ; and also the truth would be known concerning the loaf of bread .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 39]: Altogether , Penrod felt that his case was worse than Sam 's -- until Sam offered a suggestion that roused such horrible possibilities concerning the principal item of their offense that all thought of the smaller indictments disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 31]: `` Listen , Penrod , '' Sam quavered : `` What -- what if that -- what if that ole horse maybe b ` longed to a -- policeman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 10]: Sam 's imagination was not of the comforting kind .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 23]: `` What 'd they -- do to us , Penrod , if it turned out he was some policeman 's horse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 9]: Penrod was able only to shake his head .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 51]: He did not reply in words ; but both boys thenceforth considered it almost inevitable that Whitey had belonged to a policeman , and , in their sense of so ultimate a disaster , they ceased for a time to brood upon what their parents would probably do to them .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 21]: The penalty for stealing a policeman 's horse would be only a step short of capital , they were sure .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 22]: They would not be hanged ; but vague , looming sketches of something called the penitentiary began to flicker before them .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 17]: It grew darker in the cellar , so that finally they could not see each other .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 17]: `` I guess they 're huntin ' for us by now , '' Sam said huskily .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 17]: `` I do n't -- I do n't like it much down here , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 20]: Penrod 's hoarse whisper came from the profound gloom : `` Well , who ever said you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 25]: `` Well -- '' Sam paused ; then he said plaintively , `` I wish we 'd never SEEN that dern ole horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 12]: `` It was every bit his fault , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 7]: `` We did n't do anything .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 21]: If he had n't come stickin ' his ole head in our stable , it 'd never happened at all .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 4]: Ole fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 3]: He rose .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 23]: `` I 'm goin ' to get out of here ; I guess I 've stood about enough for one day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 10]: `` Where -- where you goin ' , Penrod ?
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 11]: You are n't goin ' HOME , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 7]: `` No ; I 'm not !
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 6]: What you take me for ?
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 7]: You think I 'm crazy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 9]: `` Well , where CAN we go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 59]: How far Penrod 's desperation actually would have led him is doubtful ; but he made this statement : `` I do n't know where YOU 'RE goin ' , but I 'M goin ' to walk straight out in the country till I come to a farmhouse and say my name 's George and live there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 13]: `` I 'll do it , too , '' Sam whispered eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 10]: `` I 'll say my name 's Henry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 14]: `` Well , we better get started , '' said the executive Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 12]: `` We got to get away from here , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 30]: But when they came to ascend the steps leading to the `` outside doors '' , they found that those doors had been closed and locked for the night .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 26]: `` It 's no use , '' Sam lamented , `` and we ca n't bust 'em , cause I tried to , once before .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 11]: Fanny always locks 'em about five o'clock -- I forgot .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 17]: We got to go up the stairway and try to sneak out through the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 10]: They tiptoed back , and up the inner stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 18]: They paused at the top , then breathlessly stepped out into a hall that was entirely dark .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 15]: Sam touched Penrod 's sleeve in warning and bent to listen at a door .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 20]: Immediately that door opened , revealing the bright library , where sat Penrod 's mother and Sam 's father .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 11]: It was Sam 's mother who had opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 12]: `` Come into the library , boys , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 11]: `` Mrs. Schofield is just telling us about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 32]: And as the two comrades moved dumbly into the lighted room , Penrod 's mother rose , and , taking him by the shoulder , urged him close to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 29]: `` You stand there and try to dry off a little , while I finish telling Mr. and Mrs. Williams about you and Sam , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 23]: `` You 'd better make Sam keep near the fire , too , Mrs. Williams , because they both got wringing wet .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 15]: Think of their running off just when most people would have wanted to stay !
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 12]: Well , I 'll go on with the story , then .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 71]: Della told me all about it , and what the cook next door said SHE 'D seen , how they 'd been trying to pull grass and leaves for the poor old thing all day -- and all about the apples they carried from YOUR cellar , and getting wet and working in the rain as hard as they could -- and they 'd given him a loaf of bread !
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 7]: Shame on you , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 20]: She paused to laugh ; but there was a little moisture about her eyes , even before she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 19]: `` And they 'd fed him on potatoes and lettuce and cabbage and turnips out of OUR cellar !
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 14]: And I wish you 'd see the sawdust bed they made for him !
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 27]: Well , when I 'd telephoned , and the Humane Society man got there , he said it was the most touching thing he ever knew .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 14]: It seems he KNEW this horse , and had been looking for him .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 50]: He said ninety-nine boys out of a hundred would have chased the poor old thing away , and he was going to see to it that this case did n't go unnoticed , because the local branch of the society gives little silver medals for special acts like this .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 30]: And the last thing he said was that he was sure Penrod and Sam each would be awarded one at the meeting of the society next Thursday night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 35]: ... On the following Saturday a yodel sounded from the sunny sidewalk in front of the Schofields ' house , and Penrod , issuing forth , beheld the familiar figure of Samuel Williams waiting .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 24]: Upon Sam 's breast there glittered a round bit of silver suspended by a white ribbon from a bar of the same metal .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 12]: Upon the breast of Penrod was a decoration precisely similar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 9]: ` Lo , Penrod , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 10]: `` What are you goin ' to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 14]: `` Nothin ' '' `` I got mine on , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 10]: `` I have , too , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 12]: `` I would n't take a hunderd dollars for mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 14]: `` I would n't take two hunderd for mine , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 9]: Each glanced pleasantly at the other 's medal .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 7]: They faced each other without shame .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 14]: Neither had the slightest sense of hypocrisy in himself or in his comrade .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 4]: On the contrary !
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 39]: Penrod 's eyes went from Sam 's medal back to his own ; thence they wandered , with perhaps a little disappointment , to the lifeless street and to the empty yards and spectatorless windows of the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 16]: Then he looked southward toward the busy heart of the town , where multitudes were .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 19]: `` Let 's go down and see what time it is by the court-house-clock , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 34]: CHAPTER X. CONSCIENCE Mrs. Schofield had been away for three days , visiting her sister in Dayton , Illinois , and on the train , coming back , she fell into a reverie .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 29]: Little dramas of memory were reenacted in her pensive mind , and through all of them moved the figure of Penrod as a principal figure , or star .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 29]: These little dramas did not present Penrod as he really was , much less did they glow with the uncertain but glamorous light in which Penrod saw himself .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 51]: No ; Mrs. Schofield had indulged herself in absence from her family merely for her own pleasure , and , now that she was homeward bound , her conscience was asserting itself ; the fact that she had enjoyed her visit began to take on the aspect of a crime .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 40]: She had heard from her family only once during the three days -- the message `` All well do n't worry enjoy yourself '' telegraphed by Mr. Schofield , and she had followed his suggestions to a reasonable extent .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 29]: Of course she had worried -- but only at times ; wherefore she now suffered more and more poignant pangs of shame because she had not worried constantly .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 18]: Naturally , the figure of Penrod , in her railway reverie , was that of an invalid .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 15]: She recalled all the illnesses of his babyhood and all those of his boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 22]: She reconstructed scene after scene , with the hero always prostrate and the family physician opening the black case of phials .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 40]: She emphatically renewed her recollection of accidental misfortunes to the body of Penrod Schofield , omitting neither the considerable nor the inconsiderable , forgetting no strain , sprain , cut , bruise or dislocation of which she had knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 38]: And running this film in a sequence unrelieved by brighter interludes , she produced a biographical picture of such consistent and unremittent gloom that Penrod 's past appeared to justify disturbing thoughts about his present and future .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 62]: She became less and less at ease , reproaching herself for having gone away , wondering how she had brought herself to do such a crazy thing , for it seemed to her that the members of her family were almost helpless without her guidance ; they were apt to do anything -- anything at all -- or to catch anything .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 29]: The more she thought about her having left these irresponsible harebrains unprotected and undirected for three days , the less she was able to account for her action .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 30]: It seemed to her that she must have been a little flighty ; but , shaking her head grimly , she decided that flightiness was not a good excuse .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 79]: And she made up her mind that if , upon her arrival , she found poor little neglected Penrod -LRB- and Margaret and Mr. Schofield -RRB- spared to her , safe and sound , she would make up to them -- especially to Penrod -- for all her lack of care in the past , and for this present wild folly of spending three whole days and nights with her sister , far away in Dayton , Illinois .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 29]: Consequently , when Mrs. Schofield descended from that train , she wore the hurried but determined expression that was always the effect upon her of a guilty conscience .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 10]: `` You 're SURE Penrod is well now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 27]: she repeated , after Mr. Schofield had seated himself at her side in a vehicle known to its driver as a `` deepoe hack '' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 6]: ` Well NOW ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 9]: `` He 's been well all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 12]: I 've told you twice that he 's all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 8]: `` Men ca n't always see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 6]: She shook her head impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 13]: `` I have n't been a bit sure he was well lately .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 15]: I do n't think he 's been really well for two or three months .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 7]: How has he seemed to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 11]: `` In fair health , '' Mr. Schofield replied thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 40]: `` Della called me up at the office to tell me that one of the telephone-men had come into the house to say that if that durn boy did n't quit climbing their poles they 'd have him arrested .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 11]: They said he -- '' `` That 's it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 5]: Mrs. Schofield interrupted quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 5]: `` He 's nervous .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 11]: It 's some nervous trouble makes him act like that .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 9]: He 's not like himself at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 16]: `` Sometimes , '' Mr. Schofield said , `` I wish he were n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 33]: `` When he 's himself , '' Mrs. Schofield went on anxiously , `` he 's very quiet and good ; he does n't go climbing telegraph-poles and reckless things like that .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 30]: And I noticed before I went away that he was growing twitchy , and seemed to be getting the habit of making unpleasant little noises in his throat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 12]: `` Do n't fret about that , '' her husband said .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 16]: `` He was trying to learn Sam Williams 's imitation of a bullfrog 's croak .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 12]: I used to do that myself when I was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 4]: Gl-glump , gallump !
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 9]: No ; I ca n't do it now .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 11]: But nearly all boys feel obliged to learn it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 15]: `` You 're entirely mistaken , Henry , '' she returned a little sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 12]: `` That is n't the way he goes in his throat .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 21]: Penrod is getting to be a VERY nervous boy , and he makes noises because he ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 26]: He works part of his face , too , sometimes , so much that I 've been afraid it would interfere with his looks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 7]: `` Interfere with his what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 11]: For the moment , Mr. Schofield seemed to be dazed .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 20]: `` When he 's himself , '' she returned crisply , `` he 's quite a handsome boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 5]: `` He is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 14]: `` Handsomer than the average , anyhow , '' Mrs. Schofield said firmly .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 23]: `` No wonder you do n't see it -- when we 've let his system get all run down like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 5]: `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 6]: the mystified Mr. Schofield murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 20]: `` Penrod 's system has n't been running down ; it 's just the same as it always was .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 7]: He 's absolutely all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 7]: `` Indeed he is not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 4]: she said severely .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 16]: `` We 've got to take better care of him than we have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 20]: `` Why , how could -- '' `` I know what I 'm talking about , '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 16]: `` Penrod is anything but a strong boy , and it 's all our fault .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 25]: We have n't been watchful enough of his health ; that 's what 's the matter with him and makes him so nervous . ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 24]: Thus she continued , and , as she talked on , Mr. Schofield began , by imperceptible processes , to adopt her views .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 14]: As for Mrs. Schofield herself , these views became substantial by becoming vocal .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 27]: This is to say , with all deference , that as soon as she heard herself stating them she was convinced that they accurately represented facts .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 31]: And the determined look in her eyes deepened when the `` deepoe hack '' turned the familiar corner and she saw Penrod running to the gate , followed by Duke .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 11]: Never had Penrod been so glad to greet his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 14]: Never was he more boisterous in the expression of happiness of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 16]: And the tokens of his appetite at dinner , a little later , were extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 18]: Mr. Schofield began to feel reassured in spite of himself ; but Mrs. Schofield shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 6]: `` Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 5]: It 's abnormal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 10]: she said , in a low , decisive voice .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 19]: That night Penrod awoke from a sweet , conscienceless slumber -- or , rather , he was awakened .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 10]: A wrappered form lurked over him in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 23]: `` Uff -- ow -- '' he muttered , and turned his face from the dim light that shone through the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 10]: He sighed and sought the depths of sleep again .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 24]: `` Penrod , '' his mother said softly , and , while he resisted feebly , she turned him over to face her .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 12]: `` Gawn lea ' me ` lone , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 18]: Then , as a little sphere touched his lips , he jerked his head away , startled .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 4]: `` Whassat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 21]: Mrs. Schofield replied in tones honeysweet and coaxing : `` It 's just a nice little pill , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 7]: `` Doe waw ` ny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 19]: he protested , keeping his eyes shut , clinging to the sleep from which he was being riven .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 12]: `` Be a good boy , Penrod , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 15]: `` Here 's a glass of nice cool water to swallow it down with .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 15]: Come , dear ; it 's going to do you lots of good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 29]: And again the little pill was placed suggestively against his lips ; but his head jerked backward , and his hand struck out in blind , instinctive self-defense .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 17]: `` I 'll BUST that ole pill , '' he muttered , still with closed eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 15]: `` Lem me get my han 's on it an ' I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 4]: `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 9]: `` PLEASE go on away , mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 15]: `` I will , just as soon as you take this little pill . ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 5]: `` I DID ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 6]: `` No , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 9]: `` I did , '' Penrod insisted plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 14]: `` You made me take it just before I went to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes ; THAT one .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 32]: But , dearie , '' Mrs. Schofield explained , `` I got to thinking about it after I went to bed , and I decided you 'd better have another . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 8]: `` I do n't WANT another . ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 6]: `` Yes , dearie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 11]: `` Please go ` way and let me sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 13]: `` Not till you 've taken the little pill , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 6]: `` Oh , GOLLY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 18]: Groaning , he propped himself upon an elbow and allowed the pill to pass between his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 22]: -LRB- He would have allowed anything whatever to pass between them , if that passing permitted his return to slumber . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 22]: Then , detaining the pill in his mouth , he swallowed half a glass of water , and again was recumbent .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 9]: `` G ' - night , Mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 5]: `` Good-night , dearie .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 4]: Sleep well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 21]: After her departure Penrod drowsily enjoyed the sugar coating of the pill ; but this was indeed a brief pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 42]: A bitterness that was like a pang suddenly made itself known to his sense of taste , and he realized that he had dallied too confidingly with the product of a manufacturing chemist who should have been indicted for criminal economy .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 31]: The medicinal portion of the little pill struck the wall with a faint tap , then dropped noiselessly to the floor , and , after a time , Penrod slept .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 31]: Some hours later he began to dream ; he dreamed that his feet and legs were becoming uncomfortable as a result of Sam Williams 's activities with a red-hot poker .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 6]: `` You QUIT that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 8]: he said aloud , and awoke indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 11]: Again a dark , wrappered figure hovered over the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 25]: `` It 's only a hot-water bag , dear , '' Mrs. Schofield said , still labouring under the covers with an extended arm .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 12]: `` You must n't hunch yourself up that way , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 8]: Put your feet down on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 20]: And , as he continued to hunch himself , she moved the bag in the direction of his withdrawal .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 6]: `` Ow , murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 4]: he exclaimed convulsively .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 8]: `` What you tryin ' to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 6]: Scald me to death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 25]: `` Penrod -- '' `` My goodness , Mamma , '' he wailed ; `` ca n't you let me sleep a MINUTE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 17]: `` It 's very bad for you to let your feet get cold , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 6]: `` They WERE N'T cold .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 27]: I do n't want any ole hot-wat -- '' `` Penrod , '' she said firmly , `` you must put your feet against the bag .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 7]: It is n't too hot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 8]: `` Oh , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 3]: he retorted .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 18]: `` I do n't s ` pose you 'd care if I burned my feet right off !
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 15]: Mamma , wo n't you please , pul-LEEZE let me get some sleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 20]: `` Not till you -- '' She was interrupted by a groan that seemed to come from an abyss .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 9]: `` All right , I 'll do it !
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 7]: Let 'em burn , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 26]: Thus spake the desperate Penrod ; and Mrs. Schofield was able to ascertain that one heel had been placed in light contact with the bag .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 9]: `` No ; both feet , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 7]: With a tragic shiver he obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 7]: `` THAT 'S right , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 7]: Now , keep them that way .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 6]: It 's good for you .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 3]: Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 7]: `` G ' - night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 28]: The door closed softly behind her , and the body of Penrod , from the hips upward , rose invisibly in the complete darkness of the bedchamber .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 36]: A moment later the hot-water bag reached the floor in as noiseless a manner as that previously adopted by the remains of the little pill , and Penrod once more bespread his soul with poppies .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 9]: This time he slept until the breakfast-bell rang .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 14]: He was late to school , and at once found himself in difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 17]: Government demanded an explanation of the tardiness ; but Penrod made no reply of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 37]: Taciturnity is seldom more strikingly out of place than under such circumstances , and the penalties imposed took account not only of Penrod 's tardiness but of his supposititious defiance of authority in declining to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 44]: The truth was that Penrod did not know why he was tardy , and , with mind still lethargic , found it impossible to think of an excuse his continuing silence being due merely to the persistence of his efforts to invent one .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 21]: Thus were his meek searchings misinterpreted , and the unloved hours of improvement in science and the arts made odious .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 6]: `` They 'll SEE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 18]: he whispered sorely to himself , as he bent low over his desk , a little later .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 9]: Some day he would `` show 'em '' .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 63]: The picture in his mind was of a vast , vague assembly of people headed by Miss Spence and the superior pupils who were never tardy , and these multitudes , representing persecution and government in general , were all cringing before a Penrod Schofield who rode a grim black horse up and down their miserable ranks , and gave curt orders .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 8]: `` Make 'em step back there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 6]: he commanded his myrmidons savagely .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 22]: `` Fix it so 's your horses 'll step on their feet if they do n't do what I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 14]: Then , from his shining saddle , he watched the throngs slinking away .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 11]: `` I guess they know who I am NOW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 47]: THE TONIC These broodings helped a little ; but it was a severe morning , and on his way home at noon he did not recover heart enough to practice the bullfrog 's croak , the craft that Sam Williams had lately mastered to inspiring perfection .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 11]: This sonorous accomplishment Penrod had determined to make his own .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 29]: At once guttural and resonant , impudent yet plaintive , with a barbaric twang like the plucked string of a Congo war-fiddle , the sound had fascinated him .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 37]: It is made in the throat by processes utterly impossible to describe in human words , and no alphabet as yet produced by civilized man affords the symbols to vocalize it to the ear of imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 15]: `` Gunk '' is the poor makeshift that must be employed to indicate it .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 16]: Penrod uttered one half-hearted `` Gunk '' as he turned in at his own gate .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 12]: However , this stimulated him , and he paused to practice .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 4]: `` Gunk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 3]: he croaked .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 4]: `` Gunk-gunk-gunk-gunk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 10]: Mrs. Schofield leaned out of an open window upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 13]: `` Do n't do that , Penrod , '' she said anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 8]: `` Please do n't do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 23]: Penrod asked , and , feeling encouraged by his progress in the new art , he continued : `` Gunk -- gunk-gunk !
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 16]: Gunk-gunk -- '' `` Please try not to do it , '' she urged pleadingly .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 9]: `` You CAN stop it if you try .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 7]: Wo n't you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 20]: But Penrod felt that he was almost upon the point of attaining a mastery equal to Sam Williams 's .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 39]: He had just managed to do something in his throat that he had never done before , and he felt that unless he kept on doing it at this time , his new-born facility might evade him later .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 4]: `` Gunk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 3]: he croaked .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 6]: `` Gunk -- gunk-gunk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 18]: And he continued to croak , persevering monotonously , his expression indicating the depth of his preoccupation .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 35]: His mother looked down solicitously , murmured in a melancholy undertone , shook her head ; then disappeared from the window , and , after a moment or two , opened the front door .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 19]: `` Come in , dear , '' she said ; `` I 've got something for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 14]: Penrod 's look of preoccupation vanished ; he brightened and ceased to croak .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 23]: His mother had already given him a small leather pocketbook with a nickel in it , as a souvenir of her journey .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 15]: Evidently she had brought another gift as well , delaying its presentation until now .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 9]: `` I 've got something for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 5]: These were auspicious words .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 8]: `` What is it , Mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 16]: he asked , and , as she smiled tenderly upon him , his gayety increased .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 4]: `` Yay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 19]: `` Mamma , is it that reg ` lar carpenter 's tool chest I told you about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 7]: `` No , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 9]: `` But I 'll show you , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 6]: Come on , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 53]: He followed her with alacrity to the dining-room , and the bright anticipation in his eyes grew more brilliant -- until she opened the door of the china-closet , simultaneously with that action announcing cheerily : `` It 's something that 's going to do you lots of good , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 25]: He was instantly chilled , for experience had taught him that when predictions of this character were made , nothing pleasant need be expected .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 39]: Two seconds later his last hope departed as she turned from the closet and he beheld in her hands a quart bottle containing what appeared to be a section of grassy swamp immersed in a cloudy brown liquor .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 10]: He stepped back , grave suspicion in his glance .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 6]: `` What IS that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 8]: he asked , in a hard voice .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 6]: Mrs. Schofield smiled upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 9]: `` It 's nothing , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 13]: `` That is , it 's nothing you 'll mind at all .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 12]: It 's just so you wo n't be so nervous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 7]: `` I 'm not nervous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 33]: `` You do n't think so , of course , dear , '' she returned , and , as she spoke , she poured some of the brown liquor into a tablespoon .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 38]: `` People often ca n't tell when they 're nervous themselves ; but your Papa and I have been getting a little anxious about you , dear , and so I got this medicine for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 8]: `` WHERE 'D you get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 17]: Mrs. Schofield set the bottle down and moved toward him , insinuatingly extending the full tablespoon .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 40]: `` Here , dear , '' she said ; `` just take this little spoonful , like a goo -- '' `` I want to know where it came from , '' he insisted darkly , again stepping backward .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 22]: she echoed absently , watching to see that nothing was spilled from the spoon as she continued to move toward him .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 45]: `` Why , I was talking to old Mrs. Wottaw at market this morning , and she said her son Clark used to have nervous trouble , and she told me about this medicine and how to have it made at the drug store .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 38]: She told me it cured Clark , and -- '' `` I do n't want to be cured , '' Penrod said , adding inconsistently , `` I have n't got anything to be cured of . ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 43]: `` Now , dear , '' Mrs. Schofield began , `` you do n't want your papa and me to keep on worrying about -- '' `` I do n't care whether you worry or not , '' the heartless boy interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 12]: `` I do n't want to take any horrable ole medicine .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 12]: What 's that grass and weeds in the bottle for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 5]: Mrs. Schofield looked grieved .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 19]: `` There is n't any grass and there are n't any weeds ; those are healthful herbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 10]: `` I bet they 'll make me sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 3]: She sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 12]: `` Penrod , we 're trying to make you well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 11]: `` But I AM well , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 15]: `` No , dear ; your papa 's been very much troubled about you .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 17]: Come , Penrod ; swallow this down and do n't make such a fuss about it .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 9]: It 's just for your own good . ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 14]: And she advanced upon him again , the spoon extended toward his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 17]: It almost touched them , for he had retreated until his back was against the wall-paper .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 17]: He could go no farther ; but he evinced his unshaken repugnance by averting his face .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 8]: `` What 's it taste like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 19]: `` It 's not unpleasant at all , '' she answered , poking the spoon at his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 13]: `` Mrs. Wottaw said Clark used to be very fond of it .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 15]: It does n't taste like ordinary medicine at all , ' she said . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 10]: `` How often I got to take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 13]: Penrod mumbled , as the persistent spoon sought to enter his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 6]: `` Just this once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 11]: `` No , dear ; three times a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 8]: `` I wo n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 4]: `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 4]: She spoke sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 12]: `` You swallow this down and stop making such a fuss .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 7]: I ca n't be all day .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 3]: Hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 22]: She inserted the spoon between his lips , so that its rim touched his clenched teeth ; he was still reluctant .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 39]: Moreover , is reluctance was natural and characteristic , for a boy 's sense of taste is as simple and as peculiar as a dog 's , though , of course , altogether different from a dog 's .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 25]: A boy , passing through the experimental age , may eat and drink astonishing things ; but they must be of his own choosing .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 25]: His palate is tender , and , in one sense , might be called fastidious ; nothing is more sensitive or more easily shocked .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 28]: A boy tastes things much more than grown people taste them : what is merely unpleasant to a man is sheer broth of hell to a boy .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 15]: Therefore , not knowing what might be encountered , Penrod continued to be reluctant .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 32]: `` Penrod , '' his mother exclaimed , losing patience , `` I 'll call your papa to make you take it , if you do n't swallow it right down !
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 6]: Open your mouth , Penrod !
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 10]: It is n't going to taste bad at all .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 7]: Open your mouth -- THERE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 28]: The reluctant jaw relaxed at last , and Mrs. Schofield dexterously elevated the handle of the spoon so that the brown liquor was deposited within her son .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 4]: she repeated triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 13]: `` It was n't so bad after all , was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 5]: Penrod did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 20]: His expression had become odd , and the oddity of his manner was equal to that of his expression .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 22]: Uttering no sound , he seemed to distend , as if he had suddenly become a pneumatic boy under dangerous pressure .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 15]: Meanwhile , his reddening eyes , fixed awfully upon his mother , grew unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 18]: `` Now , it was n't such a bad taste , '' Mrs. Schofield said rather nervously .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 11]: `` Do n't go acting THAT way , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 7]: But Penrod could not help himself .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 33]: In truth , even a grown person hardened to all manner of flavours , and able to eat caviar or liquid Camembert , would have found the cloudy brown liquor virulently repulsive .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 39]: It contained in solution , with other things , the vital element of surprise , for it was comparatively odourless , and , unlike the chivalrous rattlesnake , gave no warning of what it was about to do .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 16]: In the case of Penrod , the surprise was complete and its effect visibly shocking .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 24]: The distention by which he began to express his emotion appeared to be increasing ; his slender throat swelled as his cheeks puffed .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 24]: His shoulders rose toward his ears ; he lifted his right leg in an unnatural way and held it rigidly in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 7]: `` Stop that , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 4]: Mrs. Schofield commanded .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 6]: `` You stop it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 5]: He found his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 3]: `` Uff !
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 3]: OOOFF ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 22]: he said thickly , and collapsed -- a mere , ordinary , every-day convulsion taking the place of his pneumatic symptoms .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 27]: He began to writhe , at the same time opening and closing his mouth rapidly and repeatedly , waving his arms , stamping on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 3]: `` Ow !
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 3]: Ow-ow-OW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 3]: he vociferated .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 22]: Reassured by these normal demonstrations , of a type with which she was familiar , Mrs. Schofield resumed her fond smile .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 10]: `` YOU 'RE all right , little boysie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 4]: she said heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 25]: Then , picking up the bottle , she replenished the tablespoon , and told Penrod something she had considered it undiplomatic to mention before .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 12]: `` Here 's the other one , '' she said sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 4]: `` Uuf ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 3]: he sputtered .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 8]: `` Other -- uh -- what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 12]: `` Two tablespoons before each meal , '' she informed him .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 16]: Instantly Penrod made the first of a series of passionate efforts to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 76]: His determination was so intense and the manifestations of it were so ruthless , that Mrs. Schofield , exhausted , found herself obliged to call for the official head of the house -- in fact , she found herself obliged to shriek for him ; and Mr. Schofield , hastily entering the room , beheld his wife apparently in the act of sawing his son back and forth across the sill of an open window .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 29]: Penrod made a frantic effort to reach the good green earth , even after his mother 's clutch upon his ankle had been reenforced by his father 's .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 19]: Nor was the lad 's revolt subdued when he was deposited upon the floor and the window closed .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 28]: Indeed , it may be said that he actually never gave up , though it is a fact that the second potion was successfully placed inside him .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 53]: But by the time this feat was finally accomplished , Mr. Schofield had proved that , in spite of middle age , he was entitled to substantial claims and honours both as athlete and orator -- his oratory being founded less upon the school of Webster and more upon that of Jeremiah .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 18]: So the thing was done , and the double dose put within the person of Penrod Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 32]: It proved not ineffective there , and presently , as its new owner sat morosely at table , he began to feel slightly dizzy and his eyes refused him perfect service .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 26]: This was natural , because two tablespoons of the cloudy brown liquor contained about the amount of alcohol to be found in an ordinary cocktail .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 22]: Now a boy does not enjoy the effects of intoxication ; enjoyment of that kind is obtained only by studious application .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 24]: Therefore , Penrod spoke of his symptoms complainingly , and even showed himself so vindictive as to attribute them to the new medicine .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 6]: His mother made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 16]: Instead , she nodded her head as if some inner conviction had proven well founded .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 12]: `` BILIOUS , TOO , '' she whispered to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 47]: That evening , during the half-hour preceding dinner , the dining-room was the scene of another struggle , only a little less desperate than that which had been the prelude to lunch , and again an appeal to the head of the house was found necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 34]: Muscular activity and a liberal imitation of the jeremiads once more subjugated the rebel -- and the same rebellion and its suppression in a like manner took place the following morning before breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 21]: But this was Saturday , and , without warning or apparent reason , a remarkable change came about at noon .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 20]: However , Mr. and Mrs. Schofield were used to inexplicable changes in Penrod , and they missed its significance .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 35]: When Mrs. Schofield , with dread in her heart , called Penrod into the house `` to take his medicine '' before lunch , he came briskly , and took it like a lamb !
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 10]: `` Why , Penrod , that 's splendid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 14]: she cried `` You see it is n't bad , at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 9]: `` No 'm , '' he said meekly .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 10]: `` Not when you get used to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 13]: `` And are n't you ashamed , making all that fuss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 5]: she went on happily .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 9]: `` Yes 'm , I guess so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 8]: `` And do n't you feel better ?
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 14]: Do n't you see how much good it 's doing you already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 9]: `` Yes 'm , I guess so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 51]: Upon a holiday morning , several weeks later , Penrod and Sam Williams revived a pastime that they called `` drug store '' , setting up display counters , selling chemical , cosmetic and other compounds to imaginary customers , filling prescriptions and variously conducting themselves in a pharmaceutical manner .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 21]: They were in the midst of affairs when Penrod interrupted his partner and himself with a cry of recollection . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 6]: _ I _ know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 11]: `` I got some mighty good ole stuff we want .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 4]: You wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 10]: And , dashing to the house , he disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 19]: Returning immediately , Penrod placed upon the principal counter of the `` drug store '' a large bottle .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 28]: It was a quart bottle , in fact ; and it contained what appeared to be a section of grassy swamp immersed in a cloudy brown liquor .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 3]: Penrod exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 11]: `` How 's that for some good ole medicine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 12]: `` It 's good ole stuff , '' Sam said approvingly .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 7]: `` Where 'd you get it ?
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 7]: Whose is it , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 9]: `` It WAS mine , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 11]: `` Up to about serreval days ago , it was .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 8]: They quit givin ' it to me .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 13]: I had to take two bottles and a half of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 11]: `` What did you haf to take it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 12]: `` I got nervous , or sumpthing , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 8]: `` You all well again now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 5]: `` I guess so .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 24]: Uncle Passloe and cousin Ronald came to visit , and I expect she got too busy to think about it , or sumpthing .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 17]: Anyway , she quit makin ' me take it , and said I was lots better .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 11]: She 's forgot all about it by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 10]: Sam was looking at the bottle with great interest .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 12]: `` What 's all that stuff in there , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 13]: `` What 's all that stuff in there looks like grass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 9]: `` It IS grass , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 8]: `` How 'd it get there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 13]: `` I stuck it in there , '' the candid boy replied .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 15]: `` First they had some horrable ole stuff in there like to killed me .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 52]: But after they got three doses down me , I took the bottle out in the yard and cleaned her all out and pulled a lot o ' good ole grass and stuffed her pretty full and poured in a lot o ' good ole hydrant water on top of it .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 30]: Then , when they got the next bottle , I did the same way , and -- '' `` It do n't look like water , '' Sam objected .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 6]: Penrod laughed a superior laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 22]: `` Oh , that 's nothin ' , '' he said , with the slight swagger of young and conscious genius .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 23]: `` Of course , I had to slip in and shake her up sometimes , so 's they would n't notice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 16]: `` But what did you put in it to make it look like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 15]: Penrod , upon the point of replying , happened to glance toward the house .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 13]: His gaze , lifting , rested for a moment upon a window .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 11]: The head of Mrs. Schofield was framed in that window .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 7]: She nodded gayly to her son .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 24]: She could see him plainly , and she thought that he seemed perfectly healthy , and as happy as a boy could be .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 4]: She was right .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 9]: `` What DID you put in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 3]: Sam insisted .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 28]: And probably it was just as well that , though Mrs. Schofield could see her son , the distance was too great for her to hear him .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 10]: `` Oh , nothin ' , '' Penrod replied .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 11]: `` Nothin ' but a little good ole mud . ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 33]: GIPSY On a fair Saturday afternoon in November Penrod 's little old dog Duke returned to the ways of his youth and had trouble with a strange cat on the back porch .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 40]: This indiscretion , so uncharacteristic , was due to the agitation of a surprised moment , for Duke 's experience had inclined him to a peaceful pessimism , and he had no ambition for hazardous undertakings of any sort .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 28]: He was given to musing but not to avoidable action , and he seemed habitually to hope for something that he was pretty sure would not happen .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 13]: Even in his sleep , this gave him an air of wistfulness .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 63]: Thus , being asleep in a nook behind the metal refuse-can , when the strange cat ventured to ascend the steps of the porch , his appearance was so unwarlike that the cat felt encouraged to extend its field of reconnaissance for the cook had been careless , and the backbone of a three-pound whitefish lay at the foot of the refuse-can .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 17]: This cat was , for a cat , needlessly tall , powerful , independent and masculine .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 34]: Once , long ago , he had been a roly-poly pepper-and-salt kitten ; he had a home in those days , and a name , `` Gipsy , '' which he abundantly justified .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 6]: He was precocious in dissipation .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 19]: Long before his adolescence , his lack of domesticity was ominous , and he had formed bad companionships .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 75]: Meanwhile , he grew so rangy , and developed such length and power of leg and such traits of character , that the father of the little girl who owned him was almost convincing when he declared that the young cat was half broncho and half Malay pirate -- though , in the light of Gipsy 's later career , this seems bitterly unfair to even the lowest orders of bronchos and Malay pirates .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 12]: No ; Gipsy was not the pet for a little girl .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 12]: The rosy hearthstone and sheltered rug were too circumspect for him .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 33]: Surrounded by the comforts of middle-class respectability , and profoundly oppressed , even in his youth , by the Puritan ideals of the household , he sometimes experienced a sense of suffocation .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 21]: He wanted free air and he wanted free life ; he wanted the lights , the lights and the music .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 6]: He abandoned the bourgeoise irrevocably .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 20]: He went forth in a May twilight , carrying the evening beefsteak with him , and joined the underworld .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 38]: His extraordinary size , his daring and his utter lack of sympathy soon made him the leader -- and , at the same time , the terror -- of all the loose-lived cats in a wide neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 9]: He contracted no friendships and had no confidants .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 25]: He seldom slept in the same place twice in succession , and though he was wanted by the police , he was not found .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 34]: In appearance he did not lack distinction of an ominous sort ; the slow , rhythmic , perfectly controlled mechanism of his tail , as he impressively walked abroad , was incomparably sinister .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 44]: This stately and dangerous walk of his , his long , vibrant whiskers , his scars , his yellow eye , so ice-cold , so fire-hot , haughty as the eye of Satan , gave him the deadly air of a mousquetaire duellist .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 40]: His soul was in that walk and in that eye ; it could be read -- the soul of a bravo of fortune , living on his wits and his velour , asking no favours and granting no quarter .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 65]: Intolerant , proud , sullen , yet watchful and constantly planning -- purely a militarist , believing in slaughter as in a religion , and confident that art , science , poetry and the good of the world were happily advanced thereby -- Gipsy had become , though technically not a wildcat , undoubtedly the most untamed cat at large in the civilized world .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 36]: Such , in brief , was the terrifying creature that now elongated its neck , and , over the top step of the porch , bent a calculating scrutiny upon the wistful and slumberous Duke .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 8]: The scrutiny was searching but not prolonged .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 20]: Gipsy muttered contemptuously to himself , `` Oh , sheol ; I 'm not afraid o ' THAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 16]: And he approached the fishbone , his padded feet making no noise upon the boards .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 22]: It was a desirable fishbone , large , with a considerable portion of the fish 's tail still attached to it .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 25]: It was about a foot from Duke 's nose , and the little dog 's dreams began to be troubled by his olfactory nerve .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 32]: This faithful sentinel , on guard even while Duke slept , signalled that alarums and excursions by parties unknown were taking place , and suggested that attention might well be paid .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 6]: Duke opened one drowsy eye .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 7]: What that eye beheld was monstrous .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 17]: Here was a strange experience -- the horrific vision in the midst of things so accustomed .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 44]: Sunshine fell sweetly upon porch and backyard ; yonder was the familiar stable , and from its interior came the busy hum of a carpenter shop , established that morning by Duke 's young master , in association with Samuel Williams and Herman .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 86]: Here , close by , were the quiet refuse-can and the wonted brooms and mops leaning against the latticed wall at the end of the porch , and there , by the foot of the steps , was the stone slab of the cistern , with the iron cover displaced and lying beside the round opening , where the carpenters had left it , not half an hour ago , after lowering a stick of wood into the water , `` to season it '' .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 45]: All about Duke were these usual and reassuring environs of his daily life , and yet it was his fate to behold , right in the midst of them , and in ghastly juxtaposition to his face , a thing of nightmare and lunacy .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 9]: Gipsy had seized the fishbone by the middle .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 57]: Out from one side of his head , and mingling with his whiskers , projected the long , spiked spine of the big fish ; down from the other side of that ferocious head dangled the fish 's tail , and from above the remarkable effect thus produced shot the intolerable glare of two yellow eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 27]: To the gaze of Duke , still blurred by slumber , this monstrosity was all of one piece the bone seemed a living part of it .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 18]: What he saw was like those interesting insect-faces that the magnifying glass reveals to great M. Fabre .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 30]: It was impossible for Duke to maintain the philosophic calm of M. Fabre , however ; there was no magnifying glass between him and this spined and spiky face .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 15]: Indeed , Duke was not in a position to think the matter over quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 45]: If he had been able to do that , he would have said to himself : `` We have here an animal of most peculiar and unattractive appearance , though , upon examination , it seems to be only a cat stealing a fishbone .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 28]: Nevertheless , as the thief is large beyond all my recollection of cats and has an unpleasant stare , I will leave this spot at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 21]: On the contrary , Duke was so electrified by his horrid awakening that he completely lost his presence of mind .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 53]: In the very instant of his first eye 's opening , the other eye and his mouth behaved similarly , the latter loosing upon the quiet air one shriek of mental agony before the little dog scrambled to his feet and gave further employment to his voice in a frenzy of profanity .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 34]: At the same time the subterranean diapason of a demoniac bass viol was heard ; it rose to a wail , and rose and rose again till it screamed like a small siren .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 20]: It was Gipsy 's war-cry , and , at the sound of it , Duke became a frothing maniac .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 15]: He made a convulsive frontal attack upon the hobgoblin -- and the massacre began .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 48]: Never releasing the fishbone for an instant , Gipsy laid back his ears in a chilling way , beginning to shrink into himself like a concertina , but rising amidships so high that he appeared to be giving an imitation of that peaceful beast , the dromedary .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 33]: Such was not his purpose , however , for , having attained his greatest possible altitude , he partially sat down and elevated his right arm after the manner of a semaphore .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 20]: This semaphore arm remained rigid for a second , threatening ; then it vibrated with inconceivable rapidity , feinting .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 11]: But it was the treacherous left that did the work .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 27]: Seemingly this left gave Duke three lightning little pats upon the right ear ; but the change in his voice indicated that these were no love-taps .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 6]: He yelled `` help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 6]: and `` bloody murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 17]: Never had such a shattering uproar , all vocal , broken out upon a peaceful afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 36]: Gipsy possessed a vocabulary for cat-swearing certainly second to none out of Italy , and probably equal to the best there , while Duke remembered and uttered things he had not thought of for years .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 17]: The hum of the carpenter shop ceased , and Sam Williams appeared in the stable doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 4]: He stared insanely .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 5]: `` My gorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 18]: `` Duke 's havin ' a fight with the biggest cat you ever saw in your life !
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 3]: C'mon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 19]: His feet were already in motion toward the battlefield , with Penrod and Herman hurrying in his wake .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 29]: Onward they sped , and Duke was encouraged by the sight and sound of these reenforcements to increase his own outrageous clamours and to press home his attack .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 5]: But he was ill-advised .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 28]: This time it was the right arm of the semaphore that dipped -- and Duke 's honest nose was but too conscious of what happened in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 19]: A lump of dirt struck the refuse-can with violence , and Gipsy beheld the advance of overwhelming forces .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 16]: They rushed upon him from two directions , cutting off the steps of the porch .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 23]: Undaunted , the formidable cat raked Duke 's nose again , somewhat more lingeringly , and prepared to depart with his fishbone .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 42]: He had little fear for himself , because he was inclined to think that , unhampered , he could whip anything on earth ; still , things seemed to be growing rather warm and he saw nothing to prevent his leaving .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 46]: And though he could laugh in the face of so unequal an antagonist as Duke , Gipsy felt that he was never at his best or able to do himself full justice unless he could perform that feline operation inaccurately known as `` spitting '' .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 78]: To his notion , this was an absolute essential to combat ; but , as all cats of the slightest pretensions to technique perfectly understand , it can neither be well done nor produce the best effects unless the mouth be opened to its utmost capacity so as to expose the beginnings of the alimentary canal , down which -- at least that is the intention of the threat -- the opposing party will soon be passing .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 12]: And Gipsy could not open his mouth without relinquishing his fishbone .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 21]: Therefore , on small accounts he decided to leave the field to his enemies and to carry the fishbone elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 6]: He took two giant leaps .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 11]: The first landed him upon the edge of the porch .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 29]: There , without an instant 's pause , he gathered his fur-sheathed muscles , concentrated himself into one big steel spring , and launched himself superbly into space .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 29]: He made a stirring picture , however brief , as he left the solid porch behind him and sailed upward on an ascending curve into the sunlit air .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 17]: His head was proudly up ; he was the incarnation of menacing power and of self-confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 41]: It is possible that the whitefish 's spinal column and flopping tail had interfered with his vision , and in launching himself he may have mistaken the dark , round opening of the cistern for its dark , round cover .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 50]: In that case , it was a leap calculated and executed with precision , for as the boys clamoured their pleased astonishment , Gipsy descended accurately into the orifice and passed majestically from public view , with the fishbone still in his mouth and his haughty head still high .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 6]: There was a grand splash !
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 61]: CONCERNING TROUSERS Duke , hastening to place himself upon the stone slab , raged at his enemy in safety ; and presently the indomitable Gipsy could be heard from the darkness below , turning on the bass of his siren , threatening the water that enveloped him , returning Duke 's profanity with interest , and cursing the general universe .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 5]: `` You hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 7]: Penrod stormed , rushing at Duke .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 8]: `` You go ` way from here !
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 4]: You DUKE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 28]: And Duke , after prostrating himself , decided that it would be a relief to obey and to consider his responsibilities in this matter at an end .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 12]: He withdrew beyond a corner of the house , thinking deeply .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 14]: `` Why 'n' t you let him bark at the ole cat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 9]: Sam Williams inquired , sympathizing with the oppressed .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 24]: `` I guess you 'd want to bark if a cat had been treatin ' you the way this one did Duke . ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 19]: `` Well , we got to get this cat out o ' here , have n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 4]: Penrod demanded crossly .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 5]: `` What fer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 3]: Herman asked .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 5]: `` Mighty mean cat !
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 14]: If it was me , I let ` at ole cat drownd . ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 8]: `` My goodness , '' Penrod cried .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 10]: `` What you want to let it drown for ?
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 16]: Anyways , we got to use this water in our house , have n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 23]: You do n't s ` pose people like to use water that 's got a cat drowned in it , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 39]: It gets pumped up into the tank in the attic and goes all over the house , and I bet you would n't want to see your father and mother usin ' water a cat was drowned in .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 23]: I guess I do n't want my father and moth -- '' `` Well , how CAN we get it out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 9]: Sam asked , cutting short this virtuous oration .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 40]: `` It 's swimmin ' around down there , '' he continued , peering into the cistern , `` and kind of roaring , and it must of dropped its fishbone , 'cause it 's spittin ' just awful .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 13]: I guess maybe it 's mad 'cause it fell in there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 40]: `` I do n't know how it 's goin ' to be got out , '' said Penrod ; `` but I know it 's GOT to be got out , and that 's all there is to it !
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 92]: I 'm not goin ' to have my father and mother -- '' `` Well , once , '' said Sam , `` once when a kitten fell down OUR cistern , Papa took a pair of his trousers , and he held 'em by the end of one leg , and let 'em hang down through the hole till the end of the other leg was in the water , and the kitten went and clawed hold of it , and he pulled it right up , easy as anything .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 30]: Well , that 's the way to do now , 'cause if a kitten could keep hold of a pair of trousers , I guess this ole cat could .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 11]: It 's the biggest cat _ I _ ever saw !
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 37]: All you got to do is to go and ast your mother for a pair of your father 's trousers , and we 'll have this ole cat out o ' there in no time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 7]: Penrod glanced toward the house perplexedly .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 28]: `` She ai n't home , and I 'd be afraid to -- '' `` Well , take your own , then , '' Sam suggested briskly .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 25]: `` You take 'em off in the stable , and wait in there , and I and Herman 'll get the cat out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 15]: Penrod had no enthusiasm for this plan ; but he affected to consider it .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 38]: `` Well , I do n't know ` bout that , '' he said , and then , after gazing attentively into the cistern and making some eye measurements of his knickerbockers , he shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 7]: `` They 'd be too short .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 9]: They would n't be NEAR long enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 11]: `` Then neither would mine , '' said Sam promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 9]: `` Herman 's would , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 6]: `` No , suh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 23]: Herman had recently been promoted to long trousers , and he expressed a strong disinclination to fall in with Penrod 's idea .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 35]: `` My Mammy sit up late nights sewin ' on ` ese britches fer me , makin ' 'em outen of a pair o ' pappy 's , an ' they mighty good britches .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 13]: Ain ' goin ' have no wet cat climbin ' up 'em !
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 5]: No , suh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 22]: Both boys began to walk toward him argumentatively , while he moved slowly backward , shaking his head and denying them .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 11]: `` I do n't keer how much you talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 50]: `` Mammy gave my OLE britches to Verman , an ' ` ese here ones on ' y britches I got now , an ' I 'm go ' to keep 'em on me -- not take 'em off an ' let ole wet cat splosh all over 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 21]: My Mammy , she sewed 'em fer ME , I reckon -- d'in ' sew 'em fer no cat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 11]: `` Oh , PLEASE , come on , Herman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 4]: Penrod begged pathetically .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 16]: `` You do n't want to see the poor cat drown , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 6]: `` Mighty mean cat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 3]: Herman said .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 15]: `` Bet ' let ` at ole pussy-cat ` lone whur it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 14]: `` Why , it 'll only take a minute , '' Sam urged .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 25]: `` You just wait inside the stable and you 'll have 'em back on again before you could say ` Jack Robinson . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 17]: `` I ain ' got no use to say no Jack Robason , '' said Herman .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 19]: `` An ' I ain ' go ' to han ' over my britches fer NO cat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 11]: `` Listen here , Herman , '' Penrod began pleadingly .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 19]: `` You can watch us every minute through the crack in the stable door , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 13]: We ai n't goin ' to HURT 'em any , are we ?
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 11]: You can see everything we do , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 24]: Look at here , Herman : you know that little saw you said you wished it was yours , in the carpenter shop ?
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 33]: Well , honest , if you 'll just let us take your trousers till we get this poor ole cat out the cistern , I 'll give you that little saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 11]: Herman was shaken ; he yearned for the little saw .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 9]: `` You gim me her to keep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 4]: he asked cautiously .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 15]: `` You gim me her befo ' I han ' over my britches ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 6]: `` You 'll see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 21]: Penrod ran into the stable , came back with the little saw , and placed it in Herman 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 41]: Herman could resist no longer , and two minutes later he stood in the necessary negligee within the shelter of the stable door , and watched , through the crack , the lowering of the surrendered garment into the cistern .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 51]: His gaze was anxious , and surely nothing could have been more natural , since the removal had exposed Herman 's brown legs , and , although the weather was far from inclement , November is never quite the month for people to be out of doors entirely without leg-covering .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 29]: Therefore , he marked with impatience that Sam and Penrod , after lowering the trousers partway to the water , had withdrawn them and fallen into an argument .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 9]: `` Name o ' goo ` ness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 3]: Herman shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 16]: `` I ain ' got no time fer you all do so much talkin ' .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 18]: If you go ' git ` at cat out , why 'n' t you GIT him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 46]: `` Wait just a minute , '' Penrod called , and he came running to the stable , seized upon a large wooden box , which the carpenters had fitted with a lid and leather hinges , and returned with it cumbersomely to the cistern .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 9]: `` That 'll do to put it in .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 14]: It wo n't get out o ' that , I bet you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 58]: `` Well , I 'd like to know what you want to keep it for , '' Sam said peevishly , and , with the suggestion of a sneer , he added , `` I s ` pose you think somebody 'll pay about a hunderd dollars reward or something , on account of a cat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 8]: `` I do n't , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 4]: Penrod protested hotly .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 14]: `` I know what I 'm doin ' , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 21]: `` Well , what on earth -- '' `` I 'll tell you some day , wo n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 3]: Penrod cried .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 22]: `` I got my reasons for wantin ' to keep this cat , and I 'm goin ' to keep it .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 19]: YOU do n't haf to ke -- '' `` Well , all right , '' Sam said shortly .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 14]: `` Anyways , it 'll be dead if you do n't hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 20]: `` It wo n't , either , '' Penrod returned , kneeling and peering down upon the dark water .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 5]: `` Listen to him !
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 11]: He 's growlin ' and spittin ' away like anything !
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 13]: It takes a mighty fine-blooded cat to be as fierce as that .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 16]: I bet you most cats would ` a ' given up and drowned long ago .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 20]: The water 's awful cold , and I expect he was perty supprised when he lit in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 13]: `` Herman 's makin ' a fuss again , '' Sam said .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 19]: `` We better get the ole cat out o ' there if we 're goin ' to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 27]: `` Well , this is the way we 'll do , '' Penrod said authoritatively : `` I 'll let you hold the trousers , Sam .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 25]: You lay down and keep hold of one leg , and let the other one hang down till its end is in the water .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 43]: Then you kind of swish it around till it 's somewheres where the cat can get hold of it , and soon as he does , you pull it up , and be mighty careful so 's it do n't fall off .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 18]: Then I 'll grab it and stick it in the box and slam the lid down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 28]: Rather pleased to be assigned to the trousers , Sam accordingly extended himself at full length upon the slab and proceeded to carry out Penrod 's instructions .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 18]: Meanwhile , Penrod , peering from above , inquired anxiously for information concerning this work of rescue .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 8]: `` Can you see it , Sam ?
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 7]: Why do n't it grab hold ?
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 10]: What 's it doin ' now , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 14]: `` It 's spittin ' at Herman 's trousers , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 11]: `` My gracious , but it 's a fierce cat !
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 20]: If it 's mad all the time like this , you better not ever try to pet it much .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 12]: Now it 's kind o ' sniffin ' at the trousers .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 14]: It acks to me as if it was goin ' to ketch hold .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 13]: Yes , it 's stuck one claw in 'em -- OW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 9]: Sam uttered a blood-curdling shriek and jerked convulsively .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 22]: The next instant , streaming and inconceivably gaunt , the ravening Gipsy appeared with a final bound upon Sam 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 30]: It was not in Gipsy 's character to be drawn up peaceably ; he had ascended the trousers and Sam 's arm without assistance and in his own way .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 39]: Simultaneously -- for this was a notable case of everything happening at once -- there was a muffled , soggy splash , and the unfortunate Herman , smit with prophecy in his seclusion , uttered a dismal yell .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 34]: Penrod laid hands upon Gipsy , and , after a struggle suggestive of sailors landing a man-eating shark , succeeded in getting him into the box , and sat upon the lid thereof .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 12]: Sam had leaped to his feet , empty handed and vociferous .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 7]: `` Ow ow , OUCH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 12]: he shouted , as he rubbed his suffering arm and shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 25]: Then , exasperated by Herman 's lamentations , he called angrily : `` Oh , what _ I _ care for your ole britches ?
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 28]: I guess if you 'd ` a ' had a cat climb up YOU , you 'd ` a ' dropped 'em a hunderd times over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 51]: However , upon excruciating entreaty , he consented to explore the surface of the water with a clothes-prop , but reported that the luckless trousers had disappeared in the depths , Herman having forgotten to remove some `` fishin ' sinkers '' from his pockets before making the fated loan .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 10]: Penrod was soothing a lacerated wrist in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 12]: `` That 's a mighty fine-blooded cat , '' he remarked .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 23]: `` I expect it 'd got away from pretty near anybody , ` specially if they did n't know much about cats .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 10]: Listen at him , in the box , Sam .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 16]: I bet you never heard a cat growl as loud as that in your life .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 12]: I should n't wonder it was part panther or sumpthing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 10]: Sam began to feel more interest and less resentment .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 31]: `` I tell you what we can do , Penrod , '' he said : `` Let 's take it in the stable and make the box into a cage .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 31]: We can take off the hinges and slide back the lid a little at a time , and nail some o ' those laths over the front for bars . ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 14]: `` That 's just exackly what I was goin ' to say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 3]: Penrod exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 10]: `` I already thought o ' that , Sam .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 29]: Yessir , we 'll make it just like a reg ` lar circus-cage , and our good ole cat can look out from between the bars and growl .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 15]: It 'll come in pretty handy if we ever decide to have another show .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 23]: Anyways , we 'll have her in there , good and tight , where we can watch she do n't get away .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 13]: I got a mighty good reason to keep this cat , Sam .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 5]: You 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 20]: `` Well , why do n't you -- '' Sam was interrupted by n vehement appeal from the stable .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 9]: `` Oh , we 're comin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 16]: `` We got to bring our cat in its cage , have n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 10]: `` Listen , Herman , '' Penrod called absent-mindedly .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 36]: `` Bring us some bricks , or something awful heavy to put on the lid of our cage , so we can carry it without our good ole cat pushin ' the lid open . ''
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 26]: Herman explained with vehemence that it would not be right for him to leave the stable upon any errand until just restorations had been made .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 30]: He spoke inimically of the cat that had been the occasion of his loss , and he earnestly requested that operations with the clothes-prop be resumed in the cistern .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 27]: Sam and Penrod declined , on the ground that this was absolutely proven to be of no avail , and Sam went to look for bricks .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 7]: These two boys were not unfeeling .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 25]: They sympathized with Herman ; but they regarded the trousers as a loss about which there was no use in making so much outcry .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 15]: To them , it was part of an episode that ought to be closed .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 34]: They had done their best , and Sam had not intended to drop the trousers ; that was something no one could have helped , and therefore no one was to be blamed .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 18]: What they were now interested in was the construction of a circus-cage for their good ole cat .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 33]: `` It 's goin ' to be a cage just exactly like circus-cages , Herman , '' Penrod said , as he and Sam set the box down on the stable floor .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 23]: `` You can help us nail the bars and -- '' `` I ain ' studyin ' ` bout no bars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 4]: Herman interrupted fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 18]: `` What good you reckon nailin ' bars go ' do me if Mammy holler fer me ?
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 11]: You white boys sutn ' y show me bad day !
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 18]: I try treat people nice , 'n' en they go th ` ow my britches down cistern !
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 6]: `` I did not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 3]: Sam protested .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 27]: `` That ole cat just kicked 'em out o ' my hand with its hind feet while its front ones were stickin ' in my arm .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 14]: I bet YOU 'D of -- '' `` Blame it on cat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 4]: Herman sneered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 5]: ` At 's nice !
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 15]: Jes ' looky here minute : Who 'd I len ' 'em britches to ?
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 10]: D' I len ' 'em britches to thishere cat ?
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 10]: No , suh ; you know I didn ' !
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 28]: You know well 's any man I len ' 'em britches to you -- an ' you tuck an ' th ` owed 'em down cistern ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 12]: `` Oh , PLEASE hush up about your old britches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 4]: Penrod said plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 32]: `` I got to think how we 're goin ' to fix our cage up right , and you make so much noise I ca n't get my mind on it .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 12]: Anyways , did n't I give you that little saw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 5]: `` Li'l saw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 5]: Herman cried , unmollified .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 24]: `` Yes ; an ' thishere li'l saw go ' do me lot o ' good when I got to go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 16]: `` Why , it 's only across the alley to your house , Herman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 3]: said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 21]: `` That ai n't anything at all to step over there , and you 've got your little saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 4]: `` Aw right !
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 21]: You jes ' take off you ' closes an ' step ` cross the alley , '' said Herman bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 10]: `` I give you li'l saw to carry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 9]: Penrod had begun to work upon the cage .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 93]: `` Now listen here , Herman , '' he said : `` if you 'll quit talkin ' so much , and kind of get settled down or sumpthing , and help us fix a good cage for our panther , well , when mamma comes home about five o'clock , I 'll go and tell her there 's a poor boy got his britches burned up in a fire , and how he 's waitin ' out in the stable for some , and I 'll tell her I promised him .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 29]: Well , she 'll give me a pair I wore for summer ; honest she will , and you can put 'em on as quick as anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 18]: `` There , Herman , '' said Sam ; `` now you 're all right again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 6]: `` WHO all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 3]: Herman complained .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 18]: `` I like feel sump 'm ' roun ' my laigs befo ' no five o'clock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 16]: `` Well , you 're sure to get 'em by then , '' Penrod promised .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 9]: `` It ai n't winter yet , Herman .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 22]: Come on and help saw these laths for the bars , Herman , and Sam and I 'll nail 'em on .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 19]: It ai n't long till five o'clock , Herman , and then you 'll just feel fine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 16]: Herman was not convinced ; but he found himself at a disadvantage in the argument .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 23]: The question at issue seemed a vital one to him -- and yet his two opponents evidently considered it of minor importance .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 29]: Obviously , they felt that the promise for five o'clock had settled the whole matter conclusively ; but to Herman this did not appear to be the fact .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 29]: However , he helplessly suffered himself to be cajoled back into carpentry , though he was extremely ill at ease and talked a great deal of his misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 42]: He shivered and grumbled , and , by his passionate urgings , compelled Penrod to go into the house so many times to see what time it was by the kitchen clock that both his companions almost lost patience with him .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 13]: said Penrod , returning from performing this errand for the fourth time .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 30]: `` It 's twenty minutes after three , and I 'm not goin ' in to look at that ole clock again if I haf to die for it !
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 21]: I never heard anybody make such a fuss in my life , and I 'm gettin ' tired of it .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 16]: Must think we want to be all night fixin ' this cage for our panther !
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 39]: If you ask me to go and see what time it is again , Herman , I 'm a-goin ' to take back about askin ' mamma at five o'clock , and THEN where 'll you be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 18]: `` Well , it seem like mighty long aft ` noon to me , '' Herman sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 18]: `` I jes ' like to know what time it is gettin ' to be now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 5]: `` Look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 4]: Penrod warned him .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 26]: `` You heard what I was just tellin ' you about how I 'd take back -- '' `` Nemmine , '' Herman said hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 8]: `` I wasn ' astin ' you .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 18]: I jes ' sayin ' sump 'm ' kind o ' to myse ' f like . ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 23]: CAMERA WORK IN THE JUNGLE The completed cage , with Gipsy behind the bars , framed a spectacle sufficiently thrilling and panther-like .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 35]: Gipsy raved , `` spat '' , struck virulently at taunting fingers , turned on his wailing siren for minutes at a time , and he gave his imitation of a dromedary almost continuously .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 33]: These phenomena could be intensified in picturesqueness , the boys discovered , by rocking the cage a little , tapping it with a hammer , or raking the bars with a stick .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 9]: Altogether , Gipsy was having a lively afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 18]: There came a vigorous rapping on the alley door of the stable , and Verman was admitted .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 6]: `` Yay , Verman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 4]: cried Sam Williams .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 11]: `` Come and look at our good ole panther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 10]: Another curiosity , however , claimed Verman 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 13]: His eyes opened wide , and he pointed at Herman 's legs .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 7]: `` Wha ' ma ' oo ?
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 8]: Mammy hay oo hip ap hoe-woob . ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 10]: `` Mammy tell ME git ` at stove-wood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 4]: Herman interpreted resentfully .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 26]: `` How 'm I go ' git ` at stove-wood when my britches down bottom ` at cistern , I like you answer ME please ?
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 10]: You shet ` at do ' behime you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 17]: Verman complied , and again pointing to his brother 's legs , requested to be enlightened .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 21]: `` Sin ' I tole you once they down bottom ` at cistern , '' Herman shouted , much exasperated .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 14]: `` You wan ' know how come so , you ast Sam Williams .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 15]: He say thishere cat tuck an ' th ` owed 'em down there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 16]: Sam , who was busy rocking the cage , remained cheerfully absorbed in that occupation .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 15]: `` Come look at our good ole panther , Verman , '' he called .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 35]: `` I 'll get this circus-cage rockin ' right good , an ' then -- '' `` Wait a minute , '' said Penrod ; `` I got sumpthing I got to think about .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 5]: Quit rockin ' it !
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 22]: I guess I got a right to think about sumpthing without havin ' to go deaf , have n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 26]: Having obtained the quiet so plaintively requested , he knit his brow and gazed intently upon Verman , then upon Herman , then upon Gipsy .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 6]: Evidently his idea was fermenting .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 9]: He broke the silence with a shout . ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 7]: _ I _ know , Sam !
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 8]: I know what we 'll do NOW !
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 46]: I just thought of it , and it 's goin ' to be sumpthing I bet there are n't any other boys in this town could do , because where would they get any good ole panther like we got , and Herman and Verman ?
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 22]: And they 'd haf to have a dog , too -- and we got our good ole Dukie , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 18]: I bet we have the greatest ole time this afternoon we ever had in our lives ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 24]: His enthusiasm roused the warm interest of Sam -- and Verman , though Herman , remaining cold and suspicious , asked for details .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 34]: `` An ' I like to hear if it 's sump 'm ' , '' he concluded , `` what 's go ' git me my britches back outen ` at cistern ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 13]: `` Well , it ai n't exackly that , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 7]: `` It 's different from that .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 44]: What I 'm thinkin ' about , well , for us to have it the way it ought to be , so 's you and Verman would look like natives -- well , Verman ought to take off his britches , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 4]: `` Mo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 8]: said Verman , shaking his head violently .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 4]: `` Mo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 12]: `` Well , wait a minute , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 4]: Sam Williams said .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 18]: `` Give Penrod a chance to say what he wants to , first , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 6]: Go on , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 40]: `` Well , you know , Sam , '' said Penrod , turning to this sympathetic auditor ; `` you remember that movin ' - pitcher show we went to , ` Fortygraphing Wild Animals in the Jungle ' .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 27]: Well , Herman would n't have to do a thing more to look like those natives we saw that the man called the ` beaters ' .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 21]: They were dressed just about like the way he is now , and if Verman -- '' `` MO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 3]: said Verman .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 10]: `` Oh , WAIT a minute , Verman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 3]: Sam entreated .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 7]: `` Go on , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 20]: `` Well , we can make a mighty good jungle up in the loft , '' Penrod continued eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 31]: `` We can take that ole dead tree that 's out in the alley and some branches , and I bet we could have the best jungle you ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 46]: And then we 'd fix up a kind of place in there for our panther , only , of course , we 'd haf to keep him in the cage so 's he would n't run away ; but we 'd pretend he was loose .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 11]: And then you remember how they did with that calf ?
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 26]: Well , we 'd have Duke for the tied-up calf for the panther to come out and jump on , so they could fortygraph him .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 26]: Herman can be the chief beater , and we 'll let Verman be the other beaters , and I 'll -- '' `` Yay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 4]: shouted Sam Williams .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 9]: `` I 'll be the fortygraph man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 29]: `` No , '' said Penrod ; `` you be the one with the gun that guards the fortygraph man , because I 'm the fortygraph man already .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 15]: You can fix up a mighty good gun with this carpenter shop , Sam .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 47]: We 'll make spears for our good ole beaters , too , and I 'm goin ' to make me a camera out o ' that little starch-box and a bakin ' - powder can that 's goin ' to be a mighty good ole camera .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 12]: We can do lots more things -- '' `` Yay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 3]: Sam cried .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 7]: `` Let 's get started ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 3]: He paused .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 7]: `` Wait a minute , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 16]: Verman says he wo n't -- '' `` Well , he 's got to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 3]: said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 5]: `` I momp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 6]: Verman insisted , almost distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 17]: They began to argue with him ; but , for a time , Verman remained firm .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 28]: They upheld the value of dramatic consistency , declaring that a beater dressed as completely as he was `` would n't look like anything at all '' .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 24]: He would `` spoil the whole biznuss '' , they said , and they praised Herman for the faithful accuracy of his costume .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 55]: They also insisted that the garment in question was much too large for Verman , anyway , having been so recently worn by Herman and turned over to Verman with insufficient alteration , and they expressed surprise that `` anybody with any sense '' should make such a point of clinging to a misfit .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 43]: Herman sided against his brother in this controversy , perhaps because a certain loneliness , of which he was censcious , might be assuaged by the company of another trouserless person -- or it may be that his motive was more sombre .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 27]: Possibly he remembered that Verman 's trousers were his own former property and might fit him in case the promise for five o'clock turned out badly .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 32]: At all events , Verman finally yielded under great pressure , and consented to appear in the proper costume of the multitude of beaters it now became his duty to personify .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 14]: Shouting , the boys dispersed to begin the preparation of their jungle scene .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 50]: Sam and Penrod went for branches and the dead tree , while Herman and Verman carried the panther in his cage to the loft , where the first thing that Verman did was to hang his trousers on a nail in a conspicuous and accessible spot near the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 30]: And with the arrival of Penrod and Sam , panting and dragging no inconsiderable thicket after them , the coloured brethren began to take a livelier interest in things .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 41]: Indeed , when Penrod , a little later , placed in their hands two spears , pointed with tin , their good spirits were entirely restored , and they even began to take a pride in being properly uncostumed beaters .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 15]: Sam 's gun and Penrod 's camera were entirely satisfactory , especially the latter .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 29]: The camera was so attractive , in fact , that the hunter and the chief beater and all the other beaters immediately resigned and insisted upon being photographers .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 17]: Each had to be given a `` turn '' before the jungle project could be resumed .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 38]: `` Now , for goodnesses ' sakes , '' said Penrod , taking the camera from Verman , `` I hope you 're done , so 's we can get started doin something like we ought to !
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 10]: We got to have Duke for a tied-up calf .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 28]: We 'll have to bring him and tie him out here in front the jungle , and then the panther 'll come out and jump on him .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 10]: Wait , and I 'll go bring him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 20]: Departing upon this errand , Penrod found Duke enjoying the declining rays of the sun in the front yard .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 6]: `` Hyuh , Duke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 9]: called his master , in an indulgent tone .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 8]: `` Come on , good ole Dukie !
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 4]: Come along ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 7]: Duke rose conscientiously and followed him .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 8]: `` I got him , men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 6]: Penrod called from the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 14]: `` I got our good ole calf all ready to be tied up .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 5]: Here he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 14]: And he appeared in the doorway with the unsuspecting little dog beside him .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 22]: Gipsy , who had been silent for some moments , instantly raised his banshee battlecry , and Duke yelped in horror .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 17]: Penrod made a wild effort to hold him ; but Duke was not to be detained .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 49]: Unnatural strength and activity came to him in his delirium , and , for the second or two that the struggle lasted , his movements were too rapid for the eyes of the spectators to follow -- merely a whirl and blur in the air could be seen .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 18]: Then followed a sound of violent scrambling and Penrod sprawled alone at the top of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 13]: `` Well , why 'n' t you come and help me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 4]: he demanded indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 18]: `` I could n't get him back now if I was to try a million years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 11]: `` What we goin ' to do about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 3]: Sam asked .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 7]: Penrod rose and dusted his knees .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 15]: `` We got to get along without any tied-up calf -- that 's certain !
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 13]: But I got to take those fortygraphs SOME way or other ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 17]: `` Me an ' Verman aw ready begin ` at beatin ' , '' Herman suggested .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 9]: `` You tole us we the beaters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 21]: `` Well , wait a minute , '' said Penrod , whose feeling for realism in drama was always alert .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 18]: `` I want to get a mighty good pitcher o ' that ole panther this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 24]: As he spoke , he threw open the wide door intended for the delivery of hay into the loft from the alley below .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 33]: `` Now , bring the cage over here by this door so 's I can get a better light ; it 's gettin ' kind of dark over where the jungle is .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 28]: We 'll pretend there is n't any cage there , and soon as I get him fortygraphed , I 'll holler , ` Shoot , men ! '
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 28]: Then you must shoot , Sam -- and Herman , you and Verman must hammer on the cage with your spears , and holler : ` Hoo !
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 3]: Hoo ! '
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 9]: and pretend you 're spearin ' him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 8]: `` Well , we aw ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 3]: said Herman .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 3]: `` Hoo !
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 3]: Hoo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 14]: `` Wait a minute , '' Penrod interposed , frowningly surveying the cage .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 15]: `` I got to squat too much to get my camera fixed right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 18]: He assumed various solemn poses , to be interpreted as those of a photographer studying his subject .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 18]: `` No , '' he said finally ; `` it wo n't take good that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 5]: `` My gootness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 3]: Herman exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 12]: `` When we goin ' begin ` at beatin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 8]: Apparently Penrod had solved a weighty problem .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 16]: `` Bring that busted ole kitchen chair , and set the panther up on it .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 5]: THAT 'S the ticket !
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 12]: This way , it 'll make a mighty good pitcher ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 6]: He turned to Sam importantly .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 15]: `` Well , Jim , is the chief and all his beaters here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 18]: `` Yes , Bill ; all here , '' Sam responded , with an air of loyalty .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 20]: `` Well , then , I guess we 're ready , '' said Penrod , in his deepest voice .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 6]: `` Beat , men . ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 8]: Herman and Verman were anxious to beat .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 12]: They set up the loudest uproar of which they were capable .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 3]: `` Hoo !
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 2]: Hoo !
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 3]: Hoo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 16]: they bellowed , flailing the branches with their spears and stamping heavily upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 18]: Sam , carried away by the elan of the performance , was unable to resist joining them .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 3]: `` Hoo !
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 2]: Hoo !
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 3]: Hoo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 3]: `` Hoo !
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 2]: Hoo !
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 3]: Hoo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 33]: And as the dust rose from the floor to their stamping , the three of them produced such a din and hoo-hooing as could be made by nothing on earth except boys .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 6]: `` Back , men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 10]: Penrod called , raising his voice to the utmost .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 6]: `` Back for your lives .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 3]: The PA-A-ANTHER !
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 8]: Now I 'm takin ' his pitcher .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 4]: Click , click !
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 7]: Shoot , men ; shoot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 3]: `` Bing !
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 3]: Bing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 32]: shouted Sam , levelling his gun at the cage , while Herman and Verman hammered upon it , and Gipsy cursed boys , the world and the day he was born .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 3]: `` Bing !
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 2]: Bing !
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 3]: Bing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 6]: `` You missed him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 3]: screamed Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 7]: `` Give me that gun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 16]: And snatching it from Sam 's unwilling hand , he levelled it at the cage .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 4]: `` BING ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 29]: Simultaneously there was the sound of another report ; but this was an actual one and may best be symbolized by the statement that it was a whack .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 41]: The recipient was Herman , and , outrageously surprised and pained , he turned to find himself face to face with a heavily built coloured woman who had recently ascended the stairs and approached the preoccupied hunters from the rear .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 24]: In her hand was a lath , and , even as Herman turned , it was again wielded , this time upon Verman .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 4]: `` MAMMY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 12]: `` Yes ; you bettuh holler , ` Mammy ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 3]: she panted .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 16]: `` My goo ` ness , if yo ' pappy don ' lam you to-night !
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 22]: Ain ' you got no mo ' sense ` an to let white boys ` suede you play you Affikin heathums ?
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 5]: Whah you britches ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 9]: `` Yonnuh Verman 's , '' quavered Herman .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 6]: `` Whah y' own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 22]: Choking , Herman answered bravely : '' ` At ole cat tuck an ' th ` owed 'em down cistern ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 11]: Exasperated almost beyond endurance , she lifted the lath again .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 35]: But unfortunately , in order to obtain a better field of action , she moved backward a little , coming in contact with the bars of the cage , a circumstance that she overlooked .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 27]: More unfortunately still , the longing of the captive to express his feelings was such that he would have welcomed the opportunity to attack an elephant .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 28]: He had been striking and scratching at inanimate things and at boys out of reach for the past hour ; but here at last was his opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 7]: He made the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 14]: `` I learn you tell me cat th ` owed -- OOOOH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 41]: The coloured woman leaped into the air like an athlete , and , turning with a swiftness astounding in one of her weight , beheld the semaphoric arm of Gipsy again extended between the bars and hopefully reaching for her .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 29]: Beside herself , she lifted her right foot briskly from the ground , and allowed the sole of her shoe to come in contact with Gipsy 's cage .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 10]: The cage moved from the tottering chair beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 47]: It passed through the yawning hay-door and fell resoundingly to the alley below , where -- as Penrod and Sam , with cries of dismay , rushed to the door and looked down -- it burst asunder and disgorged a large , bruised and chastened cat .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 12]: Gipsy paused and bent one strange look upon the broken box .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 23]: Then he shook his head and departed up the alley , the two boys watching him till he was out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 15]: Before they turned , a harrowing procession issued from the carriage-house doors beneath them .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 14]: Herman came first , hurriedly completing a temporary security in Verman 's trousers .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 18]: Verman followed , after a little reluctance that departed coincidentally with some inspiriting words from the rear .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 20]: He crossed the alley hastily , and his Mammy stalked behind , using constant eloquence and a frequent lath .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 14]: They went into the small house across the way and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 6]: Then Sam turned to Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 26]: `` Penrod , '' he said thoughtfully , `` was it on account of fortygraphing in the jungle you wanted to keep that cat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 10]: `` No ; that was a mighty fine-blooded cat .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 8]: We 'd of made some money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 3]: Sam jeered .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 17]: `` You mean when we 'd sell tickets to look at it in its cage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 41]: Penrod shook his head , and if Gipsy could have overheard and understood his reply , that atrabilious spirit , almost broken by the events of the day , might have considered this last blow the most overwhelming of all .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 14]: `` No , '' said Penrod ; `` when she had kittens . ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 23]: A MODEL LETTER TO A FRIEND On Monday morning Penrod 's faith in the coming of another Saturday was flaccid and lustreless .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 23]: Those Japanese lovers who were promised a reunion after ten thousand years in separate hells were brighter with hope than he was .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 8]: On Monday Penrod was virtually an agnostic .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 17]: Nowhere upon his shining morning face could have been read any eager anticipation of useful knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 54]: Of course he had been told that school was for his own good ; in fact , he had been told and told and told , but the words conveying this information , meaningless at first , assumed , with each repetition , more and more the character of dull and unsolicited insult .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 70]: He was wholly unable to imagine circumstances , present or future , under which any of the instruction and training he was now receiving could be of the slightest possible use or benefit to himself ; and when he was informed that such circumstances would frequently arise in his later life , he but felt the slur upon his coming manhood and its power to prevent any such unpleasantness .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 59]: If it were possible to place a romantic young Broadway actor and athlete under hushing supervision for six hours a day , compelling him to bend his unremittent attention upon the city directory of Sheboygan , Wisconsin , he could scarce be expected to respond genially to frequent statements that the compulsion was all for his own good .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 33]: On the contrary , it might be reasonable to conceive his response as taking the form of action , which is precisely the form that Penrod 's smouldering impulse yearned to take .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 14]: To Penrod school was merely a state of confinement , envenomed by mathematics .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 67]: For interminable periods he was forced to listen to information concerning matters about which he had no curiosity whatever ; and he had to read over and over the dullest passages in books that bored him into stupors , while always there overhung the preposterous task of improvising plausible evasions to conceal the fact that he did not know what he had no wish to know .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 27]: Likewise , he must always be prepared to avoid incriminating replies to questions that he felt nobody had a real and natural right to ask him .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 26]: And when his gorge rose and his inwards revolted , the hours became a series of ignoble misadventures and petty disgraces strikingly lacking in privacy .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 60]: It was usually upon Wednesday that his sufferings culminated ; the nervous strength accumulated during the holiday hours at the end of the week would carry him through Monday and Tuesday ; but by Wednesday it seemed ultimately proven that the next Saturday actually never was coming , `` this time '' , and the strained spirit gave way .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 38]: Wednesday was the day averaging highest in Penrod 's list of absences ; but the time came when he felt that the advantages attendant upon his Wednesday `` sick headache '' did not compensate for its inconveniences .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 60]: For one thing , this illness had become so symmetrically recurrent that even the cook felt that he was pushing it too far , and the liveliness of her expression , when he was able to leave his couch and take the air in the backyard at about ten o'clock , became more disagreeable to him with each convalescence .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 67]: There visibly increased , too , about the whole household , an atmosphere of uncongeniality and suspicion so pronounced that every successive illness was necessarily more severe , and at last the patient felt obliged to remain bedded until almost eleven , from time to time giving forth pathetic little sounds eloquent of anguish triumphing over Stoic endurance , yet lacking a certain conviction of utterance .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 30]: Finally , his father enacted , and his mother applied , a new and distinctly special bit of legislation , explaining it with simple candour to the prospective beneficiary .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 34]: `` Whenever you really ARE sick , '' they said , `` you can go out and play as soon as you 're well -- that is , if it happens on Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 19]: But when you 're sick on a school-day , you 'll stay in bed till the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 11]: This is going to do you good , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 30]: Physically , their opinion appeared to be affirmed , for Wednesday after Wednesday passed without any recurrence of the attack ; but the spiritual strain may have been damaging .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 22]: And it should be added that if Penrod 's higher nature did suffer from the strain , he was not unique .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 60]: For , confirming the effect of Wednesday upon boys in general , it is probable that , if full statistics concerning cats were available , they would show that cats dread Wednesdays , and that their fear is shared by other animals , and would be shared , to an extent by windows , if windows possessed nervous systems .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 18]: Nor must this probable apprehension on the part of cats and the like be thought mere superstition .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 43]: Cats have superstitions , it is true ; but certain actions inspired by the sight of a boy with a missile in his hand are better evidence of the workings of logic upon a practical nature than of faith in the supernatural .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 54]: Moreover , the attention of family physicians and specialists should be drawn to these significant though obscure phenomena ; for the suffering of cats is a barometer of the nerve-pressure of boys , and it may be accepted as sufficiently established that Wednesday -- after school-hours -- is the worst time for cats .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 54]: After the promulgation of that parental edict , `` You 'll stay in bed till the next morning '' , four weeks went by unflawed by a single absence from the field of duty ; but , when the fifth Wednesday came , Penrod held sore debate within himself before he finally rose .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 59]: In fact , after rising , and while actually engaged with his toilet , he tentatively emitted the series of little moans that was his wonted preliminary to a quiet holiday at home ; and the sound was heard -LRB- as intended -RRB- by Mr. Schofield , who was passing Penrod 's door on his way to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 5]: `` ALL right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 12]: the father said , making use of peculiar and unnecessary emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 8]: `` Stay in bed till to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 8]: Castor-oil , this time , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 43]: Penrod had not hoped much for his experiment ; nevertheless his rebellious blood was sensibly inflamed by the failure , and he accompanied his dressing with a low murmuring -- apparently a bitter dialogue between himself and some unknown but powerful patron .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 12]: Thus he muttered : `` Well , they better NOT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 11]: `` Well , what can I DO about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 9]: `` Well , I 'D show 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 9]: `` Well , I WILL show 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 18]: `` Well , you OUGHT to show 'em ; that 's the way _ I _ do !
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 12]: I just shake 'em around , and say , ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 15]: I guess you do n't know who you 're talkin ' to like that !
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 7]: You better look out ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 17]: `` Well , that 's the way _ I _ 'm goin ' to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 12]: `` Well , go on and DO it , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 28]: `` Well , I AM goin ' -- '' The door of the next room was slightly ajar ; now it swung wide , and Margaret appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 12]: `` Penrod , what on earth are you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 4]: `` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 21]: None o ' your -- '' `` Well , hurry to breakfast , then ; it 's getting late . ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 67]: Lightly she went , humming a tune , leaving the door of her room open , and the eyes of Penrod , as he donned his jacket , chanced to fall upon her desk , where she had thoughtlessly left a letter -- a private missive just begun , and intended solely for the eyes of Mr. Robert Williams , a senior at a far university .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 11]: In such a fashion is coincidence the architect of misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 41]: Penrod 's class in English composition had been instructed , the previous day , to concoct at home and bring to class on Wednesday morning , `` a model letter to a friend on some subject of general interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 60]: Penalty for omission to perform this simple task was definite ; whosoever brought no letter would inevitably be `` kept in '' after school , that afternoon , until the letter was written , and it was precisely a premonition of this misfortune that had prompted Penrod to attempt his experimental moaning upon his father , for , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 14]: he had equipped himself with no model letter , nor any letter whatever .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 26]: In stress of this kind , a boy 's creed is that anything is worth a try ; but his eye for details is poor .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 25]: He sees the future too sweepingly and too much as he would have it seldom providing against inconsistencies of evidence that may damage him .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 58]: For instance , there is a well-known case of two brothers who exhibited to their parents , with pathetic confidence , several imported dried herring on a string , as a proof that the afternoon had been spent , not at a forbidden circus , but with hook and line upon the banks of a neighbouring brook .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 4]: So with Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 27]: He had vital need of a letter , and there before his eyes , upon Margaret 's desk , was apparently the precise thing he needed !
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 48]: From below rose the voice of his mother urging him to the breakfast-table , warning him that he stood in danger of tardiness at school ; he was pressed for time , and acted upon an inspiration that failed to prompt him even to read the letter .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 18]: Hurriedly he wrote `` Dear freind '' at the top of the page Margaret had partially filled .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 32]: Then he signed himself `` Yours respectfuly , Penrod Schofield '' at the bottom , and enclosed the missive within a battered volume entitled , `` Principles of English Composition . ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 37]: With that and other books compacted by a strap , he descended to a breakfast somewhat oppressive but undarkened by any misgivings concerning a `` letter to a friend on some subject of general interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 23]: He felt that a difficulty had been encountered and satisfactorily disposed of ; the matter could now be dismissed from his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 11]: He had plenty of other difficulties to take its place .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 30]: No ; he had no misgivings , nor was he assailed by anything unpleasant in that line , even when the hour struck for the class in English composition .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 52]: If he had been two or three years older , experience might have warned him to take at least the precaution of copying his offering , so that it would appear in his own handwriting when he `` handed it in '' ; but Penrod had not even glanced at it .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 27]: `` I think , '' Miss Spence said , `` I will ask several of you to read your letters aloud before you hand them in .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 9]: Clara Raypole , you may read yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 58]: Penrod was bored but otherwise comfortable ; he had no apprehension that he might be included in the `` several , '' especially as Miss Spence 's beginning with Clara Raypole , a star performer , indicated that her selection of readers would be made from the conscientious and proficient division at the head of the class .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 33]: He listened stoically to the beginning of the first letter , though he was conscious of a dull resentment , inspired mainly by the perfect complacency of Miss Raypole 's voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 42]: ` Dear Cousin Sadie , ' '' she began smoothly , '' ' I thought I would write you to-day on some subject of general interest , and so I thought I would tell you about the subject of our court-house .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 29]: It is a very fine building situated in the centre of the city , and a visit to the building after school hours well repays for the visit .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 28]: Upon entrance we find upon our left the office of the county clerk and upon our right a number of windows affording a view of the street .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 14]: And so we proceed , finding on both sides much of general interest .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 15]: The building was begun in 1886 A.D. and it was through in 1887 A.D. .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 36]: It is four stories high and made of stone , pressed brick , wood , and tiles , with a tower , or cupola , one hundred and twenty-seven feet seven inches from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 39]: Among other subjects of general interest told by the janitor , we learn that the architect of the building was a man named Flanner , and the foundations extend fifteen feet five inches under the ground . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 35]: Penrod was unable to fix his attention upon these statistics ; he began moodily to twist a button of his jacket and to concentrate a new-born and obscure but lasting hatred upon the court-house .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 47]: Miss Raypole 's glib voice continued to press upon his ears ; but , by keeping his eyes fixed upon the twisting button he had accomplished a kind of self-hypnosis , or mental anaesthesia , and was but dimly aware of what went on about him .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 21]: The court-house was finally exhausted by its visitor , who resumed her seat and submitted with beamish grace to praise .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 22]: Then Miss Spence said , in a favourable manner : `` Georgie Bassett , you may read your letter next . ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 29]: The neat Georgie rose , nothing loath , and began : '' ` Dear Teacher -- ' '' There was a slight titter , which Miss Spence suppressed .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 8]: Georgie was not at all discomfited . ''
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 38]: ` My mother says , ' '' he continued , reading his manuscript , '' ` we should treat our teacher as a friend , and so _ I _ will write YOU a letter . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 29]: This penetrated Penrod 's trance , and he lifted his eyes to fix them upon the back of Georgie Bassett 's head in a long and inscrutable stare .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 60]: It was inscrutable , and yet if Georgie had been sensitive to thought waves , it is probable that he would have uttered a loud shriek ; but he remained placidly unaware , continuing : '' ' I thought I would write you about a subject of general interest , and so I will write you about the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 23]: There are many kinds of flowers , spring flowers , and summer flowers , and autumn flowers , but no winter flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 32]: Wild flowers grow in the woods , and it is nice to hunt them in springtime , and we must remember to give some to the poor and hospitals , also .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 15]: Flowers can be made to grow in flower-beds and placed in vases in houses .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 18]: There are many names for flowers , but _ I _ call them `` nature 's ornaments .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 21]: -- ' '' Penrod 's gaze had relaxed , drooped to his button again , and his lethargy was renewed .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 26]: The outer world grew vaguer ; voices seemed to drone at a distance ; sluggish time passed heavily -- but some of it did pass .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 4]: `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 17]: Miss Spence 's searching eye had taken note of the bent head and the twisting button .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 8]: She found it necessary to speak again .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 5]: `` Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 6]: He came languidly to life .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 8]: `` You may read your letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 19]: And he began to paw clumsily among his books , whereupon Miss Spence 's glance fired with suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 7]: `` Have you prepared one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 9]: `` Yes 'm , '' said Penrod dreamily .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 18]: `` But you 're going to find you forgot to bring it , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 21]: `` I got it , '' said Penrod , discovering the paper in his `` Principles of English Composition . ''
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 27]: `` Well , we 'll listen to what you 've found time to prepare , '' she said , adding coldly , `` for once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 53]: The frankest pessimism concerning Penrod permeated the whole room ; even the eyes of those whose letters had not met with favour turned upon him with obvious assurance that here was every prospect of a performance that would , by comparison , lend a measure of credit to the worst preceding it .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 26]: But Penrod was unaffected by the general gaze ; he rose , still blinking from his lethargy , and in no true sense wholly alive .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 45]: He had one idea : to read as rapidly as possible , so as to be done with the task , and he began in a high-pitched monotone , reading with a blind mind and no sense of the significance of the words . ''
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 10]: ` Dear friend , '' ' he declaimed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 76]: ` You call me beautiful , but I am not really beautiful , and there are times when I doubt if I am even pretty , though perhaps my hair is beautiful , and if it is true that my eyes are like blue stars in heaven -- ' '' Simultaneously he lost his breath and there burst upon him a perception of the results to which he was being committed by this calamitous reading .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 23]: And also simultaneous the outbreak of the class into cachinnations of delight , severely repressed by the perplexed but indignant Miss Spence .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 5]: `` Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 10]: she commanded grimly , when she had restored order .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 13]: he gulped , looking wretchedly upon the rosy faces all about him .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 13]: `` Go on with the description of yourself , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 19]: `` We 'd like to hear some more about your eyes being like blue stars in heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 34]: Here many of Penrod 's little comrades were forced to clasp their faces tightly in both hands ; and his dismayed gaze , in refuge , sought the treacherous paper in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 7]: What it beheld there was horrible .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 4]: `` Proceed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 5]: Miss Spence said . ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 45]: ` I -- often think , ' '' he faltered , '' ` and a-a tree-more th-thrills my bein ' when I REcall your last words to me -- that last -- that last -- that -- ' '' `` GO ON ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 37]: ` That last evening in the moonlight when you -- you -- you -- ' '' `` Penrod , '' Miss Spence said dangerously , `` you go on , and stop that stammering . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 26]: ` You -- you said you would wait for -- for years to -- to -- to -- to -- '' `` PENROD ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 7]: ` To win me ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 9]: the miserable Penrod managed to gasp . '' '
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 54]: I should not have pre -- premitted -- permitted you to speak so until we have our -- our parents ' con-consent ; but oh , how sweet it -- ' '' He exhaled a sigh of agony , and then concluded briskly , '' ` Yours respectfully , Penrod Schofield . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 16]: But Miss Spence had at last divined something , for she knew the Schofield family .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 7]: `` Bring me that letter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 15]: And the scarlet boy passed forward between rows of mystified but immoderately uplifted children .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 46]: Miss Spence herself grew rather pink as she examined the missive , and the intensity with which she afterward extended her examination to cover the complete field of Penrod Schofield caused him to find a remote centre of interest whereon to rest his embarrassed gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 47]: She let him stand before her throughout a silence , equalled , perhaps , by the tenser pauses during trials for murder , and then , containing herself , she sweepingly gestured him to the pillory -- a chair upon the platform , facing the school .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 43]: Here he suffered for the unusual term of an hour , with many jocular and cunning eyes constantly upon him ; and , when he was released at noon , horrid shouts and shrieks pursued him every step of his homeward way .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 14]: For his laughter-loving little schoolmates spared him not -- neither boy nor girl .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 6]: `` Yay , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 3]: they shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 8]: `` How 's your beautiful hair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 7]: And , `` Hi , Penrod !
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 12]: When you goin ' to get your parents ' consent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 17]: And , `` Say , blue stars in heaven , how 's your beautiful eyes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 13]: And , `` Say , Penrod , how 's your tree-mores ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 12]: `` Does your tree-mores thrill your bein ' , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 12]: And many other facetious inquiries , hard to bear in public .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 24]: And when he reached the temporary shelter of his home , he experienced no relief upon finding that Margaret was out for lunch .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 37]: He was as deeply embittered toward her as toward any other , and , considering her largely responsible for his misfortune , he would have welcomed an opportunity to show her what he thought of her .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 26]: WEDNESDAY MADNESS How long he was `` kept in '' after school that afternoon is not a matter of record ; but it was long .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 34]: Before he finally appeared upon the street , he had composed an ample letter on a subject of general interest , namely `` School Life '' , under the supervision of Miss Spencer .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 44]: He had also received some scorching admonitions in respect to honourable behaviour regarding other people 's letters ; and Margaret 's had been returned to him with severe instructions to bear it straight to the original owner accompanied by full confession and apology .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 28]: As a measure of insurance that these things be done , Miss Spence stated definitely her intention to hold a conversation by telephone with Margaret that evening .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 30]: Altogether , the day had been unusually awful , even for Wednesday , and Penrod left the school-house with the heart of an anarchist throbbing in his hot bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 40]: It were more accurate , indeed , to liken him to the anarchist 's characteristic weapon ; for as Penrod came out to the street he was , in all inward respects , a bomb , loaded and ticking .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 11]: He walked moodily , with a visible aspect of soreness .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 43]: A murmurous sound was thick about his head , wherefore it is to be surmised that he communed with his familiar , and one vehement , oft-repeated phrase beat like a tocsin of revolt upon the air : `` Daw-gone 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 7]: He meant everybody -- the universe .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 15]: Particularly included , evidently , was a sparrow , offensively cheerful upon a lamp-post .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 40]: This self-centred little bird allowed a pebble to pass overhead and remained unconcerned , but , a moment later , feeling a jar beneath his feet , and hearing the tinkle of falling glass , he decided to leave .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 28]: Similarly , and at the same instant , Penrod made the same decision , and the sparrow in flight took note of a boy likewise in flight .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 22]: The boy disappeared into the nearest alley and emerged therefrom , breathless , in the peaceful vicinity of his own home .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 29]: He entered the house , clumped upstairs and down , discovered Margaret reading a book in the library , and flung the accursed letter toward her with loathing .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 14]: `` You can take the old thing , '' he said bitterly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 9]: _ I _ do n't want it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 15]: And before she was able to reply , he was out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 10]: The next moment he was out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 5]: `` Daw-GONE 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 53]: And then , across the street , his soured eye fell upon his true comrade and best friend leaning against a picket fence and holding desultory converse with Mabel Rorebeck , an attractive member of the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class , that hated organization of which Sam and Penrod were both members .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 22]: Mabel was a shy little girl ; but Penrod had a vague understanding that Sam considered her two brown pig-tails beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 19]: Howbeit , Sam had never told his love ; he was , in fact , sensitive about it .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 45]: This meeting with the lady was by chance , and , although it afforded exquisite moments , his heart was beating in an unaccustomed manner , and he was suffering from embarrassment , being at a loss , also , for subjects of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 61]: It is , indeed , no easy matter to chat easily with a person , however lovely and beloved , who keeps her face turned the other way , maintains one foot in rapid and continuous motion through an arc seemingly perilous to her equilibrium , and confines her responses , both affirmative and negative , to `` Uh-huh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 36]: Altogether , Sam was sufficiently nervous without any help from Penrod , and it was with pure horror that he heard his own name and Mabel 's shrieked upon the ambient air with viperish insinuation .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 5]: `` Sam-my and May-bul !
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 5]: OH , oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 4]: Sam started violently .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 28]: Mabel ceased to swing her foot , and both , encarnadined , looked up and down and everywhere for the invisible but well-known owner of that voice .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 44]: It came again , in taunting mockery : `` Sammy 's mad , and I am glad , And I know what will please him : A bottle o ' wine to make him shine , And Mabel Rorebeck to squeeze him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 6]: `` Fresh ole thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 7]: said Miss Rorebeck , becoming articulate .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 21]: And unreasonably including Sam in her indignation , she tossed her head at him with an unmistakable effect of scorn .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 6]: She began to walk away .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 19]: `` Well , Mabel , '' Sam said plaintively , following , `` it ai n't MY fault .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 8]: _ I _ did n't do anything .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 5]: It 's Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 26]: `` I do n't care , '' she began pettishly , when the viperish voice was again lifted : `` Oh , oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 5]: Who 's your beau ?
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 16]: Guess _ I _ know : Mabel and Sammy , oh , oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 7]: _ I _ caught you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 14]: Then Mabel did one of those things that eternally perplex the slower sex .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 24]: She deliberately made a face , not at the tree behind which Penrod was lurking , but at the innocent and heart-wrung Sam .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 14]: `` You need n't come limpin ' after me , Sam Williams ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 13]: she said , though Sam was approaching upon two perfectly sound legs .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 12]: And then she ran away at the top of her speed .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 8]: `` Run , rigger , run ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 4]: Penrod began inexcusably .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 10]: But Sam cut the persecutions short at this point .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 16]: Stung to fury , he charged upon the sheltering tree in the Schofields ' yard .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 28]: Ordinarily , at such a juncture , Penrod would have fled , keeping his own temper and increasing the heat of his pursuer 's by back-flung jeers .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 16]: But this was Wednesday , and he was in no mood to run from Sam .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 11]: He stepped away from the tree , awaiting the onset .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 13]: `` Well , what you goin ' to do so much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 11]: Sam did not pause to proffer the desired information . ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 8]: ` Tcha got ` ny SENSE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 26]: was the total extent of his vocal preliminaries before flinging himself headlong upon the taunter ; and the two boys went to the ground together .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 14]: Embracing , they rolled , they pommelled , they hammered , they kicked .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 7]: Alas , this was a fight .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 27]: They rose , flailing a while , then renewed their embrace , and , grunting , bestowed themselves anew upon our ever too receptive Mother Earth .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 30]: Once more upon their feet , they beset each other sorely , dealing many great blows , ofttimes upon the air , but with sufficient frequency upon resentful flesh .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 16]: Tears were jolted to the rims of eyes , but technically they did not weep .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 23]: `` Got ` ny sense , '' was repeated chokingly many , many times ; also , `` Dern ole fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 9]: and , `` I 'll SHOW you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 14]: The peacemaker who appeared upon the animated scene was Penrod 's great-uncle Slocum .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 43]: This elderly relative had come to call upon Mrs. Schofield , and he was well upon his way to the front door when the mutterings of war among some shrubberies near the fence caused him to deflect his course in benevolent agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 3]: `` Boys !
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 2]: Boys !
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 5]: Shame , boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 36]: he said ; but , as the originality of these expressions did not prove striking enough to attract any great attention from the combatants , he felt obliged to assume a share in the proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 37]: It was a share entailing greater activity than he had anticipated , and , before he managed to separate the former friends , he intercepted bodily an amount of violence to which he was wholly unaccustomed .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 25]: Additionally , his attire was disarranged ; his hat was no longer upon his head , and his temper was in a bad way .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 37]: In fact , as his hat flew off , he made use of words that under less extreme circumstances would have caused both boys to feel a much profounder interest than they did in great-uncle Slocum .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 7]: `` I 'll GET you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 3]: Sam babbled .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 33]: `` Do n't you ever dare to speak to me again , Penrod Schofield , long as you live , or I 'll whip you worse 'n I have this time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 3]: Penrod squawked .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 39]: For the moment he was incapable of coherent speech , and then , failing in a convulsive attempt to reach his enemy , his fury culminated upon an innocent object that had never done him the slightest harm .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 38]: Great-uncle Slocum 's hat lay upon the ground close by , and Penrod was in the state of irritation that seeks an outlet too blindly -- as people say , he `` HAD to do SOMETHING ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 33]: He kicked great-uncle Slocum 's hat with such sweep and precision that it rose swiftly , and , breasting the autumn breeze , passed over the fence and out into the street .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 30]: Great-uncle Slocum uttered a scream of anguish , and , immediately ceasing to peacemake , ran forth to a more important rescue ; but the conflict was not renewed .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 34]: Sanity had returned to Sam Williams ; he was awed by this colossal deed of Penrod 's and filled with horror at the thaught that he might be held as accessory to it .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 25]: Fleetly he fled , pursued as far as the gate by the whole body of Penrod , and thereafter by Penrod 's voice alone .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 5]: `` You BETTER run !
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 7]: You wait till I catch you !
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 9]: You 'll see what you get next time !
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 33]: Do n't you ever speak to me again as long as you -- '' Here he paused abruptly , for great-uncle Slocum had recovered his hat and was returning toward the gate .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 33]: After one glance at great-uncle Slocum , Penrod did not linger to attempt any explanation -- there are times when even a boy can see that apologies would seem out of place .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 9]: Penrod ran round the house to the backyard .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 8]: Here he was enthusiastically greeted by Duke .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 8]: `` You get away from me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 32]: Penrod said hoarsely , and with terrible gestures he repulsed the faithful animal , who retired philosophically to the stable , while his master let himself out of the back gate .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 13]: Penrod had decided to absent himself from home for the time being .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 34]: The sky was gray , and there were hints of coming dusk in the air ; it was an hour suited to his turbulent soul , and he walked with a sombre swagger .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 9]: `` Ran like a c ` ardy-calf ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 16]: he sniffed , half aloud , alluding to the haste of Sam Williams in departure .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 11]: `` All he is , ole c ` ardy-calf ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 21]: Then , as he proceeded up the alley , a hated cry smote his ears : `` Hi , Penrod !
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 6]: How 's your tree-mores ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 12]: And two jovial schoolboy faces appeared above a high board fence .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 10]: `` How 's your beautiful hair , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 3]: they vociferated .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 12]: `` When you goin ' to git your parents ' consent ?
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 14]: What makes you think you 're only pretty , ole blue stars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 35]: Penrod looked about feverishly for a missile , and could find none to his hand , but the surface of the alley sufficed ; he made mud balls and fiercely bombarded the vociferous fence .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 44]: Naturally , hostile mud balls presently issued from behind this barricade ; and thus a campaign developed that offered a picture not unlike a cartoonist 's sketch of a political campaign , wherein this same material is used for the decoration of opponents .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 22]: But Penrod had been unwise ; he was outnumbered , and the hostile forces held the advantageous side of the fence .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 32]: Mud balls can be hard as well as soggy ; some of those that reached Penrod were of no inconsiderable weight and substance , and they made him grunt despite himself .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 39]: Finally , one , at close range , struck him in the pit of the stomach , whereupon he clasped himself about the middle silently , and executed some steps in seeming imitation of a quaint Indian dance .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 19]: His plight being observed through a knothole , his enemies climbed upon the fence and regarded him seriously .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 16]: `` Aw , YOU 'RE all right , ai n't you , old tree-mores ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 3]: inquired one .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 7]: `` I 'll SHOW you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 45]: bellowed Penrod , recovering his breath ; and he hurled a fat ball -- thoughtfully retained in hand throughout his agony -- to such effect that his interrogator disappeared backward from the fence without having taken any initiative of his own in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 14]: His comrade impulsively joined him upon the ground , and the battle continued .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 8]: Through the gathering dusk it went on .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 23]: It waged but the hotter as darkness made aim more difficult -- and still Penrod would not be driven from the field .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 30]: Panting , grunting , hoarse from returning insults , fighting on and on , an indistinguishable figure in the gloom , he held the back alley against all comers .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 38]: For such a combat darkness has one great advantage ; but it has an equally important disadvantage -- the combatant can not see to aim ; on the other hand , he can not see to dodge .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 11]: And all the while Penrod was receiving two for one .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 6]: He became heavy with mud .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 20]: Plastered , impressionistic and sculpturesque , there was about him a quality of the tragic , of the magnificent .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 8]: He resembled a sombre masterpiece by Rodin .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 13]: No one could have been quite sure what he was meant for .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 6]: Dinner bells tinkled in houses .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 8]: Then they were rung from kitchen doors .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 16]: Calling voices came urging from the distance , calling boys ' names into the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 13]: They called and a note of irritation seemed to mar their beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 18]: Then bells were rung again -- and the voices renewed appeals more urgent , much more irritated .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 7]: They called and called and called .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 2]: THUD !
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 5]: went the mud balls .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 2]: Thud !
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 2]: Thud !
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 2]: Blunk !
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 4]: `` OOF ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 3]: said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 47]: ... Sam Williams , having dined with his family at their usual hour , seven , slipped unostentatiously out of the kitchen door , as soon as he could , after the conclusion of the meal , and quietly betook himself to the Schofields ' corner .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 19]: Here he stationed himself where he could see all avenues of approach to the house , and waited .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 29]: Twenty minutes went by , and then Sam became suddenly alert and attentive , for the arc-light revealed a small , grotesque figure slowly approaching along the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 26]: It was brown in colour , shaggy and indefinite in form ; it limped excessively , and paused to rub itself , and to meditate .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 15]: Peculiar as the thing was , Sam had no doubt as to its identity .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 4]: He advanced . ''
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 17]: ` Lo , Penrod , '' he said cautiously , and with a shade of formality .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 32]: Penrod leaned against the fence , and , lifting one leg , tested the knee-joint by swinging his foot back and forth , a process evidently provocative of a little pain .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 55]: Then he rubbed the left side of his encrusted face , and , opening his mouth to its whole capacity as an aperture , moved his lower jaw slightly from side to side , thus triumphantly settling a question in his own mind as to whether or no a suspected dislocation had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 35]: Having satisfied himself on these points , he examined both shins delicately by the sense of touch , and carefully tested the capacities of his neck-muscles to move his head in a wonted manner .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 11]: Then he responded somewhat gruffly : '' ` Lo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 6]: `` Where you been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 8]: Sam said eagerly , his formality vanishing .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 7]: `` Havin ' a mud-fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 7]: `` I guess you did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 8]: Sam exclaimed , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 17]: `` What you goin ' to tell your -- '' `` Oh , nothin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 20]: `` Your sister telephoned to our house to see if I knew where you were , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 25]: `` She told me if I saw you before you got home to tell you sumpthing ; but not to say anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 52]: She said Miss Spence had telephoned to her , but she said for me to tell you it was all right about that letter , and she was n't goin ' to tell your mother and father on you , so you need n't say anything about it to 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 9]: `` All right , '' said Penrod indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 20]: `` She says you 're goin ' to be in enough trouble without that , '' Sam went on .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 18]: `` You 're goin ' to catch fits about your Uncle Slocum 's hat , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 10]: `` Well , I guess I know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 12]: `` And about not comin ' home to dinner , too .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 21]: Your mother telephoned twice to Mamma while we were eatin ' to see if you 'd come in our house .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 21]: And when they SEE you -- MY , but you 're goin ' to get the DICKENS , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 18]: Penrod seemed unimpressed , though he was well aware that Sam 's prophecy was no unreasonable one .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 14]: `` Well , I guess I know it , '' he repeated casually .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 9]: And he moved slowly toward his own gate .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 35]: His friend looked after him curiously -- then , as the limping figure fumbled clumsily with bruised fingers at the latch of the gate , there sounded a little solicitude in Sam 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 13]: `` Say , Penrod , how -- how do you feel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 8]: `` Do you feel pretty bad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 27]: `` No , '' said Penrod , and , in spite of what awaited him beyond the lighted portals just ahead , he spoke the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 12]: His nerves were rested , and his soul was at peace .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 6]: His Wednesday madness was over .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 13]: `` No , '' said Penrod ; `` I feel bully ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 37]: PENROD 'S BUSY DAY Although the pressure had thus been relieved and Penrod found peace with himself , nevertheless there were times during the rest of that week when he felt a strong distaste for Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 57]: His schoolmates frequently reminded him of such phrases in her letter as they seemed least able to forget , and for hours after each of these experiences he was unable to comport himself with human courtesy when constrained -LRB- as at dinner -RRB- to remain for any length of time in the same room with her .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 41]: But by Sunday these moods had seemed to pass ; he attended church in her close company , and had no thought of the troubles brought upon him by her correspondence with a person who throughout remained unknown to him .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 48]: Penrod slumped far down in the pew with his knees against the back of that in front , and he also languished to one side , so that the people sitting behind were afforded a view of him consisting of a little hair and one bored ear .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 59]: The sermon -- a noble one , searching and eloquent -- was but a persistent sound in that ear , though , now and then , Penrod 's attention would be caught by some detached portion of a sentence , when his mind would dwell dully upon the phrases for a little while and lapse into a torpor .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 47]: At intervals his mother , without turning her head , would whisper , `` Sit up , Penrod , '' causing him to sigh profoundly and move his shoulders about an inch , this mere gesture of compliance exhausting all the energy that remained to him .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 30]: The black backs and gray heads of the elderly men in the congregation oppressed him ; they made him lethargic with a sense of long lives of repellent dullness .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 17]: But he should have been grateful to the lady with the artificial cherries upon her hat .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 31]: His gaze lingered there , wandered away , and hopelessly returned again and again , to be a little refreshed by the glossy scarlet of the cluster of tiny globes .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 42]: He was not so fortunate as to be drowsy ; that would have brought him some relief -- and yet , after a while , his eyes became slightly glazed ; he saw dimly , and what he saw was distorted .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 22]: The church had been built in the early ` Seventies , and it contained some naive stained glass of that period .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 17]: The arch at the top of a window facing Penrod was filled with a gigantic Eye .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 45]: Of oyster-white and raw blues and reds , inflamed by the pouring sun , it had held an awful place in the infantile life of Penrod Schofield , for in his tenderer years he accepted it without question as the literal Eye of Deity .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 18]: He had been informed that the church was the divine dwelling -- and there was the Eye !
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 51]: Nowadays , being no longer a little child , he had somehow come to know better without being told , and , though the great flaming Eye was no longer the terrifying thing it had been to him during his childhood , it nevertheless retained something of its ominous character .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 25]: It made him feel spied upon , and its awful glare still pursued him , sometimes , as he was falling asleep at night .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 13]: When he faced the window his feeling was one of dull resentment .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 27]: His own glazed eyes , becoming slightly crossed with an ennui that was peculiarly intense this morning , rendered the Eye more monstrous than it was .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 37]: It expanded to horrible size , growing mountainous ; it turned into a volcano in the tropics , and yet it stared at him , indubitably an Eye implacably hostile to all rights of privacy forever .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 23]: Penrod blinked and clinched his eyelids to be rid of this dual image , and he managed to shake off the volcano .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 21]: Then , lowering the angle of his glance , he saw something most remarkable -- and curiously out of place .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 35]: An inverted white soup-plate was lying miraculously balanced upon the back of a pew a little distance in front of him , and upon the upturned bottom of the soup-plate was a brown cocoanut .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 21]: Mildly surprised , Penrod yawned , and , in the effort to straighten his eyes , came to life temporarily .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 19]: The cocoanut was revealed as Georgie Bassett 's head , and the soup-plate as Georgie 's white collar .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 21]: Georgie was sitting up straight , as he always did in church , and Penrod found this vertical rectitude unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 41]: He knew that he had more to fear from the Eye than Georgie had , and he was under the impression -LRB- a correct one -RRB- that Georgie felt on intimate terms with it and was actually fond of it .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 18]: Penrod himself would have maintained that he was fond of it , if he had been asked .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 26]: He would have said so because he feared to say otherwise ; and the truth is that he never consciously looked at the Eye disrespectfully .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 23]: He would have been alarmed if he thought the Eye had any way of finding out how he really felt about it .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 13]: When not off his guard , he always looked at it placatively .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 36]: By and by , he sagged so far to the left that he had symptoms of a `` stitch in the side '' , and , rousing himself , sat partially straight for several moments .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 31]: Then he rubbed his shoulders slowly from side to side against the back of the seat , until his mother whispered , `` Do n't do that , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 30]: Upon this , he allowed himself to slump inwardly till the curve in the back of his neck rested against the curved top of the back of the seat .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 23]: It was a congenial fit , and Penrod again began to move slowly from side to side , finding the friction soothing .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 17]: Even so slight a pleasure was denied him by a husky , `` Stop that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 4]: from his father .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 8]: Penrod sighed , and slid farther down .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 33]: He scratched his head , his left knee , his right biceps and his left ankle , after which he scratched his right knee , his right ankle and his left biceps .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 10]: Then he said , `` Oh , hum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 27]: unconsciously , but so loudly that there was a reproving stir in the neighbourhood of the Schofield pew , and his father looked at him angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 9]: Finally , his nose began to trouble him .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 13]: It itched , and after scratching it , he rubbed it harshly .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 6]: Another `` Stop that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 21]: from his father proved of no avail , being greeted by a desperate-sounding whisper , `` I GOT to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 22]: And , continuing to rub his nose with his right hand , Penrod began to search his pockets with his left .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 19]: The quest proving fruitless , he rubbed his nose with his left hand and searched with his right .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 21]: Then he abandoned his nose and searched feverishly with both hands , going through all of his pockets several times .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 7]: `` What DO you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 4]: whispered his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 15]: But Margaret had divined his need , and she passed him her own handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 53]: This was both thoughtful and thoughtless -- the latter because Margaret was in the habit of thinking that she became faint in crowds , especially at the theatre or in church , and she had just soaked her handkerchief with spirits of ammonia from a small phial she carried in her muff .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 14]: Penrod hastily applied the handkerchief to his nose and even more hastily exploded .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 55]: He sneezed stupendously ; he choked , sneezed again , wept , passed into a light convulsion of coughing and sneezing together -- a mergence of sound that attracted much attention -- and , after a few recurrent spasms , convalesced into a condition marked by silent tears and only sporadic instances of sneezing .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 39]: By this time his family were unanimously scarlet -- his father and mother with mortification , and Margaret with the effort to control the almost irresistible mirth that the struggles and vociferations of Penrod had inspired within her .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 56]: And yet her heart misgave her , for his bloodshot and tearful eyes were fixed upon her from the first and remained upon her , even when half-blinded with his agony ; and their expression -- as terrible as that of the windowed Eye confronting her -- was not for an instant to be misunderstood .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 37]: Absolutely , he believed that she had handed him the ammonia-soaked handkerchief deliberately and with malice , and well she knew that no power on earth could now or at any time henceforth persuade him otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 24]: `` Of course I did n't mean it , Penrod , '' she said , at the first opportunity upon their homeward way .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 36]: `` I did n't notice -- that is , I did n't think -- '' Unfortunately for the effect of sincerity she hoped to produce , her voice became tremulous and her shoulders moved suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 5]: `` Just you wait !
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 5]: You 'll see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 17]: he prophesied , in a voice now choking , not with ammonia , but with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 13]: `` Poison a person , and then laugh in his face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 24]: He spake no more until they had reached their own house , though she made some further futile efforts at explanation and apology .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 38]: And after brooding abysmally throughout the meal that followed , he disappeared from the sight of his family , having answered with one frightful look his mother 's timid suggestion that it was almost time for Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 30]: He retired to his eyry -- the sawdust box in the empty stable -- and there gave rein to his embittered imaginings , incidentally forming many plans for Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 35]: Most of these were much too elaborate ; but one was so alluring that he dwelt upon it , working out the details with gloomy pleasure , even after he had perceived its defects .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 24]: It involved some postponement -- in fact , until Margaret should have become the mother of a boy about Penrod 's present age .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 28]: This boy would be precisely like Georgie Bassett -- Penrod conceived that as inevitable -- and , like Georgie , he would be his mother 's idol .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 29]: Penrod meant to take him to church and force him to blow his nose with an ammonia-soaked handkerchief in the presence of the Eye and all the congregation .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 39]: Then Penrod intended to say to this boy , after church , `` Well , that 's exackly what your mother did to me , and if you do n't like it , you better look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 12]: And the real Penrod in the sawdust box clenched his fists .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 7]: `` Come ahead , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 7]: `` You talk too much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 29]: Whereupon , the Penrod of his dream gave Margaret 's puny son a contemptuous thrashing under the eyes of his mother , who besought in vain for mercy .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 25]: This plan was finally dropped , not because of any lingering nepotism within Penrod , but because his injury called for action less belated .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 34]: One after another , he thought of impossible things ; one after another , he thought of things merely inane and futile , for he was trying to do something beyond his power .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 13]: Penrod was never brilliant , or even successful , save by inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 34]: At four o'clock he came into the house , still nebulous , and as he passed the open door of the library he heard a man 's voice , not his father 's .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 58]: `` To me , '' said this voice , `` the finest lines in all literature are those in Tennyson 's ` Maud ' -- '' ` Had it lain for a century dead , My dust would hear her and beat , And blossom in purple and red , There somewhere around near her feet . '
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 55]: `` I think I have quoted correctly , '' continued the voice nervously , `` but , at any rate , what I wished to -- ah -- say was that I often think of those ah -- words ; but I never think of them without thinking of -- of -- of YOU .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 23]: I -- ah -- '' The nervous voice paused , and Penrod took an oblique survey of the room , himself unobserved .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 28]: Margaret was seated in an easy chair and her face was turned away from Penrod , so that her expression of the moment remained unknown to him .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 63]: Facing her , and leaning toward her with perceptible emotion , was Mr. Claude Blakely -- a young man with whom Penrod had no acquaintance , though he had seen him , was aware of his identity , and had heard speech between Mrs. Schofield and Margaret which indicated that Mr. Blakely had formed the habit of calling frequently at the house .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 36]: This was a brilliantly handsome young man ; indeed , his face was so beautiful that even Penrod was able to perceive something about it which might be explicably pleasing -- at least to women .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 41]: And Penrod remembered that , on the last evening before Mr. Robert Williams 's departure for college , Margaret had been peevish because Penrod had genially spent the greater portion of the evening with Robert and herself upon the porch .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 57]: Margaret made it clear , later , that she strongly preferred to conduct her conversations with friends unassisted -- and as Penrod listened to the faltering words of Mr. Claude Blakely , he felt instinctively that , in a certain contingency , Margaret 's indignation would be even more severe to-day than on the former occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 10]: Mr. Blakely coughed faintly and was able to continue .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 63]: `` I mean to say that when I say that what Tennyson says -- ah -- seems to -- to apply to -- to a feeling about you -- '' At this point , finding too little breath in himself to proceed , in spite of the fact that he had spoken in an almost inaudible tone , Mr. Blakely stopped again .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 13]: Something about this little scene was making a deep impression upon Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 54]: What that impression was , he could not possibly have stated ; but he had a sense of the imminence of a tender crisis , and he perceived that the piquancy of affairs in the library had reached a point which would brand an intentional interruption as the act of a cold-blooded ruffian .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 47]: Suddenly it was as though a strong light shone upon him : he decided that it was Mr. Blakely who had told Margaret that her eyes were like blue stars in heaven -- THIS was the person who had caused the hateful letter to be written !
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 15]: That decided Penrod ; his inspiration , so long waited for , had come .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 28]: `` I -- I feel that perhaps I am not plain , '' said Mr. Blakely , and immediately became red , whereas he had been pale .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 21]: He was at least modest enough about his looks to fear that Margaret might think he had referred to them .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 40]: `` I mean , not plain in another sense -- that is , I mean not that _ I _ am not plain in saying what I mean to you -- I mean , what you mean to ME !
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 12]: I feel -- '' This was the moment selected by Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 26]: He walked carelessly into the library , inquiring in a loud , bluff voice : `` Has anybody seen my dog around here anywheres ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 42]: Mr. Blakely had inclined himself so far toward Margaret , and he was sitting so near the edge of the chair , that only a really wonderful bit of instinctive gymnastics landed him upon his feet instead of upon his back .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 12]: As for Margaret , she said , `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 5]: and regarded Penrod blankly .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 26]: `` Well , '' said Penrod breezily , `` I guess it 's no use lookin ' for him -- he is n't anywheres around .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 8]: I guess I 'll sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 30]: Herewith , he sank into an easy chair , and remarked , as in comfortable explanation , `` I 'm kind of tired standin ' up , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 15]: Even in this crisis , Margaret was a credit to her mother 's training .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 10]: `` Penrod , have you met Mr. Blakely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 6]: Margaret primly performed the rite .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 12]: `` Mr. Blakely , this is my little brother Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 13]: Mr. Blakely was understood to murmur , `` How d'ye do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 9]: `` I 'm well , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 38]: Margaret bent a perplexed gaze upon him , and he saw that she had not divined his intentions , though the expression of Mr. Blakely was already beginning to be a little compensation for the ammonia outrage .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 28]: Then , as the protracted silence which followed the introduction began to be a severe strain upon all parties , Penrod felt called upon to relieve it .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 18]: `` I did n't have anything much to do this afternoon , anyway , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 17]: And at that there leaped a spark in Margaret 's eye ; her expression became severe .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 14]: `` You should have gone to Sunday-school , '' she told him crisply .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 8]: `` Well , I did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 36]: said Penrod , with a bitterness so significant of sufferings connected with religion , ammonia , and herself , that Margaret , after giving him a thoughtful look , concluded not to urge the point .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 5]: Mr. Blakely smiled pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 32]: `` I was looking out of the window a minute ago , '' he said , `` and I saw a dog run across the street and turn the corner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 12]: `` What kind of a lookin ' dog was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 6]: Penrod inquired , with languor .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 20]: `` Well , '' said Mr. Blakely , `` it was a -- it was a nice-looking dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 7]: `` What colour was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 8]: `` He was -- ah -- white .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 17]: That is , I think -- '' `` It was n't Duke , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 8]: `` Duke 's kind of brownish-gray-like . ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 4]: Mr. Blakely brightened .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 11]: `` Yes , that was it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 17]: `` This dog I saw first had another dog with him -- a brownish-gray dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 6]: `` Little or big ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 6]: Penrod asked , without interest .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 10]: `` Why , Duke 's a little dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 3]: Margaret intervened .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 16]: `` Of COURSE , if it was little , it must have been Duke . ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 12]: `` It WAS little , '' said Mr. Blakely too enthusiastically .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 10]: `` It was a little bit of a dog .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 10]: I noticed it because it was so little . ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 15]: `` Could n't ` a ' been Duke , then , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 11]: `` Duke 's a kind of a middle-sized dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 14]: He yawned , and added : `` I do n't want him now .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 12]: I want to stay in the house this afternoon , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 15]: And it 's better for Duke to be out in the fresh air . ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 13]: Mr. Blakely coughed again and sat down , finding little to say .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 23]: It was evident , also , that Margaret shared his perplexity ; and another silence became so embarrassing that Penrod broke it .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 21]: `` I was out in the sawdust-box , '' he said , `` but it got kind of chilly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 31]: Neither of his auditors felt called upon to offer any comment , and presently he added , `` I thought I better come in here where it 's warmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 14]: `` It 's too warm , '' ' said Margaret , at once .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 12]: `` Mr. Blakely , would you mind opening a window ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 6]: `` By all means ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 10]: the young man responded earnestly , as he rose .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 9]: `` Maybe I 'd better open two ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' said Margaret ; `` that would be much better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 17]: But Penrod watched Mr. Blakely open two windows to their widest , and betrayed no anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 27]: His remarks upon the relative temperatures of the sawdust-box and the library had been made merely for the sake of creating sound in a silent place .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 34]: When the windows had been open for several minutes , Penrod 's placidity , though gloomy , denoted anything but discomfort from the draft , which was powerful , the day being windy .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 21]: It was Mr. Blakely 's turn to break a silence , and he did it so unexpectedly that Margaret started .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 3]: He sneezed .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 11]: `` Perhaps -- '' Margaret began , but paused apprehensively .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 36]: `` Perhaps-per-per -- '' Her apprehensions became more and more poignant ; her eyes seemed fixed upon some incredible disaster ; she appeared to inflate while the catastrophe she foresaw became more and more imminent .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 27]: All at once she collapsed , but the power decorum had over her was attested by the mildness of her sneeze after so threatening a prelude .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 17]: `` Perhaps I 'd better put one of the windows down , '' Mr. Blakely suggested .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 10]: `` Both , I believe , '' said Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 13]: `` The room has cooled off , now , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 28]: Mr. Blakely closed the windows , and , returning to a chair near Margaret , did his share in the production of another long period of quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 14]: Penrod allowed this one to pass without any vocal disturbance on his part .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 30]: It may be , however , that his gaze was disturbing to Mr. Blakely , upon whose person it was glassily fixed with a self-forgetfulness that was almost morbid .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 14]: `` Did n't you enjoy the last meeting of the Cotillion Club ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 4]: Margaret said finally .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 18]: And upon Mr. Blakely 's answering absently in the affirmative , she suddenly began to be talkative .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 29]: He seemed to catch a meaning in her fluency , and followed her lead , a conversation ensuing which at first had all the outward signs of eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 58]: They talked with warm interest of people and events unknown to Penrod ; they laughed enthusiastically about things beyond his ken ; they appeared to have arranged a perfect way to enjoy themselves , no matter whether he was with them or elsewhere but presently their briskness began to slacken ; the appearance of interest became perfunctory .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 30]: Within ten minutes the few last scattering semblances of gayety had passed , and they lapsed into the longest and most profound of all their silences indoors that day .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 16]: Its effect upon Penrod was to make him yawn and settle himself in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 25]: Then Mr. Blakely , coming to the surface out of deep inward communings , snapped his finger against the palm of his hand impulsively .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 7]: he exclaimed , under his breath .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 3]: Margaret asked .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 7]: `` Did you remember something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 11]: `` No , it 's nothing , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 5]: `` Nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 19]: But , by the way , it seems a pity for you to be missing the fine weather .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 14]: I wonder if I could persuade you to take a little walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 15]: Margaret , somewhat to the surprise of both the gentlemen present , looked uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 9]: Mr. Blakely saw that she missed his point .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 15]: `` One can talk better in the open , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 10]: he urged , with a significant glance toward Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 7]: Margaret also glanced keenly at Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 6]: `` Well , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 14]: And then , `` I 'll get my hat , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 11]: Penrod was on his feet before she left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 4]: He stretched himself .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 12]: `` I 'll get mine , too , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 51]: But he carefully went to find it in a direction different from that taken by his sister , and he joined her and her escort not till they were at the front door , whither Mr. Blakely -- with a last flickering of hope had urged a flight in haste .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 19]: `` I been thinkin ' of takin ' a walk , all afternoon , '' said Penrod pompously .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 12]: `` Do n't matter to me which way we go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 43]: The exquisite oval of Mr. Claude Blakely 's face merged into outlines more rugged than usual ; the conformation of his jaw became perceptible , and it could be seen that he had conceived an idea which was crystallizing into a determination .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 47]: `` I believe it happens that this is our first walk together , '' he said to Margaret , as they reached the pavement , `` but , from the kind of tennis you play , I judge that you could go a pretty good gait .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 7]: Do you like walking fast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 3]: She nodded .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 5]: `` For exercise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 8]: `` Shall we try it then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 10]: `` You set the pace , '' said Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 9]: `` I think I can keep up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 52]: He took her at her word , and the amazing briskness of their start seemed a little sinister to Penrod , though he was convinced that he could do anything that Margaret could do , and also that neither she nor her comely friend could sustain such a speed for long .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 15]: On the contrary , they actually increased it with each fleeting block they covered .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 16]: he panted , when they had thus put something more than a half-mile behind them .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 14]: `` There is n't anybody has to have a doctor , I guess !
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 11]: What 's the use our walkin ' so fast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 27]: In truth , Penrod was not walking , for his shorter legs permitted no actual walking at such a speed ; his gait was a half-trot .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 11]: `` Oh , WE 'RE out for a WALK ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 15]: Mr. Blakely returned , a note of gayety beginning to sound in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 18]: `` Marg -- ah -- Miss Schofield , keep your head up and breathe through your nose .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 4]: That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 10]: You 'll find I was right in suggesting this .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 8]: It 's going to turn out gloriously !
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 11]: Now , let 's make it a little faster . ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 17]: Margaret murmured inarticulately , for she would not waste her breath in a more coherent reply .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 27]: Her cheeks were flushed ; her eyes were brimming with the wind , but when she looked at Penrod , they were brimming with something more .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 6]: Gurgling sounds came from her .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 7]: Penrod 's expression had become grim .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 27]: He offered no second protest , mainly because he , likewise , would not waste his breath , and if he would , he could not .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 15]: Of breath in the ordinary sense breath , breathed automatically -- he had none .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 38]: He had only gasps to feed his straining lungs , and his half-trot , which had long since become a trot , was changed for a lope when Mr. Blakely reached his own best burst of speed .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 9]: And now people stared at the flying three .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 27]: The gait of Margaret and Mr. Blakely could be called a walk only by courtesy , while Penrod 's was becoming a kind of blind scamper .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 14]: At times he zigzagged ; other times , he fell behind , wabbling .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 37]: Anon , with elbows flopping and his face sculptured like an antique mask , he would actually forge ahead , and then carom from one to the other of his companions as he fell back again .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 21]: Thus the trio sped through the coming of autumn dusk , outflying the fallen leaves that tumbled upon the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 13]: And still Penrod held to the task that he had set himself .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 26]: The street lamps flickered into life , but on and on Claude Blakely led the lady , and on and on reeled the grim Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 21]: Never once was he so far from them that they could have exchanged a word unchaperoned by his throbbing ear .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 4]: `` OH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 20]: Margaret cried , and , halting suddenly , she draped herself about a lamp-post like a strip of bunting .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 4]: `` Guh-uh-guh-GOODNESS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 20]: Penrod immediately drooped to the curb-stone , which he reached , by pure fortune , in a sitting position .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 17]: Mr. Blakely leaned against a fence , and said nothing , though his breathing was eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 14]: `` We -- we must go -- go home , '' Margaret gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 13]: `` We must , if -- if we can drag ourselves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 13]: Then Penrod showed them what mettle they he 'd tried to crack .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 18]: A paroxysm of coughing shook him ; he spoke through it sobbingly : '' ` Drag ! '
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 7]: 'S jus ' lul-like a girl !
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 6]: Ha-why I walk -- OOF !
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 15]: -- faster 'n that every day -- on my -- way to school . ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 9]: He managed to subjugate a tendency to nausea .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 12]: `` What you -- want to go -- home for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 7]: `` Le 's go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 19]: In the darkness Mr. Claude Blakely 's expression could not be seen , nor was his voice heard .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 15]: For these and other reasons , his opinions and sentiments may not be stated .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 27]: ... Mrs. Schofield was looking rather anxiously forth from her front door when the two adult figures and the faithful smaller one came up the walk .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 10]: `` I was getting uneasy , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 12]: `` Papa and I came in and found the house empty .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 5]: It 's after seven .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 10]: Oh , Mr. Blakely , is that you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 7]: `` Good-evening , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 10]: `` I fear I must be keeping an engagement .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 2]: Good-night .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 6]: Good-night , Miss Schofield . ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 4]: `` Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 13]: `` Well , good-night , '' Penrod called , staring after him .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 26]: But Mr. Blakely was already too far away to hear him , and a moment later Penrod followed his mother and sister into the house .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 15]: `` I let Della go to church , '' Mrs. Schofield said to Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 11]: `` You and I might help Katie get supper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 16]: `` Not for a few minutes , '' Margaret returned gravely , looking at Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 14]: `` Come upstairs , mamma ; I want to tell you something . ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 7]: Penrod cackled hoarse triumph and defiance .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 4]: `` Go on !
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 2]: Tell !
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 7]: What _ ` I _ care ?
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 25]: You try to poison a person in church again , and then laugh in his face , you 'll see what you get ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 35]: But after his mother had retired with Margaret to the latter 's room , he began to feel disturbed in spite of his firm belief that his cause was wholly that of justice victorious .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 36]: Margaret had insidious ways of stating a case ; and her point of view , no matter how absurd or unjust , was almost always adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Schofield in cases of controversy .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 4]: Penrod became uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 15]: Perceiving himself to be in danger , he decided that certain measures were warranted .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 36]: Unquestionably , it would be well to know beforehand in what terms Margaret would couch the charges which he supposed he must face in open court -- that is to say , at the supper-table .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 27]: He stole softly up the stairs , and , flattening himself against the wall , approached Margaret 's door , which was about an inch ajar .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 16]: He heard his mother making sounds which appalled him -- he took them for sobs .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 14]: And then Margaret 's voice rang out in a peal of insane laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 8]: Trembling , he crept nearer the door .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 19]: Within the room Margaret was clinging to her mother , and both were trying to control their hilarity .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 10]: `` He did it all to get even ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 7]: Margaret exclaimed , wiping her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 10]: `` He came in at just the right time .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 38]: That GOOSE was beginning to talk his silly , soft talk -- the way he does with every girl in town -- and he was almost proposing , and I did n't know how to stop him .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 11]: And then Penrod came in and did it for me .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 12]: I could have hugged Penrod , mamma , I actually could !
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 32]: And I saw he meant to stay to get even for that ammonia -- and , oh , I worked so hard to make him think I wanted him to GO !
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 12]: Mamma , mamma , if you could have SEEN that walk !
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 33]: That GOOSE kept thinking he could wear Penrod out or drop him behind , but I knew he could n't so long as Penrod believed he was worrying us and getting even .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 43]: And that GOOSE thought I WANTED to get rid of Penrod , too ; and the conceited thing said it would turn out ` gloriously , ' meaning we 'd be alone together pretty soon -- I 'd like to shake him !
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 24]: You see , I pretended so well , in order to make Penrod stick to us , that GOOSE believed I meant it !
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 70]: And if he had n't tried to walk Penrod off his legs , he would n't have wilted his own collar and worn himself out , and I think he 'd have hung on until you 'd have had to invite him to stay to supper , and he 'd have stayed on all evening , and I would n't have had a chance to write to Robert Williams .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 39]: Mamma , there have been lots of times when I have n't been thankful for Penrod , but to-day I could have got down on my knees to you and papa for giving me such a brother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 63]: In the darkness of the hall , as a small but crushed and broken form stole away from the crack in the door , a gigantic Eye seemed to form -- seemed to glare down upon Penrod -- warning him that the way of vengeance is the way of bafflement , and that genius may not prevail against the trickeries of women .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 9]: `` This has been a NICE day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 4]: Penrod muttered hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 28]: ON ACCOUNT OF THE WEATHER There is no boredom -LRB- not even an invalid 's -RRB- comparable to that of a boy who has nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 23]: When a man says he has nothing to do , he speaks idly ; there is always more than he can do .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 30]: Grown women never say they have nothing to do , and when girls or little girls say they have nothing to do , they are merely airing an affectation .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 34]: But when a boy has nothing to do , he has actually nothing at all to do ; his state is pathetic , and when he complains of it his voice is haunting .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 38]: Mrs. Schofield was troubled by this uncomfortable quality in the voice of her son , who came to her thrice , in his search for entertainment or even employment , one Saturday afternoon during the February thaw .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 19]: Few facts are better established than that the February thaw is the poorest time of year for everybody .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 14]: But for a boy it is worse than poorest ; it is bankrupt .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 34]: The remnant streaks of old soot-speckled snow left against the north walls of houses have no power to inspire ; rather , they are dreary reminders of sports long since carried to satiety .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 27]: One cares little even to eat such snow , and the eating of icicles , also , has come to be a flaccid and stale diversion .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 22]: There is no ice to bear a skate , there is only a vast sufficiency of cold mud , practically useless .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 63]: Sunshine flickers shiftily , coming and going without any honest purpose ; snow-squalls blow for five minutes , the flakes disappearing as they touch the earth ; half an hour later rain sputters , turns to snow and then turns back to rain -- and the sun disingenuously beams out again , only to be shut off like a rogue 's lantern .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 43]: And all the wretched while , if a boy sets foot out of doors , he must be harassed about his overcoat and rubbers ; he is warned against tracking up the plastic lawn and sharply advised to stay inside the house .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 7]: Saturday might as well be Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 4]: Thus the season .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 11]: Penrod had sought all possible means to pass the time .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 76]: A full half-hour of vehement yodelling in the Williams ' yard had failed to bring forth comrade Sam ; and at last a coloured woman had opened a window to inform Penrod that her intellect was being unseated by his vocalizations , which surpassed in unpleasantness , she claimed , every sound in her previous experience and , for the sake of definiteness , she stated her age to be fifty-three years and four months .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 49]: She added that all members of the Williams family had gone out of town to attend the funeral of a relative , but she wished that they might have remained to attend Penrod 's , which she confidently predicted as imminent if the neighbourhood followed its natural impulse .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 15]: Penrod listened for a time , but departed before the conclusion of the oration .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 29]: He sought other comrades , with no success ; he even went to the length of yodelling in the yard of that best of boys , Georgie Bassett .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 47]: Here was failure again , for Georgie signalled to him , through a closed window , that a closeting with dramatic literature was preferable to the society of a playmate ; and the book that Georgie exhibited was openly labelled , `` 300 Choice Declamations . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 30]: Georgie also managed to convey another reason for his refusal of Penrod 's companionship , the visitor being conversant with lip-reading through his studies at the `` movies . ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 5]: `` TOO MUDDY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 4]: Penrod went home .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 31]: `` Well , '' Mrs. Schofield said , having almost exhausted a mother 's powers of suggestion , `` well , why do n't you give Duke a bath ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 14]: She was that far depleted when Penrod came to her the third time .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 33]: Mothers ' suggestions are wonderful for little children but sometimes lack lustre when a boy approaches twelve an age to which the ideas of a Swede farm-hand would usually prove more congenial .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 18]: However , the dim and melancholy eye of Penrod showed a pale gleam , and he departed .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 6]: He gave Duke a bath .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 10]: The entertainment proved damp and discouraging for both parties .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 48]: Duke began to tremble even before he was lifted into the water , and after his first immersion he was revealed to be a dog weighing about one-fourth of what an observer of Duke , when Duke was dry , must have guessed his weight to be .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 16]: His wetness and the disclosure of his extreme fleshly insignificance appeared to mortify him profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 3]: He wept .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 43]: But , presently , under Penrod 's thorough ministrations -- for the young master was inclined to make this bath last as long as possible -- Duke plucked up a heart and began a series of passionate attempts to close the interview .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 24]: As this was his first bath since September , the effects were lavish and impressionistic , both upon Penrod and upon the bathroom .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 18]: However , the imperious boy 's loud remonstrances contributed to bring about the result desired by Duke .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 16]: Mrs. Schofield came running , and eloquently put an end to Duke 's winter bath .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 46]: When she had suggested this cleansing as a pleasant means of passing the time , she assumed that it would take place in a washtub in the cellar ; and Penrod 's location of the performance in her own bathroom was far from her intention .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 59]: Penrod found her language oppressive , and , having been denied the right to rub Duke dry with a bath-towel -- or even with the cover of a table in the next room -- the dismal boy , accompanied by his dismal dog , set forth , by way of the kitchen door , into the dismal weather .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 41]: With no purpose in mind , they mechanically went out to the alley , where Penrod leaned morosely against the fence , and Duke stood shivering close by , his figure still emaciated and his tail absolutely withdrawn from view .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 19]: There was a cold , wet wind , however ; and before long Duke found his condition unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 20]: He was past middle age and cared little for exercise ; but he saw that something must be done .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 16]: Therefore , he made a vigorous attempt to dry himself in a dog 's way .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 26]: Throwing himself , shoulders first , upon the alley mud , he slid upon it , back downward ; he rolled and rolled and rolled .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 24]: He began to feel lively and rolled the more ; in every way he convinced Penrod that dogs have no regard for appearances .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 37]: Also , having discovered an ex-fish near the Herman and Verman cottage , Duke confirmed an impression of Penrod 's that dogs have a peculiar fancy in the matter of odours that they like to wear .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 14]: Growing livelier and livelier , Duke now wished to play with his master .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 27]: Penrod was anything but fastidious ; nevertheless , under the circumstances , he withdrew to the kitchen , leaving Duke to play by himself , outside .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 19]: Della , the cook , was comfortably making rolls and entertaining a caller with a cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 29]: Penrod lingered a few moments , but found even his attention to the conversation ill received , while his attempts to take part in it met outright rebuff .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 27]: His feelings were hurt ; he passed broodingly to the front part of the house , and flung himself wearily into an armchair in the library .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 26]: With glazed eyes he stared at shelves of books that meant to him just what the wallpaper meant , and he sighed from the abyss .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 22]: His legs tossed and his arms flopped ; he got up , scratched himself exhaustively , and shuffled to a window .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 15]: Ten desolate minutes he stood there , gazing out sluggishly upon a soggy world .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 21]: During this time two wet delivery-wagons and four elderly women under umbrellas were all that crossed his field of vision .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 34]: Somewhere in the world , he thought , there was probably a boy who lived across the street from a jail or a fire-engine house , and had windows worth looking out of .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 39]: Penrod rubbed his nose up and down the pane slowly , continuously , and without the slightest pleasure ; and he again scratched himself wherever it was possible to do so , though he did not even itch .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 7]: There was nothing in his life .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 44]: Such boredom as he was suffering can become agony , and an imaginative creature may do wild things to escape it ; many a grown person has taken to drink on account of less pressure than was upon Penrod during that intolerable Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 29]: A faint sound in his ear informed him that Della , in the kitchen , had uttered a loud exclamation , and he decided to go back there .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 30]: However , since his former visit had resulted in a rebuff that still rankled , he paused outside the kitchen door , which was slightly ajar , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 16]: He did this idly , and with no hope of hearing anything interesting or helpful .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 4]: `` Snakes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 3]: Della exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 15]: `` Didja say the poor man was seein ' snakes , Mrs. Cullen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 15]: `` No , Della , '' Mrs. Cullen returned dolorously ; `` jist one .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 48]: Flora says he niver see more th 'n one -- jist one big , long , ugly-faced horrible black one ; the same one comin ' back an ' makin ' a fizzin ' n'ise at um iv ` ry time he had the fit on um .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 17]: 'T was alw ` ys the same snake ; an ' he 'd holler at Flora .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 14]: ` Here it comes ag ` in , oh , me soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 4]: he 'd holler .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 19]: ` The big , black , ugly-faced thing ; it 's as long as the front fence ! '
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 27]: he 'd holler , ` an ' it 's makin ' a fizzin ' n'ise at me , an ' breathin ' in me face ! '
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 4]: he 'd holler .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 62]: ` Fer th ' love o ' hivin ' , Flora , ' he 'd holler , ` it 's got a little black man wit ' a gassly white forehead a-pokin ' of it along wit ' a broom-handle , an ' a-sickin ' it on me , the same as a boy sicks a dog on a poor cat .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 33]: Fer the love o ' hivin ' , Flora , ' he 'd holler , ` cantcha fright it away from me before I go out o ' me head ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 5]: `` Poor Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 6]: said Della with deep compassion .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 21]: `` An ' the poor man out of his head all the time , an ' not knowin ' it !
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 20]: 'T was awful fer Flora to sit there an ' hear such things in the night like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 11]: `` You may believe yerself whin ye say it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 4]: Mrs. Cullen agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 42]: `` Right the very night the poor soul died , he was hollerin ' how the big black snake and the little black man wit ' the gassly white forehead a-pokin ' it wit ' a broomstick had come fer um .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 8]: ` Fright 'em away , Flora ! '
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 25]: he was croakin ' , in a v ` ice that hoarse an ' husky 't was hard to make out what he says .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 8]: ` Fright 'em away , Flora ! '
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 4]: he says . ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 33]: Tis the big , black , ugly-faced snake , as black as a black stockin ' an ' thicker round than me leg at the thigh before I was wasted away ! '
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 6]: he says , poor man .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 16]: ` It 's makin ' the fizzin ' n'ise awful to-night , ' he says .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 21]: ` An ' the little black man wit ' the gassly white forehead is a-laughin ' , ' he says .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 33]: ` He 's a-laughin ' an ' a-pokin ' the big , black , fizzin ' , ugly-faced snake wit ' his broomstick -- '' Della was unable to endure the description .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 12]: `` Do n't tell me no more , Mrs. Cullen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 3]: she protested .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 4]: `` Poor Tom !
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 13]: I thought Flora was wrong last week whin she hid the whisky .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 20]: 'T was takin ' it away from him that killed him -- an ' him already so sick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 39]: `` Well , '' said Mrs. Cullen , `` he hardly had the strengt ' to drink much , she tells me , after he see the big snake an ' the little black divil the first time .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 31]: Poor woman , she says he talked so plain she sees 'em both herself , iv ` ry time she looks at the poor body where it 's laid out .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 11]: She says -- '' `` Do n't tell me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 5]: cried the impressionable Della .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 9]: `` Do n't tell me , Mrs. Cullen !
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 14]: I can most see 'em meself , right here in me own kitchen !
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 3]: Poor Tom !
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 28]: To think whin I bought me new hat , only last week , the first time I 'd be wearin ' it 'd be to his funeral .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 7]: To-morrow afternoon , it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 10]: `` At two o'clock , '' said Mrs. Cullen .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 19]: `` Ye 'll be comin ' to th ' house to-night , o ' course , Della ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 8]: `` I will , '' said Della .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 25]: `` After what I 've been hearin ' from ye , I 'm ` most afraid to come , but I 'll do it .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 3]: Poor Tom !
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 29]: I remember the day him an ' Flora was married -- '' But the eavesdropper heard no more ; he was on his way up the back stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 14]: Life and light -- and purpose had come to his face once more .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 7]: Margaret was out for the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 19]: Unostentatiously , he went to her room , and for the next few minutes occupied himself busily therein .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 33]: He was so quiet that his mother , sewing in her own room , would not have heard him except for the obstinacy of one of the drawers in Margaret 's bureau .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 12]: Mrs. Schofield went to the door of her daughter 's room .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 9]: `` What are you doing , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 5]: `` Nothin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 15]: `` You 're not disturbing any of Margaret 's things , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 11]: `` No , ma'am , '' said the meek lad .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 11]: `` What did you jerk that drawer open for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 8]: `` You heard me , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 5]: `` Yes , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 9]: I was just lookin ' for sumpthing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 5]: `` For what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 4]: Mrs. Schofield asked .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 21]: `` You know that nothing of yours would be in Margaret 's room , Penrod , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 8]: `` What was it you wanted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 6]: she asked , rather impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 11]: `` I was just lookin ' for some pins . ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 19]: `` Very well , '' she said , and handed him two from the shoulder of her blouse .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 11]: `` I ought to have more , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 7]: `` I want about forty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 15]: `` I just want to MAKE sumpthing , Mamma , '' he said plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 4]: `` My goodness !
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 30]: Ca n't I even want to have a few pins without everybody makin ' such a fuss about it you 'd think I was doin ' a srime ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 8]: `` Doing a what , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 5]: `` A SRIME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 15]: he repeated , with emphasis ; and a moment 's reflection enlightened his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 7]: `` Oh , a crime ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 14]: `` You MUST quit reading the murder trials in the newspapers , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 23]: And when you read words you do n't know how to pronounce you ought to ask either your papa or me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 16]: `` Well , I am askin ' you about sumpthing now , '' Penrod said .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 23]: `` Ca n't I even have a few PINS without stoppin ' to talk about everything in the newspapers , Mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 35]: `` Yes , '' she said , laughing at his seriousness ; and she took him to her room , and bestowed upon him five or six rows torn from a paper of pins .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 20]: `` That ought to be plenty , '' she said , `` for whatever you want to make . ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 29]: And she smiled after his retreating figure , not noting that he looked softly bulky around the body , and held his elbows unnaturally tight to his sides .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 20]: She was assured of the innocence of anything to be made with pins , and forbore to press investigation .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 11]: For Penrod to be playing with pins seemed almost girlish .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 13]: Unhappy woman , it pleased her to have her son seem girlish !
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 35]: Penrod went out to the stable , tossed his pins into the wheelbarrow , then took from his pocket and unfolded six pairs of long black stockings , indubitably the property of his sister .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 22]: -LRB- Evidently Mrs. Schofield had been a little late in making her appearance at the door of Margaret 's room . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 31]: Penrod worked systematically ; he hung the twelve stockings over the sides of the wheelbarrow , and placed the wheelbarrow beside a large packing-box that was half full of excelsior .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 20]: One after another , he stuffed the stockings with excelsior , till they looked like twelve long black sausages .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 69]: Then he pinned the top of one stocking securely over the stuffed foot of another , pinning the top of a third to the foot of the second , the top of a fourth to the foot of the third -- and continued operations in this fashion until the twelve stockings were the semblance of one long and sinuous black body , sufficiently suggestive to any normal eye .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 52]: He tied a string to one end of this unpleasant-looking thing , led it around the stable , and , by vigorous manipulations , succeeded in making it wriggle realistically ; but he was not satisfied , and , dropping the string listlessly , sat down in the wheelbarrow to ponder .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 34]: Penrod sometimes proved that there were within him the makings of an artist ; he had become fascinated by an idea , and could not be content until that idea was beautifully realized .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 41]: He had meant to create a big , long , ugly-faced horrible black snake with which to interest Della and her friend , Mrs. Cullen ; but he felt that results , so far , were too crude for exploitation .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 17]: Merely to lead the pinned stockings by a string was little to fulfill his ambitious vision .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 8]: Finally , he rose from the wheelbarrow .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 9]: `` If I only had a cat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 4]: he said dreamily .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 8]: CREATIVE ART He went forth , seeking .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 19]: The Schofield household was catless this winter but there was a nice white cat at the Williams ' .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 10]: Penrod strolled thoughtfully over to the Williams 's yard .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 23]: He was entirely successful , not even having been seen by the sensitive coloured woman , aged fifty-three years and four months .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 6]: But still Penrod was thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 38]: The artist within him was unsatisfied with his materials : and upon his return to the stable he placed the cat beneath an overturned box , and once more sat down in the inspiring wheelbarrow , pondering .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 33]: His expression , concentrated and yet a little anxious , was like that of a painter at work upon a portrait that may or may not turn out to be a masterpiece .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 19]: The cat did not disturb him by her purring , though she was , indeed , already purring .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 50]: She was one of those cozy , youngish cats -- plump , even a little full-bodied , perhaps , and rather conscious of the figure -- that are entirely conventional and domestic by nature , and will set up a ladylike housekeeping anywhere without making a fuss about it .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 47]: If there be a fault in these cats , overcomplacency might be the name for it ; they err a shade too sure of themselves , and their assumption that the world means to treat them respectfully has just a little taint of the grande dame .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 28]: Consequently , they are liable to great outbreaks of nervous energy from within , engendered by the extreme surprises that life sometimes holds in store for them .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 6]: They lack the pessimistic imagination .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 20]: Mrs. Williams 's cat was content upon a strange floor and in the confining enclosure of a strange box .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 11]: She purred for a time , then trustfully fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 14]: 'T was well she slumbered ; she would need all her powers presently .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 38]: She slumbered , and dreamed not that she would wake to mingle with events that were to alter her serene disposition radically and cause her to become hasty-tempered and abnormally suspicious for the rest of her life .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 13]: Meanwhile , Penrod appeared to reach a doubtful solution of his problem .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 40]: His expression was still somewhat clouded as he brought from the storeroom of the stable a small fragment of a broken mirror , two paint brushes and two old cans , one containing black paint and the other white .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 33]: He regarded himself earnestly in the mirror ; then , with some reluctance , he dipped a brush into one of the cans , and slowly painted his nose a midnight black .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 29]: He was on the point of spreading this decoration to cover the lower part of his face , when he paused , brush halfway between can and chin .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 17]: What arrested him was a sound from the alley -- a sound of drumming upon tin .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 16]: The eyes of Penrod became significant of rushing thoughts ; his expression cleared and brightened .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 11]: He ran to the alley doors and flung them open .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 6]: `` Oh , Verman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 20]: Marching up and down before the cottage across the alley , Verman plainly considered himself to be an army .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 30]: Hanging from his shoulders by a string was an old tin wash-basin , whereon he beat cheerily with two dry bones , once the chief support of a chicken .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 6]: Thus he assuaged his ennui .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 12]: `` Verman , come on in here , '' Penrod called .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 15]: `` I got sumpthing for you to do you 'll like awful well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 10]: Verman halted , ceased to drum , and stared .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 31]: His gaze was not fixed particularly upon Penrod 's nose , however , and neither now nor later did he make any remark or gesture referring to this casual eccentricity .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 11]: He expected things like that upon Penrod or Sam Williams .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 16]: And as for Penrod himself , he had already forgotten that his nose was painted .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 7]: `` Come on , Verman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 8]: Verman continued to stare , not moving .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 17]: He had received such invitations before , and they had not always resulted to his advantage .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 21]: Within that stable things had happened to him the like of which he was anxious to avoid in the future .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 9]: `` Oh , come ahead , Verman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 31]: Penrod urged , and , divining logic in the reluctance confronting him , he added , `` This ai n't goin ' to be anything like last time , Verman .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 11]: I got sumpthing just SPLENDUD for you to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 11]: Verman 's expression hardened ; he shook his head decisively .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 7]: `` Mo , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 9]: `` Oh , COME on , Verman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 3]: Penrod pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 14]: `` It is n't anything goin ' to HURT you , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 25]: I tell you it 's sumpthing you 'd give a good deal to GET to do , if you knew what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 4]: `` Mo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 4]: said Verman firmly .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 7]: `` I mome maw woo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 4]: Penrod offered arguments .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 6]: `` Look , Verman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 10]: `` Listen here a minute , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 15]: How d'you know you do n't want to until you know what it is ?
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 34]: A person CA N'T know they do n't want to do a thing even before the other person tells 'em what they 're goin ' to get 'em to do , can they ?
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 30]: For all you know , this thing I 'm goin ' to get you to do might be sumpthing you would n't miss doin ' for anything there is !
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 54]: For all you know , Verman , it might be sumpthing like this : well , f ` rinstance , s ` pose I was standin ' here , and you were over there , sort of like the way you are now , and I says , ` Hello , Verman ! '
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 49]: and then I 'd go on and tell you there was sumpthing I was goin ' to get you to do ; and you 'd say you would n't do it , even before you heard what it was , why where 'd be any sense to THAT ?
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 24]: For all you know , I might of been goin ' to get you to eat a five-cent bag o ' peanuts . ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 38]: Verman had listened obdurately until he heard the last few words ; but as they fell upon his ear , he relaxed , and advanced to the stable doors , smiling and extending his open right hand .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 8]: `` Aw wi , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 6]: `` Gi 'm here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 23]: `` Well , '' Penrod returned , a trifle embarrassed , `` I did n't say it WAS peanuts , did I ?
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 31]: Honest , Verman , it 's sumpthing you 'll like better 'n a few old peanuts that most of 'em 'd prob ` ly have worms in 'em , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 21]: All I want you to do is -- '' But Verman was not favourably impressed ; his face hardened again .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 4]: `` Mo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 8]: he said , and prepared to depart .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 10]: `` Look here , Verman , '' Penrod urged .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 25]: `` It is n't goin ' to hurt you just to come in here and see what I got for you , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 11]: You can do that much , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 33]: Surely such an appeal must have appeared reasonable , even to Verman , especially since its effect was aided by the promising words , `` See what I got for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 12]: Certainly Verman yielded to it , though perhaps a little suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 10]: He advanced a few cautious steps into the stable .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 4]: `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 24]: Penrod cried , and he ran to the stuffed and linked stockings , seized the leading-string , and vigorously illustrated his further remarks .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 20]: `` How 's that for a big , long , ugly-faced horr ` ble black ole snake , Verman ?
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 14]: Look at her follow me all round anywhere I feel like goin ' !
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 10]: Look at her wiggle , will you , though ?
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 12]: Look how I make her do anything I tell her to .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 21]: Lay down , you ole snake , you -- See her lay down when I tell her to , Verman ?
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 8]: Wiggle , you ole snake , you !
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 7]: See her wiggle , Verman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 4]: `` Hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 6]: Undoubtedly Verman felt some pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 8]: `` Now , listen , Verman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 12]: Penrod continued , hastening to make the most of the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 3]: `` Listen !
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 11]: I fixed up this good ole snake just for you .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 11]: I 'm goin ' to give her to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 4]: `` HI ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 39]: On account of a previous experience not unconnected with cats , and likely to prejudice Verman , Penrod decided to postpone mentioning Mrs. Williams 's pet until he should have secured Verman 's cooperation in the enterprise irretrievably .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 41]: `` All you got to do , '' he went on , `` is to chase this good ole snake around , and sort o ' laugh and keep pokin ' it with the handle o ' that rake yonder .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 24]: I 'm goin ' to saw it off just so 's you can poke your good ole snake with it , Verman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 22]: `` Aw wi , '' said Verman , and , extending his open hand again , he uttered a hopeful request .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 4]: `` Peamup ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 9]: His host perceived that Verman had misunderstood him .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 4]: `` Peanuts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 4]: `` My goodness !
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 12]: I did n't say I HAD any peanuts , did I ?
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 14]: I only said s ` pose f ` rinstance I DID have some .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 3]: My goodness !
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 46]: You do n't expeck me to go round here all day workin ' like a dog to make a good ole snake for you and then give you a bag o ' peanuts to hire you to play with it , do you , Verman ?
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 4]: My goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 10]: Verman 's hand fell , with a little disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 17]: `` Aw wi , '' he said , consenting to accept the snake without the bonus .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 6]: `` That 's the boy !
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 59]: NOW we 're all right , Verman ; and pretty soon I 'm goin ' to saw that rake-handle off for you , too ; so 's you can kind o ' guide your good ole snake around with it ; but first -- well , first there 's just one more thing 's got to be done .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 14]: I 'll show you -- it wo n't take but a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 22]: Then , while Verman watched him wonderingly , he went to the can of white paint and dipped a brush therein .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 19]: `` It wo n't get on your clo'es much , or anything , Verman , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 32]: `` I only just got to -- '' But as he approached , dripping brush in hand , the wondering look was all gone from Verman ; determination took its place .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 4]: `` Mo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 12]: he said , turned his back , and started for outdoors .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 10]: `` Look here , Verman , '' Penrod cried .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 13]: `` I have n't done anything to you yet , have I ?
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 12]: It is n't goin ' to hurt you , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 17]: You act like a little teeny bit o ' paint was goin ' to kill you .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 7]: What 's the matter of you ?
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 32]: I only just got to paint the top part of your face ; I 'm not goin ' to TOUCH the other part of it -- nor your hands or anything .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 11]: All _ I _ want -- '' `` MO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 6]: said Verman from the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 7]: `` Oh , my goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 16]: moaned Penrod ; and in desperation he drew forth from his pocket his entire fortune .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 11]: `` All right , Verman , '' he said resignedly .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 30]: `` If you wo n't do it any other way , here 's a nickel , and you can go and buy you some peanuts when we get through .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 32]: But if I give you this money , you got to promise to wait till we ARE through , and you got to promise to do anything I tell you to .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 7]: You goin ' to promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 27]: The eyes of Verman glistened ; he returned , gave bond , and , grasping the coin , burst into the rich laughter of a gourmand .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 19]: Penrod immediately painted him dead white above the eyes , all round his head and including his hair .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 9]: It took all the paint in the can .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 50]: Then the artist mentioned the presence of Mrs. Williams 's cat , explained in full his ideas concerning the docile animal , and the long black snake , and Della and her friend , Mrs. Cullen , while Verman listened with anxiety , but remained true to his oath .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 25]: They removed the stocking at the end of the long black snake , and cut four holes in the foot and ankle of it .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 69]: They removed the excelsior , placed Mrs. Williams 's cat in the stocking , shook her down into the lower section of it ; drew her feet through the four holes there , leaving her head in the toe of the stocking ; then packed the excelsior down on top of her , and once more attached the stocking to the rest of the long , black snake .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 9]: How shameful is the ease of the historian !
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 49]: He sits in his dressing-gown to write : `` The enemy attacked in force -- '' The tranquil pen , moving in a cloud of tobacco smoke , leaves upon the page its little hieroglyphics , serenely summing up the monstrous deeds and sufferings of men of action .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 41]: How cold , how niggardly , to state merely that Penrod and the painted Verman succeeded in giving the long , black snake a motive power , or tractor , apparently its own but consisting of Mrs. Williams 's cat !
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 58]: She was drowsy when they lifted her from the box ; she was still drowsy when they introduced part of her into the orifice of the stocking ; but she woke to full , vigorous young life when she perceived that their purpose was for her to descend into the black depths of that stocking head first .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 60]: Verman held the mouth of the stocking stretched , and Penrod manipulated the cat ; but she left her hearty mark on both of them before , in a moment of unfortunate inspiration , she humped her back while she was upside down , and Penrod took advantage of the concavity to increase it even more than she desired .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 23]: The next instant she was assisted downward into the gloomy interior , with excelsior already beginning to block the means of egress .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 83]: Gymnastic moments followed ; there were times when both boys hurled themselves full-length upon the floor , seizing the animated stocking with far-extended hands ; and even when the snake was a complete thing , with legs growing from its unquestionably ugly face , either Penrod or Verman must keep a grasp upon it , for it would not be soothed , and refused , over and over , to calm itself , even when addressed as , `` Poor pussy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 8]: and `` Nice ` ittle kitty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 67]: Finally , they thought they had their good ole snake `` about quieted down '' , as Penrod said , because the animated head had remained in one place for an unusual length of time , though the legs produced a rather sinister effect of crouching , and a noise like a distant planing-mill came from the interior -- and then Duke appeared in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 6]: He was still feeling lively .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 70]: THE DEPARTING GUEST By the time Penrod returned from chasing Duke to the next corner , Verman had the long , black snake down from the rafter where its active head had taken refuge , with the rest of it dangling ; and both boys agreed that Mrs. Williams 's cat must certainly be able to `` see SOME , anyway '' , through the meshes of the stocking .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 72]: `` Well , '' said Penrod , `` it 's gettin ' pretty near dark , what with all this bother and mess we been havin ' around here , and I expeck as soon as I get this good ole broom-handle fixed out of the rake for you , Verman , it 'll be about time to begin what we had to go and take all this trouble FOR . ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 32]: ... Mr. Schofield had brought an old friend home to dinner with him : `` Dear old Joe Gilling , '' he called this friend when introducing him to Mrs. Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 35]: Mr. Gilling , as Mrs. Schofield was already informed by telephone , had just happened to turn up in town that day , and had called on his classmate at the latter 's office .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 11]: The two had not seen each other in eighteen years .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 84]: Mr. Gilling was a tall man , clad highly in the mode , and brought to a polished and powdered finish by barber and manicurist ; but his colour was peculiar , being almost unhumanly florid , and , as Mrs. Schofield afterward claimed to have noticed , his eyes `` wore a nervous , apprehensive look '' , his hands were tremulous , and his manner was `` queer and jerky '' -- at least , that is how she defined it .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 20]: She was not surprised to hear him state that he was travelling for his health and not upon business .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 13]: He had not been really well for several years , he said .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 14]: At that , Mr. Schofield laughed and slapped him heartily on the back .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 6]: `` Oh , mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 9]: Mr. Gilling cried , leaping in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 7]: `` What IS the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 4]: `` Nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 4]: Mr. Schofield laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 17]: `` I just slapped you the way we used to slap each other on the campus .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 16]: What I was going to say was that you have no business being a bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 26]: With all your money , and nothing to do but travel and sit around hotels and clubs , no wonder you 've grown bilious . ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 16]: `` Oh , no ; I 'm not bilious , '' Mr. Gilling said uncomfortably .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 9]: `` I 'm not bilious at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 12]: `` You ought to get married , '' Mr. Schofield returned .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 15]: `` You ought -- '' He paused , for Mr. Gilling had jumped again .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 9]: `` What 's the trouble , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 17]: I thought perhaps -- perhaps you were going to slap me on the back again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 14]: `` Not this time , '' Mr. Schofield said , renewing his laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 9]: `` Well , is dinner about ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 8]: he asked , turning to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 8]: `` Where are Margaret and Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 12]: `` Margaret 's just come in , '' Mrs. Schofield answered .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 16]: `` She 'll be down in a minute , and Penrod 's around somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 4]: `` Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 12]: Mr. Gilling repeated curiously , in his nervous , serious way .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 6]: `` What is Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 13]: And at this , Mrs. Schofield joined in her husband 's laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 4]: Mr. Schofield explained .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 11]: `` Penrod 's our young son , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 30]: `` He 's not much for looks , maybe ; but he 's been pretty good lately , and sometimes we 're almost inclined to be proud of him .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 12]: You 'll see him in a minute , old Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 7]: Old Joe saw him even sooner .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 25]: Instantly , as Mr. Schofield finished his little prediction , the most shocking uproar ever heard in that house burst forth in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 34]: Distinctly Irish shrieks unlimited came from that quarter -- together with the clashing of hurled metal and tin , the appealing sound of breaking china , and the hysterical barking of a dog .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 24]: The library door flew open , and Mrs. Cullen appeared as a mingled streak crossing the room from one door to the other .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 57]: She was followed by a boy with a coal-black nose and between his feet , as he entered , there appeared a big long , black , horrible snake , with frantic legs springing from what appeared to be its head ; and it further fulfilled Mrs. Cullen 's description by making a fizzin ' noise .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 34]: Accompanying the snake , and still faithfully endeavouring to guide it with the detached handle of a rake , was a small black demon with a gassly white forehead and gasslier white hair .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 24]: Duke evidently still feeling his bath , was doing all in his power to aid the demon in making the snake step lively .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 13]: A few kitchen implements followed this fugitive procession through the library doorway .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 21]: The long , black snake became involved with a leg of the heavy table in the centre of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 55]: The head developed spasms of agility ; there were clangings and rippings , then the foremost section of the long , black snake detached itself , bounded into the air , and , after turning a number of somersaults , became , severally , a torn stocking , excelsior , and a lunatic cat .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 31]: The ears of this cat were laid back flat upon its head and its speed was excessive upon a fairly circular track it laid out for itself in the library .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 42]: Flying round this orbit , it perceived the open doorway ; passed through it , thence to the kitchen , and outward and onward -- Della having left the kitchen door open in her haste as she retired to the backyard .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 40]: The black demon with the gassly white forehead and hair , finding himself in the presence of grown people who were white all over , turned in his tracks and followed Mrs. Williams 's cat to the great outdoors .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 4]: Duke preceded Verman .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 4]: Mrs. Cullen vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 14]: Of the apparition , only wreckage and a rightfully apprehensive Penrod were left .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 29]: `` But where , '' Mrs. Schofield began , a few minutes later , looking suddenly mystified -- `` where -- where -- '' `` Where what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 5]: Mr. Schofield asked testily .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 8]: `` What are you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 19]: His nerves were jarred , and he was rather hoarse after what he had been saying to Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 18]: -LRB- That regretful necromancer was now upstairs doing unhelpful things to his nose over a washstand . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 16]: `` What do you mean by , ` Where , where , where ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 4]: Mr. Schofield demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 11]: `` I do n't see any sense to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 9]: `` But where is your old classmate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 7]: `` Where 's Mr. Gilling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 10]: She was the first to notice this striking absence .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 4]: Mr. Schofield exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 7]: `` Where IS old Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 3]: Margaret intervened .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 13]: `` You mean that tall , pale man who was calling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 6]: `` Pale , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 4]: said her father .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 23]: `` He 's as flushed as -- '' `` He was pale when _ I _ saw him , '' Margaret said .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 25]: `` He had his hat and coat , and he was trying to get out of the front door when I came running downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 30]: He could n't work the catch for a minute ; but before I got to the foot of the steps he managed to turn it and open the door .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 20]: He went out before I could think what to say to him , he was in such a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 18]: I guess everything was so confused you did n't notice -- but he 's certainly gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 7]: Mrs. Schofield turned to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 13]: `` But I thought he was going to stay to dinner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 10]: Mr. Schofield shook his head , admitting himself floored .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 39]: Later , having mentally gone over everything that might shed light on the curious behaviour of old Joe , he said , without preface : `` He was n't at all dissipated when we were in college . ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 5]: Mrs. Schofield nodded severely .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 21]: `` Maybe this was just the best thing could have happened to him , after all , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 10]: `` It may be , '' her husband returned .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 9]: `` I do n't say it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 20]: BUT that is n't going to make any difference in what I 'm going to do to Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 30]: YEARNINGS The next day a new ambition entered into Penrod Schofield ; it was heralded by a flourish of trumpets and set up a great noise within his being .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 69]: On his way home from Sunday-school he had paused at a corner to listen to a brass band , which was returning from a funeral , playing a medley of airs from `` The Merry Widow , '' and as the musicians came down the street , walking so gracefully , the sun picked out the gold braid upon their uniforms and splashed fire from their polished instruments .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 28]: Penrod marked the shapes of the great bass horns , the suave sculpture of their brazen coils , and the grand , sensational flare of their mouths .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 31]: And he saw plainly that these noble things , to be mastered , needed no more than some breath blown into them during the fingering of a few simple keys .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 23]: Then obediently they gave forth those vast but dulcet sounds which stirred his spirit as no other sounds could stir it quite .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 17]: The leader of the band , walking ahead , was a pleasing figure , nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 22]: Penrod supposed him to be a mere decoration , and had never sympathized with Sam Williams ' deep feeling about drum-majors .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 57]: The cornets , the trombones , the smaller horns were rather interesting , of course ; and the drums had charm , especially the bass drum , which must be partially supported by a youth in front ; but , immeasurably above all these , what fascinated Penrod was the little man with the monster horn .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 45]: There Penrod 's widening eyes remained transfixed -- upon the horn , so dazzling , with its broad spaces of brassy highlights , and so overwhelming , with its mouth as wide as a tub ; that there was something almost threatening about it .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 34]: The little , elderly band-musician walked manfully as he blew his great horn ; and in that pompous engine of sound , the boy beheld a spectacle of huge forces under human control .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 36]: To Penrod , the horn meant power , and the musician meant mastery over power , though , of course , Penrod did not know that this was how he really felt about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 81]: Grandiloquent sketches were passing and interchanging before his mind 's eye -- Penrod , in noble raiment , marching down the staring street , his shoulders swaying professionally , the roar of the horn he bore submerging all other sounds ; Penrod on horseback , blowing the enormous horn and leading wild hordes to battle , while Marjorie Jones looked on from the sidewalk ; Penrod astounding his mother and father and sister by suddenly serenading them in the library .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 15]: `` Why , Penrod , where DID you learn to play like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 36]: These were vague and shimmering glories of vision rather than definite plans for his life work , yet he did with all his will determine to own and play upon some roaring instrument of brass .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 26]: And , after all , this was no new desire of his ; it was only an old one inflamed to take a new form .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 21]: Nor was music the root of it , for the identical desire is often uproarious among them that hate music .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 29]: What stirred in Penrod was new neither in him nor in the world , but old -- old as old Adam , old as the childishness of man .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 20]: All children have it , of course : they are all anxious to Make a Noise in the World .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 40]: While the band approached , Penrod marked the time with his feet ; then he fell into step and accompanied the musicians down the street , keeping as near as possible to the little man with the big horn .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 42]: There were four or five other boys , strangers , also marching with the band , but these were light spirits , their flushed faces and prancing legs proving that they were merely in a state of emotional reaction to music .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 9]: Penrod , on the contrary , was grave .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 22]: He kept his eyes upon the big horn , and , now and then , he gave an imitation of it .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 35]: His fingers moved upon invisible keys , his cheeks puffed out , and , from far down in his throat , he produced strange sounds : `` Taw , p ` taw-p ` taw !
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 8]: Taw , p ` taw-p ` taw !
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 3]: PAW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 26]: The other boys turned back when the musicians ceased to play , but Penrod marched on , still keeping close to what so inspired him .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 42]: He stayed with the band till the last member of it disappeared up a staircase in an office-building , down at the business end of the street ; and even after that he lingered a while , looking at the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 28]: Finally , however , he set his face toward home , whither he marched in a procession , the visible part of which consisted of himself alone .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 37]: All the way the rhythmic movements of his head kept time with his marching feet and , also , with a slight rise and fall of his fingers at about the median line of his abdomen .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 33]: And pedestrians who encountered him in this preoccupation were not surprised to hear , as he passed , a few explosive little vocalizations : `` Taw , p ` taw-p ` taw !
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 2]: TAW !
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 3]: Taw-aw-HAW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 20]: These were the outward symptoms of no fleeting impulse , but of steadfast desire ; therefore they were persistent .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 45]: The likeness of the great bass horn remained upon the retina of his mind 's eye , losing nothing of its brazen enormity with the passing of hours , nor abating , in his mind 's ear , one whit of its fascinating blatancy .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 41]: Penrod might have forgotten almost anything else more readily ; for such a horn has this double compulsion : people can not possibly keep themselves from looking at its possessor -- and they certainly have GOT to listen to him !
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 31]: Penrod was preoccupied at dinner and during the evening , now and then causing his father some irritation by croaking , `` Taw , p ` taw-p ` taw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 6]: while the latter was talking .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 36]: And when bedtime came for the son of the house , he mounted the stairs in a rhythmic manner , and p ` tawed himself through the upper hall as far as his own chamber .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 16]: Even after he had gone to bed , there came a revival of these manifestations .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 69]: His mother had put out his light for him and had returned to the library downstairs ; three-quarters of an hour had elapsed since then , and Margaret was in her room , next to his , when a continuous low croaking -LRB- which she was just able to hear -RRB- suddenly broke out into loud , triumphal blattings : `` TAW , p ` taw-p ` taw-aw-HAW !
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 4]: P'taw - WAW-aw !
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 3]: Aw-PAW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 11]: `` Penrod , '' Margaret called , `` stop that !
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 7]: I 'm trying to write letters .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 22]: If you do n't quit and go to sleep , I 'll call papa up , and you 'll SEE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 38]: The noise ceased , or , rather , it tapered down to a desultory faint croaking which finally died out ; but there can be little doubt that Penrod 's last waking thoughts were of instrumental music .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 31]: And in the morning , when he woke to face the gloomy day 's scholastic tasks , something unusual and eager fawned in his face with the return of memory .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 6]: `` Taw-p ` taw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 3]: he began .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 4]: `` PAW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 44]: All day , in school and out , his mind was busy with computations -- not such as are prescribed by mathematical pedants , but estimates of how much old rags and old iron would sell for enough money to buy a horn .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 57]: Happily , the next day , at lunch , he was able to dismiss this problem from his mind : he learned that his Uncle Joe would be passing through town , on his way from Nevada , the following afternoon , and all the Schofield family were to go to the station to see him .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 7]: Penrod would be excused from school .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 16]: At this news his cheeks became pink , and for a moment he was breathless .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 21]: Uncle Joe and Penrod did not meet often , but when they did , Uncle Joe invariably gave Penrod money .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 18]: Moreover , he always managed to do it privately so that later there was no bothersome supervision .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 10]: Last time he had given Penrod a silver dollar .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 29]: At thirty-five minutes after two , Wednesday afternoon , Uncle Joe 's train came into the station , and Uncle Joe got out and shouted among his relatives .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 29]: At eighteen minutes before three he was waving to them from the platform of the last car , having just slipped a two-dollar bill into Penrod 's breast-pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 22]: And , at seven minutes after three , Penrod opened the door of the largest `` music store '' in town .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 27]: A tall , exquisite , fair man , evidently a musical earl , stood before him , leaning whimsically upon a piano of the highest polish .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 18]: The sight abashed Penrod not a bit -- his remarkable financial condition even made him rather peremptory .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 23]: `` See here , '' he said brusquely : `` I want to look at that big horn in the window . ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 15]: `` Very well , '' said the earl ; `` look at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 9]: And leaned more luxuriously upon the polished piano .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 43]: `` I meant -- '' Penrod began , but paused , something daunted , while an unnamed fear brought greater mildness into his voice , as he continued , `` I meant -- I -- How much IS that big horn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 5]: `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 4]: the earl repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 16]: `` I mean , '' said Penrod , `` how much is it worth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 11]: `` I do n't know , '' the earl returned .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 8]: `` Its price is eighty-five dollars . ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 36]: `` Eighty-fi -- '' Penrod began mechanically , but was forced to pause and swallow a little air that obstructed his throat , as the difference between eighty-five and two became more and more startling .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 18]: He had entered the store , rich ; in the last ten seconds he had become poverty-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 9]: Eighty-five dollars was the same as eighty-five millions .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 33]: `` Shall I put it aside for you , '' asked the salesman-earl , `` while you look around the other stores to see if there 's anything you like better ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 18]: `` I guess -- I guess not , '' said Penrod , whose face had grown red .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 49]: He swallowed again , scraped the floor with the side of his right shoe , scratched the back of his neck , and then , trying to make his manner casual and easy , `` Well I ca n't stand around here all day , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 13]: `` I got to be gettin ' on up the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 7]: `` Business , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 21]: Penrod , turning to the door , suspected jocularity , but he found himself without recourse ; he was nonplussed .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 24]: `` Sure you wo n't let me have that horn tied up in nice wrapping-paper in case you decide to take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 67]: Penrod was almost positive that the spirit of this question was satirical ; but he was unable to reply , except by a feeble shake of the head -- though ten minutes later , as he plodded forlornly his homeward way , he looked over his shoulder and sent backward a few words of morose repartee : `` Oh , I am , am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 16]: he muttered , evidently concluding a conversation which he had continued mentally with the salesman .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 20]: `` Well , you 're double anything you call me , so that makes you a smart Aleck twice !
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 6]: Ole double smart Aleck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 16]: After that , he walked with the least bit more briskness , but not much .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 19]: No wonder he felt discouraged : there are times when eighty-five dollars can be a blow to anybody !
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 14]: Penrod was so stunned that he actually forgot what was in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 15]: He passed two drug stores , and they had absolutely no meaning to him .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 10]: He walked all the way without spending a cent .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 32]: At home he spent a moment in the kitchen pantry while the cook was in the cellar ; then he went out to the stable and began some really pathetic experiments .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 24]: His materials were the small tin funnel which he had obtained in the pantry , and a short section of old garden hose .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 21]: He inserted the funnel into one end of the garden hose , and made it fast by wrappings of cord .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 28]: Then he arranged the hose in a double , circular coil , tied it so that it would remain coiled , and blew into the other end .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 52]: He blew and blew and blew ; he set his lips tight together , as he had observed the little musician with the big horn set his , and blew and sputtered , and sputtered and blew , but nothing of the slightest importance happened in the orifice of the funnel .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 4]: Still he blew .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 21]: He began to be dizzy ; his eyes watered ; his expression became as horrible as a strangled person 's .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 6]: He but blew the more .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 7]: He stamped his feet and blew .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 25]: He staggered to the wheelbarrow , sat , and blew -- and yet the funnel uttered nothing ; it seemed merely to breathe hard .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 30]: It would not sound like a horn , and , when Penrod finally gave up , he had to admit piteously that it did not look like a horn .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 13]: No boy over nine could have pretended that it was a horn .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 17]: He tossed the thing upon the floor , and leaned back in the wheelbarrow , inert .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 6]: `` Yay , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 19]: Sam Williams appeared in the doorway , and , behind Sam , Master Roderick Magsworth Bitts , Junior .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 6]: `` Yay , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 5]: Penrod made no response .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 19]: The two came in , and Sam picked up the poor contrivance Penrod had tossed upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 8]: `` What 's this ole dingus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 3]: Sam asked .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 5]: `` Nothin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 9]: `` Well , what 's it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 8]: `` Nothin ' , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 10]: `` It 's a kind of a horn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 5]: `` What kind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 9]: `` For music , '' said Penrod simply .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 11]: Master Bitts laughed loud and long ; he was derisive .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 4]: `` Music ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 3]: he yipped .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 10]: `` I thought you meant a cow 's horn !
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 9]: He says it 's a music-horn , Sam ?
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 8]: What you think o ' that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 7]: Sam blew into the thing industriously .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 10]: `` It wo n't work , '' he announced .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 7]: `` Course it wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 4]: Roddy Bitts shouted .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 14]: `` You ca n't make it go without you got a REAL horn .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 33]: I 'm goin ' to get me a real horn some day before long , and then you 'll see me goin ' up and down here playin ' it like sixty !
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 13]: I 'll -- '' '' ` Some day before long ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 3]: Sam mocked .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 6]: `` Yes , we will !
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 16]: Why 'n' t you get it to-day , if you 're goin ' to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 8]: `` I would , '' said Roddy .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 23]: `` I 'd go get the money from my father right now , only he would n't give it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 19]: Sam whooped , and Penrod , in spite of his great depression , uttered a few jibing sounds .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 28]: `` I 'd get MY father to buy me a fire-engine and team o ' HORSES , '' Sam bellowed , `` only he would n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 8]: `` Listen , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 3]: cried Roddy .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 14]: `` I mean he would most any time , but not this month .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 42]: I ca n't have any money for a month beginning last Saturday , because I got paint on one of our dogs , and he came in the house with it on him , and got some on pretty near everything .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 18]: If it had n't ` a ' been for that -- '' `` Oh , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 3]: said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 12]: `` If it had n't ` a ' been for that !
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 6]: It 's always SUMPTHING ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 6]: `` It is not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 16]: `` Well , then , why 'n' t you go GET a real horn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 8]: Roddy 's face had flushed with irritation .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 30]: `` Well , did n't I just TELL you -- '' he began , but paused , while the renewal of some interesting recollection became visible in his expression .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 17]: `` Why , I COULD , if I wanted to , '' he said more calmly .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 11]: `` It would n't be a new one , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 22]: I guess it would be kind of an old one , but -- '' `` Oh , a toy horn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 3]: said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 33]: `` I expect one you had when you were three years old , and your mother stuck it up in the attic to keep till you 're dead , or sumpthing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 13]: `` It 's not either any toy horn , '' Roddy insisted .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 23]: `` It 's a reg ` lar horn for a band , and I could have it as easy as anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 15]: The tone of this declaration was so sincere that it roused the lethargic Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 8]: `` Roddy , is that true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 7]: he sat up to inquire piercingly .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 7]: `` Of course it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 4]: Master Bitts returned .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 7]: `` What you take me for ?
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 14]: I could go get that horn this minute if I wanted to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 8]: `` A real one -- honest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 14]: `` Well , did n't I say it was a real one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 7]: `` Like in the BAND ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 10]: `` I said so , did n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 15]: `` I guess you mean one of those little ones , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 6]: `` No , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 11]: Roddy insisted stoutly ; `` it 's a big one !
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 20]: It winds around in a big circle that would go all the way around a pretty fat man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 8]: `` What store is it in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 12]: `` It 's not in any store , '' said Roddy .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 9]: `` It 's at my Uncle Ethelbert 's .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 28]: He 's got this horn and three or four pianos and a couple o ' harps and -- '' `` Does he keep a music store ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 15]: These harps and pianos and all such are old ones -- awful old . ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 15]: `` Oh , '' said Sam , `` he runs a second-hand store ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 6]: `` He does not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 5]: Master Bitts returned angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 7]: `` He does n't do anything .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 6]: He 's just got 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 7]: He 's got forty-one guitars . ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 4]: `` Yay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 9]: Sam whooped , and jumped up and down .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 11]: `` Listen to Roddy Bitts makin ' up lies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 9]: `` You look out , Sam Williams ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 4]: said Roddy threateningly .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 11]: `` You look out how you call me names ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 9]: `` What name 'd I call you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 11]: `` You just the same as said I told lies .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 17]: That 's just as good as callin ' me a liar , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 20]: `` No , '' said Sam ; `` but I got a right to , if I want to .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 7]: Have n't I , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 4]: Roddy demanded hotly .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 9]: `` How you got a right to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 11]: `` Because you ca n't prove what you said . ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 29]: `` Well , '' said Roddy , `` you 'd be just as much of one if you ca n't prove what I said WAS N'T true . ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 5]: `` No , sir !
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 11]: You either got to prove it or be a liar .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 7]: Is n't that so , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 25]: `` Yes , sir , '' Penrod ruled , with a little importance , `` that 's the way it is , Roddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 26]: `` Well , then , '' said Roddy , `` come on over to my Uncle Ethelbert 's , and I 'll show you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 19]: `` I would n't walk over there just to find out sumpthing I already know is n't so .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 16]: Outside of a music store there is n't anybody in the world got forty-one guitars !
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 25]: I 've heard lots o ' people TALK , but I never heard such a big l -- '' `` You shut up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 3]: shouted Roddy .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 8]: `` You ole -- '' Penrod interposed .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 13]: `` Why 'n' t you show us the horn , Roddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 8]: `` You said you could get it .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 11]: You show us the horn and we 'll believe you .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 24]: If you show us the horn , Sam 'll haf to take what he said back ; wo n't you , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' said Sam , and added .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 7]: `` He has n't got any .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 19]: He went and told a -- '' Roddy 's eyes were bright with rage ; he breathed noisily .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 6]: `` I have n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 13]: `` You just wait here , and I 'll show you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 8]: And he ran furiously from the stable .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 13]: THE HORN OF FAME `` Bet he wo n't come back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 3]: said Sam .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 7]: `` Well , he might . ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 34]: `` Well , if he does and he has n't got any horn , I got a right to call him anything I want to , and he 's got to stand it .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 37]: And if he does n't come back , '' Sam continued , as by the code , `` then I got a right to call him whatever I like next time I ketch him out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 18]: `` I expect he 'll have SOME kind of ole horn , maybe , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 15]: `` No , '' the skeptical Sam insisted , `` he wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 4]: But Roddy did .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 40]: Twenty minutes elapsed , and both the waiting boys had decided that they were legally entitled to call him whatever they thought fitting , when he burst in , puffing ; and in his hands he bore a horn .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 38]: It was a `` real '' one , and of a kind that neither Penrod nor Sam had ever seen before , though they failed to realize this , because its shape was instantly familiar to them .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 42]: No horn could have been simpler : it consisted merely of one circular coil of brass with a mouthpiece at one end for the musician , and a wide-flaring mouth of its own , for the noise , at the other .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 26]: But it was obviously a second-hand horn ; dents slightly marred it , here and there , and its surface was dull , rather greenish .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 18]: There were no keys ; and a badly faded green cord and tassel hung from the coil .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 10]: Even so shabby a horn as this electrified Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 43]: It was not a stupendous horn , but it was a horn , and when a boy has been sighing for the moon , a piece of green cheese will satisfy him , for he can play that it is the moon .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 7]: `` Gim me that HORN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 9]: Penrod shouted , as he dashed for it .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 4]: `` YAY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 11]: Sam cried , and sought to wrest it from him .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 18]: Roddy joined the scuffle , trying to retain the horn ; but Penrod managed to secure it .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 16]: With one free hand he fended the others off while he blew into the mouthpiece .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 10]: `` Let me have it , '' Sam urged .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 9]: `` You ca n't do anything with it .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 8]: Lem me take it , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 3]: said Roddy .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 4]: `` Let ME !
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 3]: My goodness !
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 13]: Ai n't I got any right to blow my own horn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 12]: They pressed upon Penrod , who frantically fended and frantically blew .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 17]: At last he remembered to compress his lips , and force the air through the compression .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 10]: A magnificent snort from the horn was his reward .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 13]: He removed his lips from the mouthpiece , and capered in pride .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 4]: `` Hah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 4]: `` Hear that ?
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 13]: I guess _ I _ ca n't play this good ole horn !
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 5]: Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 9]: During his capers , Sam captured the horn .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 35]: But Sam had not made the best of his opportunities as an observer of bands ; he thrust the mouthpiece deep into his mouth , and blew until his expression became one of agony .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 3]: Penrod exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 15]: `` You have n't got the secret of blowin ' a horn , Sam .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 23]: What 's the use your keepin ' hold of it , when you do n't know any more about it 'n that ?
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 8]: It ai n't makin ' a sound !
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 12]: You lem me have that good ole horn back , Sam .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 15]: Have n't you got sense enough to see I know how to PLAY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 39]: Laying hands upon it , he jerked it away from Sam , who was a little piqued over the failure of his own efforts , especially as Penrod now produced a sonarous blat -- quite a long one .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 4]: Sam became cross .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 5]: `` My goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 5]: Roddy Bitts said peevishly .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 16]: `` Ai n't I ever goin ' to get a turn at my own horn ?
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 60]: Here you 've had two turns , Penrod , and even Sam Williams -- '' Sam 's petulance at once directed itself toward Roddy partly because of the latter 's tactless use of the word `` even , '' and the two engaged in controversy , while Penrod was left free to continue the experiments which so enraptured him .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 6]: `` Your own horn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 3]: Sam sneered .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 8]: `` I bet it is n't yours !
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 27]: Anyway , you ca n't prove it 's yours , and that gives me a right to call you any -- '' `` You better not !
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 7]: It is , too , mine .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 9]: It 's just the same as mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 63]: `` No , sir , '' said Sam ; `` I bet you got to take it back where you got it , and that 's not anything like the same as yours ; so I got a perfect right to call you whatev -- '' `` I do NOT haf to take it back where I got it , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 20]: Roddy cried , more and more irritated by his opponent 's persistence in stating his rights in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 16]: `` I BET they told you to bring it back , '' said Sam tauntingly .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 7]: `` They did n't , either !
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 7]: There was n't anybody there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 3]: `` Yay !
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 15]: Then you got to get it back before they know it 's gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 10]: `` I do n't either any such a thing !
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 13]: I heard my Uncle Ethelbert say Sunday he did n't want it .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 20]: He said he wished somebody 'd take that horn off his hands so 's he could buy sumpthing else .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 8]: That 's just exactly what he said .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 7]: I heard him tell my mother .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 26]: He said , ' I guess I prackly got to give it away if I 'm ever goin ' to get rid of it . '
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 47]: Well , when my own uncle says he wants to give a horn away , and he wishes he could get rid of it , I guess it 's just the same as mine , soon as I go and take it , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 9]: I 'm goin ' to keep it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 23]: Sam was shaken , but he had set out to demonstrate those rights of his and did not mean to yield them .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 31]: `` Yes ; you 'll have a NICE time , '' he said , `` next time your uncle goes to play on that horn and ca n't find it .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 21]: No , sir ; I got a perfect ri -- '' `` My uncle do n't PLAY on it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 3]: Roddy shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 19]: `` It 's an ole wore-out horn nobody wants , and it 's mine , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 28]: I can blow on it , or bust it , or kick it out in the alley and leave it there , if I want to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 8]: `` No , you ca n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 7]: `` I can , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 7]: `` No , you ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 24]: You ca n't PROVE you can , and unless you prove it , I got a perf -- '' Roddy stamped his foot .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 7]: `` I can , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 3]: he shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 11]: `` You ole durn jackass , I can , too !
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 23]: I can , can , can , can -- '' Penrod suddenly stopped his intermittent production of blats , and intervened . ''
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 17]: _ I _ know how you can prove it , Roddy , '' he said briskly .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 29]: `` There 's one way anybody can always prove sumpthing belongs to them , so that nobody 'd have a right to call them what they wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 10]: You can prove it 's yours , EASY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 15]: `` Well , '' said Penrod , `` if you give it away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 6]: `` What you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 5]: asked Roddy , frowning .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 11]: `` Well , look here , '' Penrod began brightly .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 18]: `` You ca n't give anything away that does n't belong to you , can you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 60]: `` So , then , '' the resourceful boy continued , `` f ' r instance , if you give this ole horn to me , that 'd prove it was yours , and Sam 'd haf to say it was , and he would n't have any right to -- '' `` I wo n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 4]: said Roddy sourly .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 11]: `` I do n't want to give you that horn .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 12]: What I want to give you anything at all for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 20]: Penrod sighed , as if the task of reaching Roddy 's mind with reason were too heavy for him .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 38]: `` Well , if you do n't want to prove it , and rather let us have the right to call you anything we want to -- well , all right , then , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 10]: `` You look out what you call me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 19]: Roddy cried , only the more incensed , in spite of the pains Penrod was taking with him .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 9]: `` I do n't haf to prove it .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 5]: It 's MINE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 10]: `` What kind o ' proof is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 5]: Sam Williams demanded severely .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 14]: `` You GOT to prove it and you ca n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 24]: Roddy began a reply , but his agitation was so great that what he said had not attained coherency when Penrod again intervened .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 7]: He had just remembered something important .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 11]: `` Oh , _ I _ know , Roddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 21]: `` If you sell it , that 'd prove it was yours almost as good as givin ' it away .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 8]: What 'll you take for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 14]: `` I do n't want to sell it , '' said Roddy sulkily .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 3]: `` Yay !
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 2]: Yay !
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 3]: YAY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 20]: shouted the taunting Sam Williams , whose every word and sound had now become almost unbearable to Master Bitts .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 25]: Sam was usually so good-natured that the only explanation of his conduct must lie in the fact that Roddy constitutionally got on his nerves .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 9]: `` He KNOWS he ca n't prove it !
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 19]: He 's a goner , and now we can begin callin ' him anything we can think of !
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 10]: I choose to call him one first , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 11]: Roddy , you 're a -- '' `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 17]: shouted Penrod , for he really believed Roddy 's claims to be both moral and legal .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 61]: When an uncle who does not even play upon an old second-hand horn wishes to get rid of that horn , and even complains of having it on his hands , it seems reasonable to consider that the horn becomes the property of a nephew who has gone to the trouble of carrying the undesired thing out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 6]: Penrod determined to deal fairly .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 26]: The difference between this horn and the one in the `` music-store '' window seemed to him just about the difference between two and eighty-five .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 10]: He drew forth the green bill from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 19]: `` Roddy , '' he said , `` I 'll give you two dollars for that horn . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 12]: Sam Williams 's mouth fell open ; he was silenced indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 24]: But for a moment , the confused and badgered Roddy was incredulous ; he had not dreamed that Penrod possessed such a sum .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 11]: `` Lem me take a look at that money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 28]: If at first there had been in Roddy 's mind a little doubt about his present rights of ownership , he had talked himself out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 19]: Also , his financial supplies for the month were cut off , on account of the careless dog .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 13]: Finally , he thought that the horn was worth about fifty cents .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 9]: `` I 'll do it , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 5]: he said with decision .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 15]: Thereupon Penrod shouted aloud , prancing up and down the carriage-house with the horn .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 14]: Roddy was happy , too , land mingled his voice with Penrod 's .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 3]: `` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 2]: Hi !
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 3]: Hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 4]: shouted Roddy Bitts .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 18]: `` I 'm goin ' to buy me an air-gun down at Fox 's hardware store ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 6]: And he departed , galloping .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 7]: ... He returned the following afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 32]: School was over , and Penrod and Sam were again in the stable ; Penrod `` was practising '' upon the horn , with Sam for an unenthusiastic spectator and auditor .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 11]: Master Bitts ' brow was heavy ; he looked uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 22]: `` Penrod , '' he began , `` I got to -- '' Penrod removed the horn briefly from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 21]: `` Do n't come bangin ' around here and interrup ' me all the time , '' he said severely .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 7]: `` I got to practice . ''
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 10]: And he again pressed the mouthpiece to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 10]: He was not of those whom importance makes gracious .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 20]: `` Look here , Penrod , '' said Roddy , `` I got to have that horn back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 9]: Penrod lowered the horn quickly enough at this .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 8]: `` What you talkin ' about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 48]: `` What you want to come bangin ' around here for and -- '' `` I came around here for that horn , '' Master Bitts returned , and his manner was both dogged and apprehensive , the apprehension being more prevalent when he looked at Sam .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 12]: `` I got to have that horn , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 18]: Sam , who had been sitting in the wheelbarrow , jumped up and began to dance triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 3]: `` Yay !
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 8]: It WAS N'T his , after all !
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 15]: Roddy Bitts told a big l -- '' `` I never , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 4]: Roddy almost wailed .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 12]: `` Well , what you want the horn back for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 5]: the terrible Sam demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 8]: `` Well , 'cause I want it .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 17]: I got a right to want it if I want to , have n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 8]: Penrod 's face had flushed with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 12]: `` You look here , Sam , '' he began hotly .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 13]: `` Did n't you hear Roddy say this was his horn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 6]: `` He said it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 3]: Sam declared .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 9]: `` He said it a million times ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 14]: `` Well , and did n't he sell this horn to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 6]: `` Yes , SIR ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 13]: `` Did n't I pay him money cash down for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 5]: `` Two dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 14]: `` Well , and ai n't it my horn now , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 6]: `` You bet you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 6]: `` YES , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 6]: Penrod went on with vigour .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 32]: `` It 's my horn now whether it belonged to you or not , Roddy , because you SOLD it to me and I paid my good ole money for it .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 22]: I guess a thing belongs to th ` , person that paid their own money for it , does n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 36]: _ I _ do n't haf to give up my own propaty , even if you did come on over here and told us a big l -- '' '' _ I _ NEVER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 3]: shouted Roddy .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 19]: `` It was my horn , too , and I did n't tell any such a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 23]: He paused ; then , reverting to his former manner , said stubbornly , `` I got to have that horn back .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 5]: I GOT to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 13]: `` Why 'n' t you tell us what FOR , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 3]: Sam insisted .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 11]: Roddy 's glance at this persecutor was one of anguish .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 10]: `` I know my own biz ` nuss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 11]: And while Sam jeered , Roddy turned to Penrod desperately .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 8]: `` You gim me that horn back !
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 7]: I got to have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 7]: But Penrod followed Sam 's lead .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 13]: `` Well , why ca n't you tell us what FOR ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 14]: Perhaps if Sam had not been there , Roddy could have unbosomed himself .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 33]: He had no doubt of his own virtue in this affair , and he was conscious that he had acted in good faith throughout -- though , perhaps , a little impulsively .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 36]: But he was in a predicament , and he knew that if he became more explicit , Sam could establish with undeniable logic those rights about which he had been so odious the day before .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 24]: Such triumph for Sam was not within Roddy 's power to contemplate ; he felt that he would rather die , or sumpthing .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 9]: `` I got to have that horn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 4]: he reiterated woodenly .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 38]: Penrod had no intention to humour this preposterous boy , and it was only out of curiosity that he asked , `` Well , if you want the horn back , where 's the two dollars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 5]: `` I spent it .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 21]: I bought an air-gun for a dollar and sixty-five cents , and three sodies and some candy with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 10]: I 'll owe you the two dollars , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 9]: I 'm willing to do that much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 26]: `` Well , why do n't you give him the air-gun , '' asked the satirical Sam , `` and owe him the rest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 5]: `` I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 18]: Papa took the air-gun away from me because he did n't like sumpthing I did with it .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 13]: I got to owe you the whole two dollars , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 10]: `` Look here , Roddy , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 26]: `` Do n't you s ` pose I 'd rather keep this horn and blow on it than have you owe me two dollars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 16]: There was something about this simple question which convinced Roddy that his cause was lost .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 13]: His hopes had been but faint from the beginning of the interview .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 7]: `` Well -- '' said Roddy .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 11]: For a time he scuffed the floor with his shoe .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 5]: `` Daw-gone it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 11]: he said , at last ; and he departed morosely .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 41]: Penrod had already begun to `` practice '' again , and Mr. Williams , after vain appeals to be permitted to practice in turn , sank into the wheelbarrow in a state of boredom , not remarkable under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 22]: Then Penrod contrived -- it may have been accidental -- to produce at one blast two tones which varied in pitch .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 10]: His pride and excitement were extreme though not contagious .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 6]: `` Listen , Sam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 8]: `` How 's THAT for high ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 22]: The bored Sam made no response other than to rise languidly to his feet , stretch , and start for home .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 18]: Left alone , Penrod 's practice became less ardent ; he needed the stimulus of an auditor .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 18]: With the horn upon his lap he began to rub the greenish brass surface with a rag .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 15]: He meant to make this good ole two-dollar horn of his LOOK like sumpthing !
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 31]: Presently , moved by a better idea , he left the horn in the stable and went into the house , soon afterward appearing before his mother in the library .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 21]: `` Mamma , '' he said , complainingly , `` Della wo n't -- '' But Mrs. Schofield checked him .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 13]: `` Sh , Penrod ; your father 's reading the paper . ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 22]: Penrod glanced at Mr. Schofield , who sat near the window , reading by the last light of the early sunset .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 15]: `` Well , I know it , '' said Penrod , lowering his voice .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 16]: `` But I wish you 'd tell Della to let me have the silver polish .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 27]: She says she wo n't , and I want to -- '' `` Be quiet , Penrod , you ca n't have the silver polish . ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 11]: `` But , mamma -- '' `` Not another word .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 10]: Ca n't you see you 're interrupting your father .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 6]: Go on , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 37]: Mr. Schofield read aloud several despatches from abroad , and after each one of them Penrod began in a low but pleading tone : `` Mamma , I want -- '' `` SH , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 23]: Mr. Schofield continued to read , and Penrod remained in the room , for he was determined to have the silver polish .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 24]: `` Here 's something curious , '' said Mr. Schofield , as his eye fell upon a paragraph among the `` locals . ''
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 10]: `` Valuable relic missing , '' Mr. Schofield read .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 33]: `` It was reported at police headquarters to-day that a ` valuable object had been stolen from the collection of antique musical instruments owned by E. Magsworth Bitts , 724 Central Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 41]: The police insist that it must have been an inside job , but Mr. Magsworth Bitts inclines to think it was the work of a negro , as only one article was removed and nothing else found to be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 25]: The object stolen was an ancient hunting-horn dating from the eighteenth century and claimed to have belonged to Louis XV , King of France .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 12]: It was valued at about twelve hundred and fifty dollars . ''
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 7]: Mrs. Schofield opened her mouth wide .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 8]: `` Why , that IS curious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 4]: She jumped up .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 4]: `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 9]: But Penrod was no longer in the room .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 4]: Mr. Schofield inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 4]: `` Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 5]: said Mrs. Schofield breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 15]: `` HE bought an old horn -- like one in old hunting-pictures -- yesterday !
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 11]: He bought it with some money Uncle Joe gave him !
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 8]: He bought it from Roddy Bitts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 7]: `` Where 'd he go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 8]: Together they rushed to the back porch .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 62]: Penrod had removed the lid of the cistern ; he was kneeling beside it , and the fact that the diameter of the opening into the cistern was one inch less than the diameter of the coil of Louis the Fifteenth 's hunting-horn was all that had just saved Louis the Fifteenth 's hunting-horn from joining the drowned trousers of Herman .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 14]: Such was Penrod 's instinct , and thus loyally he had followed it .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 12]: ... He was dragged into the library , expecting anything whatever .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 22]: The dreadful phrases of the newspaper item rang through his head like the gongs of delirium : `` Police headquarters ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 7]: `` Work of a negro ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 6]: `` King of France ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 11]: `` Valued at about twelve hundred and fifty dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 13]: Eighty-five dollars had dismayed him ; twelve hundred and fifty was unthinkable .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 9]: Nightmares were coming to life before his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 23]: But a light broke slowly ; it came first to Mr. and Mrs. Schofield , and it was they who illuminated Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 28]: Slowly , slowly , as they spoke more and more pleasantly to him , it began to dawn upon him that this trouble was all Roddy 's .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 25]: And when Mr. Schofield went to take the horn to the house of Mr. Ethelbert Magsworth Bitts , Penrod sat quietly with his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 10]: Mr. Schofield was gone an hour and a half .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 26]: Upon his solemn return he reported that Roddy 's father had been summoned by telephone to bring his son to the house of Uncle Ethelbert .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 33]: Mr. Bitts had forthwith appeared with Roddy , and , when Mr. Schofield came away , Roddy was still -LRB- after half an hour 's previous efforts -RRB- explaining his honourable intentions .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 26]: Mr. Schofield indicated that Roddy 's condition was agitated , and that he was having a great deal of difficulty in making his position clear .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 29]: Penrod 's imagination paused outside the threshold of that room in Mr. Ethelbert Magsworth Bitts ' house , and awe fell upon him when he thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 18]: Roddy seemed to have disappeared within a shrouding mist where Penrod 's mind refused to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 11]: `` Well , he got back his ole horn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 8]: said Sam after school the next afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 16]: `` I KNEW we had a perfect right to call him whatever we wanted to !
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 15]: I bet you hated to give up that good ole horn , Penrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 5]: But Penrod was serene .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 7]: He was even a little superior .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 4]: `` Pshaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 17]: `` I 'm goin ' to learn to play on sumpthing better 'n any ole horn .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 23]: It 's lots better , because you can carry it around with you anywhere , and you could n't a horn . ''
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 17]: Sam asked , not too much pleased by Penrod 's air of superiority and high content .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 10]: `` You mean a jew 's - harp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 5]: `` I guess not !
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 12]: I mean a flute with all silver on it and everything .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 11]: My father 's goin ' to buy me one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 8]: `` I bet he is n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 20]: `` He is , too , '' said Penrod ; `` soon as I 'm twenty-one years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 97]: THE PARTY ____________________________ | | | Miss Amy Rennsdale | | | | At Home | | Saturday , the twenty-third | | from three to six | | | | R.s.v.p. Dancing | ---------------------------- This little card , delicately engraved , betokened the hospitality incidental to the ninth birthday anniversary of Baby Rennsdale , youngest member of the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class , and , by the same token , it represented the total social activity -LRB- during that season -RRB- of a certain limited bachelor set consisting of Messrs. Penrod Schofield and Samuel Williams .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 22]: The truth must be faced : Penrod and Sam were seldom invited to small parties ; they were considered too imaginative .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 35]: But in the case of so large an affair as Miss Rennsdale 's , the feeling that their parents would be sensitive outweighed fears of what Penrod and Sam might do at the party .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 15]: Reputation is indeed a bubble , but sometimes it is blown of sticky stuff .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 30]: The comrades set out for the fete in company , final maternal outpourings upon deportment and the duty of dancing with the hostess evaporating in their freshly cleaned ears .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 25]: Both boys , however , were in a state of mind , body , and decoration appropriate to the gala scene they were approaching .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 42]: Their collars were wide and white ; inside the pockets of their overcoats were glistening dancing-pumps , wrapped in tissue-paper ; inside their jacket pockets were pleasant-smelling new white gloves , and inside their heads solemn timidity commingled with glittering anticipations .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 58]: Before them , like a Christmas tree glimpsed through lace curtains , they beheld joy shimmering -- music , ice-cream , macaroons , tinsel caps , and the starched ladies of their hearts Penrod and Sam walked demurely yet almost boundingly ; their faces were shining but grave -- they were on their way to the Party !
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 6]: `` Look at there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 3]: said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 7]: `` There 's Carlie Chitten ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 4]: Sam asked . ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 5]: ` Cross the street .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 8]: Have n't you got any eyes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 19]: `` Well , why n't you say he was ` cross the street in the first place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 4]: Sam returned plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 15]: `` Besides , he 's so little you ca n't hardly see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 30]: This was , of course , a violent exaggeration , though Master Chitten , not yet eleven years old , was an inch or two short for his age .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 11]: `` He 's all dressed up , '' Sam added .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 9]: `` I guess he must be invited . ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 11]: `` I bet he does sumpthing , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 12]: `` I bet he does , too , '' Sam agreed .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 46]: This was the extent of their comment upon the small person across the street ; but , in spite of its non-committal character , the manner of both commentators seemed to indicate that they had just exchanged views upon an interesting and even curious subject .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 15]: They walked along in silence for several minutes , staring speculatively at Master Chitten .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 8]: His appearance was pleasant and not remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 46]: He was a handsome , dark little boy , with quick eyes and a precociously reserved expression ; his air was `` well-bred '' ; he was exquisitely neat , and he had a look of manly competence that grown people found attractive and reassuring .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 21]: In short , he was a boy of whom a timid adult stranger would have inquired the way with confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 18]: And yet Sam and Penrod had mysterious thoughts about him -- obviously there was something subterranean here .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 53]: They continued to look at him for the greater part of block , when , their progress bringing them in sight of Miss Amy Rennsdale 's place of residence their attention was directed to a group of men bearing festal burdens -- encased violins , a shrouded harp and other beckoning shapes .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 35]: There were signs , too , that most of `` those invited '' intended to miss no moment of this party ; guests already indoors watched from the windows the approach of the musicians .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 58]: Washed boys in black and white , and girls in tender colours converged from various directions , making gayly for the thrilling gateway -- and the most beautiful little girl in all the world , Marjorie Jones , of the amber curls , jumped from a carriage step to the curbstone as Penrod and Sam came up .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 5]: She waved to them .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 25]: Sam responded heartily ; but Penrod , feeling real emotion and seeking to conceal it , muttered , '' ` Lo , Marjorie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 7]: gruffly , offering no further demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 42]: Marjorie paused a moment , expectant , and then , as he did not seize the opportunity to ask her for the first dance , she tried not to look disappointed and ran into the house ahead of the two boys .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 54]: Penrod was scarlet ; he wished to dance the first dance with Marjorie , and the second and the third and all the other dances , and he strongly desired to sit with her `` at refreshments '' ; but he had been unable to ask for a single one of these privileges .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 49]: It would have been impossible for him to state why he was thus dumb , although the reason was simple and wholly complimentary to Marjorie : she had looked so overpoweringly pretty that she had produced in the bosom of her admirer a severe case of stage fright .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 46]: That was `` all the matter with him '' ; but it was the beginning of his troubles , and he did not recover until he and Sam reached the `` gentlemen 's dressing-room '' , whither they were directed by a polite coloured man .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 27]: Here they found a cloud of acquaintances getting into pumps and gloves , and , in a few extreme cases , readjusting hair before a mirror .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 34]: Some even went so far -- after removing their shoes and putting on their pumps -- as to wash traces of blacking from their hands in the adjacent bathroom before assuming their gloves .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 21]: Penrod , being in a strange mood , was one of these , sharing the basin with little Maurice Levy .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 16]: `` Carrie Chitten 's here , '' said Maurice , as they soaped their hands .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 11]: `` I guess I know it , '' Penrod returned .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 10]: `` I bet he does sumpthing , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 6]: Maurice shook his head ominously .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 11]: `` Well , I 'm gettin ' tired of it .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 35]: I know he was the one stuck that cold fried egg in P'fesser Bartet 's overcoat pocket at dancin ' - school , and ole p ` fesser went and blamed it on me .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 26]: Then , Carlie , he cum up to me , th ' other day , and he says , ` Smell my buttonhole bokay . '
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 27]: He had some vi ` lets stickin ' in his buttonhole , and I went to smell 'em and water squirted on me out of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 25]: I guess I 've stood about enough , and if he does another thing I do n't like , he better look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 32]: Penrod showed some interest , inquiring for details , whereupon Maurice explained that if Master Chitten displeased him further , Master Chitten would receive a blow upon one of his features .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 33]: Maurice was simple and homely about it , seeking rhetorical vigour rather than elegance ; in fact , what he definitely promised Master Chitten was `` a bang on the snoot . ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 14]: `` Well , '' said Penrod , `` he never bothered ME any .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 10]: I expect he knows too much for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 48]: A cry of pain was heard from the dressing-room at this juncture , and , glancing through the doorway , Maurice and Penrod beheld Sam Williams in the act of sucking his right thumb with vehemence , the while his brow was contorted and his eyes watered .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 13]: He came into the bathroom and held his thumb under a faucet .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 8]: `` That darn little Carlie Chitten ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 3]: he complained .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 14]: `` He ast me to hold a little tin box he showed me .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 18]: He told me to hold it between my thumb and fingers and he 'd show me sumpthing .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 23]: Then he pushed the lid , and a big needle came out of a hole and stuck me half through my thumb .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 13]: That 's a NICE way to act , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 15]: Carlie Chitten 's dark head showed itself cautiously beyond the casing of the door .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 9]: `` How 's your thumb , Sam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 5]: `` You wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 13]: Sam shouted , turning furiously ; but the small prestidigitator was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 40]: With a smothered laugh , Carlie dashed through the groups of boys in the dressing-room and made his way downstairs , his manner reverting to its usual polite gravity before he entered the drawing-room , where his hostess waited .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 25]: Music sounding at about this time , he was followed by the other boys , who came trooping down , leaving the dressing-room empty .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 41]: Penrod , among the tail-enders of the procession , made his dancing-school bow to Miss Rennsdale and her grown-up supporters -LRB- two maiden aunts and a governess -RRB- then he looked about for Marjorie , discovering her but too easily .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 25]: Her amber curls were swaying gently in time to the music ; she looked never more beautiful , and her partner was Master Chitten !
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 24]: A pang of great penetrative power and equal unexpectedness found the most vulnerable spot beneath the simple black of Penrod Schofield 's jacket .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 21]: Straightway he turned his back upon the crash-covered floors where the dancers were , and moved gloomily toward the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 10]: But one of the maiden aunts Rennsdale waylaid him .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 11]: `` It 's Penrod Schofield , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 5]: `` Or Sammy Williams ?
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 6]: I 'm not sure which .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 5]: Is it Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 4]: `` Ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 13]: `` Well , Penrod , I can find a partner for you .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 17]: There are several dear little girls over here , if you 'll come with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 19]: `` Well -- '' He paused , shifted from one foot to the other , and looked enigmatic .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 9]: `` I better not , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 37]: He meant no offence ; his trouble was only that he had not yet learned how to do as he pleased at a party and , at the same time , to seem polite about it .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 13]: `` I guess I do n't want to , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 5]: `` Very well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 11]: And Miss Rennsdale instantly left him to his own devices .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 28]: He went to lurk in the wide doorway between the hall and the drawing-room -- under such conditions the universal refuge of his sex at all ages .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 19]: There he found several boys of notorious shyness , and stood with them in a mutually protective group .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 25]: Now and then one of them would lean upon another until repelled by action and a husky `` What 's matter ` th you ?
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 7]: Get off o ' me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 26]: They all twisted their slender necks uneasily against the inner bands of their collars , at intervals , and sometimes exchanged facetious blows under cover .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 24]: In the distance Penrod caught glimpses of amber curls flashing to and fro , and he knew himself to be among the derelicts .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 44]: He remained in this questionable sanctuary during the next dance ; but , edging along the wall to lean more comfortably in a corner , as the music of the third sounded , he overheard part of a conversation that somewhat concerned him .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 29]: The participants were the governess of his hostess , Miss Lowe , and that one of the aunts Rennsdale who had offered to provide him with a partner .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 16]: These two ladies were standing just in front of him , unconscious of his nearness .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 22]: `` I never , '' Miss Rennsdale said , `` never saw a more fascinating little boy than that Carlie Chitten .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 20]: There 'll be some heartaches when he grows up ; I ca n't keep my eyes off him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 14]: `` Yes ; he 's a charming boy , '' Miss Lowe said .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 7]: `` His manners are remarkable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 29]: `` He 's a little man of the world , '' the enthusiastic Miss Rennsdale went on , `` very different from such boys as Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 6]: `` Oh , PENROD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 4]: Miss Lowe exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 9]: `` I do n't see why he came .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 10]: He declines to dance -- rudely , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 15]: `` I do n't think the little girls will mind that so much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 4]: Miss Lowe said .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 22]: `` If you 'd come to the dancing class some Friday with Amy and me , you 'd understand why . ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 4]: They moved away .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 31]: Penrod heard his name again mentioned between them as they went , and , though he did not catch the accompanying remark , he was inclined to think it unfavourable .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 9]: He remained where he was , brooding morbidly .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 19]: He understood that the government was against him , nor was his judgment at fault in this conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 28]: He was affected , also , by the conduct of Marjorie , who was now dancing gayly with Maurice Levy , a former rival of Penrod 's .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 33]: The fact that Penrod had not gone near her did not make her culpability seem the less ; in his gloomy heart he resolved not to ask her for one single dance .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 7]: He would not go near her .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 9]: He would not go near ANY OF 'EM !
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 43]: His eyes began to burn , and he swallowed heavily ; but he was never one to succumb piteously to such emotion , and it did not even enter his head that he was at liberty to return to his own home .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 18]: Neither he nor any of his friends had ever left a party until it was officially concluded .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 16]: What his sufferings demanded of him now for their alleviation was not departure but action !
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 26]: Underneath the surface , nearly all children 's parties contain a group of outlaws who wait only for a leader to hoist the black flag .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 45]: The group consists mainly of boys too shy to be at ease with the girls , but who wish to distinguish themselves in some way ; and there are others , ordinarily well behaved , whom the mere actuality of a party makes drunken .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 39]: The effect of music , too , upon children is incalculable , especially when they do not hear it often -- and both a snare-drum and a bass drum were in the expensive orchestra at the Rennsdale party .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 34]: Nevertheless , the outlawry at any party may remain incipient unless a chieftain appears ; but in Penrod 's corner were now gathering into one anarchical mood all the necessary qualifications for leadership .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 33]: Out of that bitter corner there stepped , not a Penrod Schofield subdued and hoping to win the lost favour of the Authorities , but a hot-hearted rebel determined on an uprising .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 29]: Smiling a reckless and challenging smile , he returned to the cluster of boys in the wide doorway and began to push one and another of them about .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 30]: They responded hopefully with counter-pushes , and presently there was a tumultuous surging and eddying in that quarter , accompanied by noises that began to compete with the music .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 27]: Then Penrod allowed himself to be shoved out among the circling dancers , so that he collided with Marjorie and Maurice Levy , almost oversetting them .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 18]: He made a mock bow and a mock apology , being inspired to invent a jargon phrase .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 22]: `` Excuse me , '' he said , at the same time making vocal his own conception of a taunting laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 15]: `` Excuse me , but I must ` a ' got your bumpus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 20]: Marjorie looked grieved and turned away with Maurice ; but the boys in the doorway squealed with maniac laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 4]: `` Gotcher bumpus !
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 4]: Gotcher bumpus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 3]: they shrilled .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 21]: And they began to push others of their number against the dancing couples , shouting , '' ` Scuse me !
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 4]: Gotcher bumpus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 9]: It became a contagion and then a game .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 28]: As the dances went on , strings of boys , led by Penrod , pursued one another across the rooms , howling , `` Gotcher bumpus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 7]: at the top of their lungs .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 29]: They dodged and ducked , and seized upon dancers as shields ; they caromed from one couple into another , and even into the musicians of the orchestra .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 19]: Boys who were dancing abandoned their partners and joined the marauders , shrieking , `` Gotcher bumpus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 32]: Potted plants went down ; a slender gilt chair refused to support the hurled body of Master Roderick Magsworth Bitts , and the sound of splintering wood mingled with other sounds .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 27]: Dancing became impossible ; Miss Amy Rennsdale wept in the midst of the riot , and everybody knew that Penrod Schofield had `` started it '' .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 36]: Under instructions , the leader of the orchestra , clapping his hands for attention , stepped to the centre of the drawing-room , and shouted , `` A moment silence , if you bleace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 18]: Slowly the hubbub ceased ; the virtuous and the wicked paused alike in their courses to listen .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 31]: Miss Amy Rennsdale was borne away to have her tearful face washed , and Marjorie Jones and Carlie Chitten and Georgie Bassett came forward consciously , escorted by Miss Lowe .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 46]: The musician waited until the return of the small hostess ; then he announced in a loud voice : `` A fency dence called ` Les Papillons ' , denced by Miss Amy Rennstul , Miss Chones , Mister Chorch Passett , ant Mister Jitten .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 23]: Some young chentlemen haf mate so much noise ant confoosion Miss Lowe wish me to ask bleace no more such a nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 9]: Fency dence , ` Les Papillons ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 45]: Thereupon , after formal salutations , Mr. Chitten took Marjorie 's hand , Georgie Bassett took Miss Rennsdale 's , and they proceeded to dance `` Les Papillons '' in a manner that made up in conscientiousness whatever it may have lacked in abandon .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 23]: The outlaw leader looked on , smiling a smile intended to represent careless contempt , but in reality he was unpleasantly surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 50]: A fancy dance by Georgie Bassett and Baby Rennsdale was customary at every party attended by members of the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class ; but Marjorie and Carlie Chitten were new performers , and Penrod had not heard that they had learned to dance `` Les Papillons '' together .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 6]: He was the further embittered .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 44]: Carlie made a false step , recovering himself with some difficulty , whereupon a loud , jeering squawk of laughter was heard from the insurgent cluster , which had been awed to temporary quiet but still maintained its base in the drawing-room doorway .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 8]: There was a general `` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 17]: followed by a shocked whispering , as well as a general turning of eyes toward Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 20]: But it was not Penrod who had laughed , though no one would have credited him with an alibi .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 23]: The laughter came from two throats that breathed as one with such perfect simultaneousness that only one was credited with the disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 21]: These two throats belonged respectively to Samuel Williams and Maurice Levy , who were standing in a strikingly Rosencrantz-and-Guildenstern attitude .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 18]: `` He got me with his ole tin-box needle , too , '' Maurice muttered to Sam .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 31]: `` He was goin ' to do it to Marjorie , and I told her to look out , and he says , ` Here , YOU take it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 18]: all of a sudden , and he stuck it in my hand so quick I never thought .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 5]: And then , BIM !
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 15]: his ole needle shot out and perty near went through my thumb-bone or sumpthing .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 11]: He 'll be sorry before this day 's over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 23]: `` Well , '' said Sam darkly , `` he 's goin ' to be sorry he stuck ME , anyway ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 31]: Neither Sam nor Maurice had even the vaguest plan for causing the desired regret in the breast of Master Chitten ; but both derived a little consolation from these prophecies .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 12]: And they , too , had aligned themselves with the insurgents .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 24]: Their motives were personal -- Carlie Chitten had wronged both of them , and Carlie was conspicuously in high favour with the Authorities .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 9]: Naturally Sam and Maurice were against the Authorities .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 9]: `` Les Papillons '' came to a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 18]: Carlie and Georgie bowed ; Marjorie Jones and Baby Rennsdale curtesied , and there was loud applause .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 47]: In fact , the demonstration became so uproarious that some measure of it was open to suspicion , especially as hisses of reptilian venomousness were commingled with it , and also a hoarse but vociferous repetition of the dastard words , `` Carrie dances ROTTEN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 18]: Again it was the work of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern ; but the plot was attributed to another .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 7]: `` SHAME , Penrod Schofield ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 19]: said both the aunts Rennsdale publicly , and Penrod , wholly innocent , became scarlet with indignant mortification .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 11]: Carlie Chitten himself , however , marked the true offenders .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 67]: A slight flush tinted his cheeks , and then , in his quiet , self-contained way , he slipped through the crowd of girls and boys , unnoticed , into the hall , and ran noiselessly up the stairs and into the `` gentlemen 's dressing-room '' , now inhabited only by hats , caps , overcoats , and the temporarily discarded shoes of the dancers .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 31]: Most of the shoes stood in rows against the wall , and Carlie examined these rows attentively , after a time discovering a pair of shoes with patent leather tips .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 35]: He knew them ; they belonged to Maurice Levy , and , picking them up , he went to a corner of the room where four shoes had been left together under a chair .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 56]: Upon the chair were overcoats and caps that he was able to identify as the property of Penrod Schofield and Samuel Williams ; but , as he was not sure which pair of shoes belonged to Penrod and which to Sam , he added both pairs to Maurice 's and carried them into the bathroom .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 42]: Here he set the plug in the tub , turned the faucets , and , after looking about him and discovering large supplies of all sorts in a wall cabinet , he tossed six cakes of green soap into the tub .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 51]: He let the soap remain in the water to soften a little , and , returning to the dressing room , whiled away the time in mixing and mismating pairs of shoes along the walls , and also in tying the strings of the mismated shoes together in hard knots .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 23]: Throughout all this , his expression was grave and intent ; his bright eyes grew brighter , but he did not smile .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 39]: Carlie Chitten was a singular boy , though not unique : he was an `` only child '' , lived at a hotel , and found life there favourable to the development of certain peculiarities in his nature .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 33]: He played a lone hand , and with what precocious diplomacy he played that curious hand was attested by the fact that Carlie was brilliantly esteemed by parents and guardians in general .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 17]: It must be said for Carlie that , in one way , his nature was liberal .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 37]: For instance , having come upstairs to prepare a vengeance upon Sam and Maurice in return for their slurs upon his dancing , he did not confine his efforts to the belongings of those two alone .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 29]: He provided every boy in the house with something to think about later , when shoes should be resumed ; and he was far from stopping at that .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 27]: Casting about him for some material that he desired , he opened a door of the dressing-room and found himself confronting the apartment of Miss Lowe .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 40]: Upon a desk he beheld the bottle of mucilage he wanted , and , having taken possession of it , he allowed his eye the privilege of a rapid glance into a dressing table drawer , accidentally left open .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 43]: He returned to the dressing-room , five seconds later , carrying not only the mucilage but a `` switch '' worn by Miss Lowe when her hair was dressed in a fashion different from that which she had favoured for the party .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 27]: This `` switch '' he placed in the pocket of a juvenile overcoat unknown to him , and then he took the mucilage into the bathroom .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 39]: There he rescued from the water the six cakes of soap , placed one in each of the six shoes , pounding it down securely into the toe of the shoe with the handle of a back brush .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 29]: After that , Carlie poured mucilage into all six shoes impartially until the bottle was empty , then took them back to their former positions in the dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 36]: Finally , with careful forethought , he placed his own shoes in the pockets of his overcoat , and left the overcoat and his cap upon a chair near the outer door of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 19]: Then he went quietly downstairs , having been absent from the festivities a little less than twelve minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 19]: He had been energetic -- only a boy could have accomplished so much in so short a time .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 25]: In fact , Carlie had been so busy that his forgetting to turn off the faucets in the bathroom is not at all surprising .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 7]: No one had noticed his absence .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 38]: That infectious pastime , `` Gotcher bumpus '' , had broken out again , and the general dancing , which had been resumed upon the conclusion of `` Les Papillons '' , was once more becoming demoralized .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 36]: Despairingly the aunts Rennsdale and Miss Lowe brought forth from the rear of the house a couple of waiters and commanded them to arrest the ringleaders , whereupon hilarious terror spread among the outlaw band .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 22]: Shouting tauntingly at their pursuers , they fled -- and bellowing , trampling flight swept through every quarter of the house .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 8]: Refreshments quelled this outbreak for a time .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 44]: The orchestra played a march ; Carlie Chitten and Georgie Bassett , with Amy Rennsdale and Marjorie , formed the head of a procession , while all the boys who had retained their sense of decorum immediately sought partners and fell in behind .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 27]: The outlaws , succumbing to ice cream hunger , followed suit , one after the other , until all of the girls were provided with escorts .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 23]: Then , to the moral strains of `` The Stars and Stripes Forever '' , the children paraded out to the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 37]: Two and two they marched , except at the extreme tail end of the line , where , since there were three more boys than girls at the party , the three left-over boys were placed .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 26]: These three were also the last three outlaws to succumb and return to civilization from outlying portions of the house after the pursuit by waiters .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 13]: They were Messieurs Maurice Levy , Samuel Williams , and Penrod Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 36]: They took their chairs in the capacious dining-room quietly enough , though their expressions were eloquent of bravado , and they jostled one another and their neighbours intentionally , even in the act of sitting .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 28]: However , it was not long before delectable foods engaged their whole attention and Miss Amy Rennsdale 's party relapsed into etiquette for the following twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 62]: The refection concluded with the mild explosion of paper `` crackers '' that erupted bright-coloured , fantastic headgear , and , during the snapping of the `` crackers '' , Penrod heard the voice of Marjorie calling from somewhere behind him , `` Carrie and Amy , will you change chairs with Georgie Bassett and me -- just for fun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 50]: The chairs had been placed in rows , back to back , and Penrod would not even turn his head to see if Master Chitten and Miss Rennsdale accepted Marjorie 's proposal , though they were directly behind him and Sam ; but he grew red and breathed hard .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 29]: A moment later , the liberty-cap that he had set upon his head was softly removed , and a little crown of silver paper put in its place .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 4]: `` PENROD ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 19]: The whisper was close to his ear , and a gentle breath cooled the back of his neck .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 13]: THE HEART OF MARJORIE JONES `` Well , what you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 5]: Penrod asked , brusquely .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 15]: Marjorie 's wonderful eyes were dark and mysterious , like still water at twilight .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 9]: `` What makes you behave so AWFUL ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 6]: `` I do n't either !
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 19]: I guess I got a right to do the way I want to , have n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 22]: `` Well , anyway , '' said Marjorie , `` you ought to quit bumping into people so it hurts . ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 3]: `` Poh !
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 8]: It would n't hurt a fly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 6]: `` Yes , it did .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 12]: It hurt when you bumped Maurice and me that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 6]: `` It did n't either .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 6]: WHERE 'D it hurt you ?
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 20]: Let 's see if it -- '' `` Well , I ca n't show you , but it did .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 10]: Penrod , are you going to keep on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 16]: Penrod 's heart had melted within him ; but his reply was pompous and cold .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 19]: `` I will if I feel like it , and I wo n't if I feel like it .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 6]: You wait and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 13]: But Marjorie jumped up and ran around to him abandoning her escort .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 20]: All the children were leaving their chairs and moving toward the dancing-rooms ; the orchestra was playing dance-music again .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 7]: `` Come on , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 3]: Marjorie cried .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 8]: `` Let 's go dance this together .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 4]: Come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 12]: With seeming reluctance , he suffered her to lead him away .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 37]: `` Well , I 'll go with you ; but I wo n't dance , '' he said `` I would n't dance with the President of the United States '' `` Why , Penrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 13]: `` Well -- because well , I wo n't DO it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 5]: I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 9]: I guess I 've danced plenty , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 7]: Let 's go in here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 27]: She led him into a room too small for dancing , used ordinarily by Miss Amy Rennsdale 's father as his study , and now vacant .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 28]: For a while there was silence ; but finally Marjorie pointed to the window and said shyly : `` Look , Penrod , it 's getting dark .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 18]: The party 'll be over pretty soon , and you 've never danced one single time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 14]: `` Well , I guess I know that , do n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 16]: He was unable to cast aside his outward truculence though it was but a relic .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 12]: However , his voice was gentler , and Marjorie seemed satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 16]: From the other rooms came the swinging music , shouts of `` Gotcher bumpus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 19]: sounds of stumbling , of scrambling , of running , of muffled concus signs and squeals of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 17]: Penrod 's followers were renewing the wild work , even in the absence of their chief .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 20]: `` Penrod Schofield , you bad boy , '' said Marjorie , `` you started every bit of that !
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 10]: You ought to be ashamed of yourself . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 17]: _ I _ did n't do anything , '' he said -- and he believed it .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 8]: `` Pick on me for everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 18]: `` Well , they would n't if you did n't do so much , '' said Marjorie .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 7]: `` They would , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 7]: `` They would n't , either .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 4]: Who would ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 10]: `` That Miss Lowe , '' he specified bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 9]: `` Yes , and Baby Rennsdale 's aunts .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 17]: If the house 'd burn down , I bet they 'd say Penrod Schofield did it !
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 18]: Anybody does anything at ALL , they say , ` Penrod Schofield , shame on you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 19]: When you and Carlie were dan -- '' `` Penrod , I just hate that little Carlie Chitten .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 17]: P'fesser Bartet made me learn that dance with him ; but I just hate him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 17]: Penrod was now almost completely mollified ; nevertheless , he continued to set forth his grievance .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 24]: `` Well , they all turned around to me and they said , ` Why , Penrod Schofield , shame on you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 9]: And I had n't done a single thing !
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 7]: I was just standin ' there .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 9]: They got to blame ME , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 4]: Marjorie laughed airily .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 25]: `` Well , if you are n't the foolishest -- '' `` They would , too , '' he asserted , with renewed bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 13]: `` If the house was to fall down , you 'd see !
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 10]: They 'd all say -- '' Marjorie interrupted him .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 16]: She put her hand on the top of her head , looking a little startled .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 6]: `` What 's what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 5]: `` Like rain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 3]: Marjorie cried .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 8]: `` Like it was raining in here !
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 18]: A drop fell on my -- '' `` Why , it could n't -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 28]: But at this instant a drop fell upon his head , too , and , looking up , they beheld a great oozing splotch upon the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 28]: Drops were gathering upon it and falling ; the tinted plaster was cracking , and a little stream began to patter down and splash upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 19]: Then there came a resounding thump upstairs , just above them , and fragments of wet plaster fell .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 16]: `` The roof must be leaking , '' said Marjorie , beginning to be alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 11]: `` Could n't be the roof , '' said Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 10]: `` Besides there ai n't any rain outdoors . ''
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 23]: As he spoke , a second slender stream of water began to patter upon the floor of the hall outside the door .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 29]: Marjorie cried , while the ceiling above them shook as with earthquake -- or as with boys in numbers jumping , and a great uproar burst forth overhead .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 12]: `` I believe the house IS falling down , Penrod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 3]: she quavered .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 11]: `` Well , they 'll blame ME for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 11]: `` Anyways , we better get out o ' here .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 9]: I guess sumpthing must be the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 11]: His guess was accurate , so far as it went .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 69]: The dance-music had swung into `` Home Sweet Home '' some time before , the children were preparing to leave , and Master Chitten had been the first boy to ascend to the gentlemen 's dressing-room for his cap , overcoat and shoes , his motive being to avoid by departure any difficulty in case his earlier activities should cause him to be suspected by the other boys .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 9]: But in the doorway he halted , aghast .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 27]: The lights had not been turned on ; but even the dim windows showed that the polished floor gave back reflections no floor-polish had ever equalled .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 18]: It was a gently steaming lake , from an eighth to a quarter of an inch deep .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 16]: And Carlie realized that he had forgotten to turn off the faucets in the bathroom .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 20]: For a moment , his savoir faire deserted him , and he was filled with ordinary , human-boy panic .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 20]: Then , at a sound of voices behind him , he lost his head and rushed into the bathroom .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 23]: It was dark , but certain sensations and the splashing of his pumps warned him that the water was deeper in there .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 26]: The next instant the lights were switched on in both bathroom and dressing-room , and Carlie beheld Sam Williams in the doorway of the former .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 8]: `` Oh , look , Maurice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 7]: Sam shouted , in frantic excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 17]: `` Somebody 's let the tub run over , and it 's about ten feet deep !
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 9]: Carlie Chitten 's sloshin ' around in here .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 13]: Let 's hold the door on him and keep him in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 41]: Carlie rushed to prevent the execution of this project ; but he slipped and went swishing full length along the floor , creating a little surf before him as he slid , to the demoniac happiness of Sam and Maurice .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 31]: They closed the door , however , and , as other boys rushed , shouting and splashing , into the flooded dressing-room , Carlie began to hammer upon the panels .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 18]: Then the owners of shoes , striving to rescue them from the increasing waters , made discoveries .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 23]: The most dangerous time to give a large children 's party is when there has not been one for a long period .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 42]: The Rennsdale party had that misfortune , and its climax was the complete and convulsive madness of the gentlemen 's dressing-room during those final moments supposed to be given to quiet preparations , on the part of guests , for departure .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 43]: In the upper hall and upon the stairway , panic-stricken little girls listened , wild-eyed , to the uproar that went on , while waiters and maid servants rushed with pails and towels into what was essentially the worst ward in Bedlam .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 17]: Boys who had behaved properly all afternoon now gave way and joined the confraternity of lunatics .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 17]: The floors of the house shook to tramplings , rushes , wrestlings , falls and collisions .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 9]: The walls resounded to chorused bellowings and roars .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 43]: There were pipings of pain and pipings of joy ; there was whistling to pierce the drums of ears ; there were hootings and howlings and bleatings and screechings , while over all bleated the heathen battle-cry incessantly : `` GOTCHER BUMPUS !
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 4]: GOTCHER BUMPUS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 62]: For the boys had been inspired by the unusual water to transform Penrod 's game of `` Gotcher bumpus '' into an aquatic sport , and to induce one another , by means of superior force , dexterity , or stratagems , either to sit or to lie at full length in the flood , after the example of Carlie Chitten .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 68]: One of the aunts Rennsdale had taken what charge she could of the deafened and distracted maids and waiters who were working to stem the tide , while the other of the aunts Rennsdale stood with her niece and Miss Lowe at the foot of the stairs , trying to say good-night reassuringly to those of the terrified little girls who were able to tear themselves away .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 25]: This latter aunt Rennsdale marked a dripping figure that came unobtrusively , and yet in a self-contained and gentlemanly manner , down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 5]: `` Carlie Chitten ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 10]: `` You poor dear child , you 're soaking !
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 13]: To think those outrageous little fiends would n't even spare YOU ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 34]: As she spoke , another departing male guest came from behind Carlie and placed in her hand a snakelike article -- a thing that Miss Lowe seized and concealed with one sweeping gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 21]: `` It 's some false hair somebody must of put in my overcoat pocket , '' said Roderick Magsworth Bitts .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 6]: `` Well , ` g-night .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 9]: Thank you for a very nice time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 12]: `` Good-night , Miss Rennsdale , '' said Master Chitten demurely .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 13]: `` Thank you for a -- '' But Miss Rennsdale detained him .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 24]: `` Carrie , '' she said earnestly , `` you 're a dear boy , and I know you 'll tell me something .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 11]: It was all Penrod Schofield , was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 27]: `` You mean he left the -- '' `` I mean , '' she said , in a low tone , not altogether devoid of ferocity .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 44]: `` I mean it was Penrod who left the faucets running , and Penrod who tied the boys ' shoes together , and filled some of them with soap and mucilage , and put Miss Lowe 's hair in Roddy Bitts 's overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 10]: No ; look me in the eye , Carlie !
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 10]: They were all shouting that silly thing he started .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 7]: Did n't he do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 6]: Carlie cast down thoughtful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 15]: `` I would n't like to tell , Miss Rennsdale , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 13]: `` I guess I better be going or I 'll catch cold .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 9]: Thank you for a very nice time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 12]: said Miss Rennsdale vehemently , as Carlie went on his way .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 7]: `` What did I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 21]: Carlie Chitten 's too manly to say it , but I just KNOW it was that terrible Penrod Schofield . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 33]: Behind her , a low voice , unheard by all except the person to whom it spoke , repeated a part of this speech : `` What did I tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 8]: This voice belonged to one Penrod Schofield .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 31]: Penrod and Marjorie had descended by another stairway , and he now considered it wiser to pass to the rear of the little party at the foot of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 41]: As he was still in his pumps , his choked shoes occupying his overcoat pockets , he experienced no difficulty in reaching the front door , and getting out of it unobserved , although the noise upstairs was greatly abated .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 14]: Marjorie , however , made her curtseys and farewells in a creditable manner .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 13]: Penrod said again , when she rejoined him in the darkness outside .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 7]: `` What did I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 22]: Did n't I say I 'd get the blame of it , no matter if the house went and fell down ?
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 17]: I s ` pose they think I put mucilage and soap in my own shoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 15]: Marjorie delayed at the gate until some eagerly talking little girls had passed out .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 13]: The name `` Penrod Schofield '' was thick and scandalous among them .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 17]: `` Well , '' said Marjorie , '' _ I _ would n't care , Penrod .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 33]: ` Course , about soap and mucilage in YOUR shoes , anybody 'd know some other boy must of put 'em there to get even for what you put in his . ''
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 3]: Penrod gasped .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 7]: `` But I DID N'T ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 7]: `` I did n't do ANYTHING !
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 41]: That ole Miss Rennsdale can say what she wants to , I did n't do -- '' `` Well , anyway , Penrod , '' said Marjorie , softly , `` they ca n't ever PROVE it was you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 13]: He felt himself suffocating in a coil against which no struggle availed .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 8]: `` But I never DID it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 5]: he wailed , helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 9]: `` I never did anything at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 36]: She leaned toward him a little , and the lights from her waiting carriage illumined her dimly , but enough for him to see that her look was fond and proud , yet almost awed .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 33]: `` Anyway , Penrod , '' she whispered , '' _ I _ do n't believe there 's any other boy in the whole world could of done HALF as much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 15]: And with that , she left him , and ran out to the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 22]: But Penrod remained by the gate to wait for Sam , and the burden of his sorrows was beginning to lift .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 22]: In fact , he felt a great deal better , in spite of his having just discovered why Marjorie loved him .
